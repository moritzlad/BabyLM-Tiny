Well you moved here. And Tasha would like to move back to Yorkshire. Get your feet off me ! reason really because Well she says she likes it up there. She hasn't spent so much time up there since she's been three. Mm because. I like Geordie accents. Mm I hear Kate 's engaged to a Welshman. Kate? Do I know Kate ? Erm yes you probably do.

We had a new television yesterday Fred, that's what she's talking about. What you did? Mm. She gave Tash and John her old one. Not me. Well you don't need it. Mm. Well they don't know whether it will be any good to them. They've got two. Got a better telly than we have. I think John wanted it to sort of have a fiddle It was gonna cost me a hundred and eighty pounds to have it repaired so I thought I might as well Suit yourself. pay the extra and have a new television set. Yeah well I think er if er if you had, how long have you had it? Eight? Ten years? Eight years at least. Well yeah. See something else is going to go isn't it? And I think you made a good choice of boxes, it's a bit small but It isn't really. Only it's only cos it hasn't got the extra The viewing area round the side, yeah, I know. isn't It's just cos you haven't got the extra round the, round the side, but it just looks small. You have the controls Underneath. underneath which aren't really so easy to see But you didn't have any controls on yours anyway. Down the side didn't you? I had them down the side. Did you? Mm but they were hidden in a box. Mm. Have you got erm a zapper? Oh I had with the other, I wouldn't go back to No. having to get But we did persuade her to have teletext. Good I'm very pleased. But she's got erm, you haven't got teletext have you, what have you got viewing. Fastext? Yeah that's even better isn't it? It might be when I get used to it . Just press text and the number Just press the yes just press the colour and hey presto! Yep. So she'll be looking at three So so she'll be looking at three five two and then contacting you and saying look I'm now Is that the holiday? I'm, I'm going off tomorrow to Madeira. Three five two.

Well she didn't persuade me but she said she thought it was a very good idea because it was on all the new sets and while I was buying a new set I might as well Buy the latest new set. I er I think erm it's silly not to have it er when you're going in for a new set. Mm. Yeah. I really didn't erm You really didn't want it did you? No I, I just wondered what use it would be to me. It's as good as watching a video watching your holiday programmes and everything else. There's all sorts, weather forecast er news items Ooh hmm I I didn't get it quite right last night cos I thought I'd hear the news and I I could, I got the news on What on teletext? Yes, but there's somebody talking out of the film Well you had your telly on didn't you? Yes, yes well you've got to pu You've got your superimpose on. you've got to put your mute on. Oh. You know? Any time. I mean if you just want the teletext all you do is press your mute and then you'll just have your teletext without the sound. But, well you can also But y I know you can mix it can't you? Yes I, I know that bit I didn't know you had to do something to stop the Mm yes just programme coming through. yes well it's only just like you do if you've not got erm teletext and you just wanted to see the picture. Oh well we'll have a go today on there. I just press the buttons and see what happens. I know you do. Well you'd left something on hadn't you? I went in and there's Heidi oh well I've just got all the script coming up on the screen and I've just got so and so for you and I Hadn't even read the book either but I've fiddled with Natasha's. I just fiddled with the controls till The thing that you you have to remember, which you tend not to at the beginning is that Ceefax is B B C for instance, so on one and two now if you change channel if you're on teletext and you want to go onto Oracle which is on three Three. you've got to go back to T V To change. to get to three and then back on to teletext Oh. you can't go direct. And that's er something that you tend to forget er initially, even, I mean I still sometimes still do. Mm. I was reading my instructions though and it said before you start pressing knobs Mm. Please read the instructions. read it because you can do a lot of damage pressing the wrong things. Mm. Mm. And did it also say in big capital letters please do not y let your granddaughter fiddle around with it? No. Oh. But on, on my other remote control if I wanted to alter the sound or the colour, that was on the erm remote control and it's just a little It's a good little picture. It's a good picture. Very clear. But sometimes like in the Proms, I had to keep lowering the sound Mm. too loud. Mm. Well I want to be able to do that easily. You can You can you just press Well you will be able to, there's no doubt about it. Yes I'll have to erm You've got it on volume. sort it out.

Oh come on I'll do it for you, well you've gotta press so and so, here you are I'll do it. So Know it all. tuned it in to the four channels and I said what about video How many channels you got? tt I said well you might as well tune in to that as well hmm How many cha cha channels have you got? I can have thirty Thirty. two is it thirty or thirty two channels on it? Thirty I think because it started at thirty when we pressed and went down mm looking at the channels, I think that was only thirty channels. What make have you got? Mits Mitsibushi? Yeah. That's mine, I've got a video my Mitsibushi is. What, video? Mm. Ah now you could do with Fred's Mitsibushi video couldn't you? Yes because on the remote control it's for a video as well you see Mm. but it doesn't work my video. You know if you have the telly on number eight so you were on the video channel? Mm? Do you use your video remote control? Mm. That's okay then, I won't muck it up. Yes you can. But you can't use the video controls on the television panel Not the video, you mustn't use the video bit on the television television on my video. No but you're on the video channel. No you must use the video remote control that goes with the video. That's what I mean. Yeah, yeah. If you're on the video channel and you want to change the channel When Nana's got her Mitsibushi video then you can use it all on one. Then you use your video remote control, oh You've got to have the two Yeah. you must have the two separate ones. I don't want you messing it up. Yes, yes yes, yes! I know, I know, I know. Can't afford another one. No then I'll have that one. Do you know what she said Fred What? What did I say? when I was wondering about having teletext or not? Mm. Have a teletext then when you die you can leave it to me and I Then I'll get one with Nicam. That's lovely. I didn't say when. You mean I'll have to wait a very long time. And I'd like a Nicam digital stereo. That's what we're gonna have on our new telly. Yeah but but er we can't receive stereo here yet can we?

We saw the Little Prince. Leicester Haymarket? That's right. Mm. Which is a story I am not familiar with. Well I've never It was sort of like their pantomime Yeah. but I wouldn't have said it was very appropriate for It couldn't have been their pantomime young children. because we Well I shouldn't have thought young children would have und understood it. Mm. But it was quite good wasn't it? Malcolm and Heidi went to London bef the Monday before christmas Yeah! No blinking Sam goes to me, cos we were, we were, we turned Arachnophobia off because people needed the toilet and erm there was Songs of Praise or, you know, something like that and they were talking about all this terrorism, somebody said oh I'm glad you didn't go to London said but I did and she goes oh no you didn't did you?worried about me going to London That was nice. I know. Because there weren't any tubes they had to walk along Haymarket. wherever it was Haymarket. and erm pass the theatre with Phantom of the Opera showing so Malcolm just went in to see if there'd be any tickets for the afternoon performance on the off-chance and they were putting on an extra matinee performance so lo and behold those two went to see Phantom of the Opera. Hey hey hey hey! Oh good. Mm. It was brilliant, so good. And then on the Saturday Tasha and John went to see it. Mm. And it was and I who wanted to see it in the first place . Excuse me! I didn't ever want to see Phantom of the Opera, no of course I haven't haven't Yes you have. really been interested in it, no. Who's starring in it now? He's good erm Peter somebody. Yeah. Nobody I know. Well I don't know but I mean not someone Not a well known famous famous. But he, he is really good. I w I wanted to see Aspects of Love with Michael Caine in, I mean Michael Ball, but he's not in it any more. Mm! There's a good erm Oh you've got rehearsal this afternoon. I know. We saw a trailer for a film, it's Mr was it? And anyway it's this bas er ba baseball player and he doesn't hit the ball you see, which ma doesn't make him famous so he finds this person and he makes him go back and he does hit the ball and becomes really famous and that special person's Michael Caine, it looked quite good. Michael Caine? You know Michael Caine? The Mm one who did Jekyll and all the Jekyll and Hyde And what else he did Did you watch it? Yeah. I didn't re I thought he actually made a person, I didn't realize he made himself into a person. It was himself that changed. I thought it was a bit stupid cos he was such a nice doctor and that. Mm. Who wrote that? Er Heidi's going to be Aladdin in er Wendy 's production. I've learnt my lines but I haven't really. That looks a bit long. You twiddle it like you do spaghetti . She's hoping to sing her song from Aspects of Love aren't you? Well I don't know about that. Well I can't really sing it. Well you sing it well. That's a load of cock and bull. I can't sing it. You can't? And wh and where's this, school or church or? St Pauls. St Pauls' drama group. Mhm. I want to go through to She doesn't really belong to the drama group now, she came out in September. Don't I get something cos no one 's got anything nineteen eighty four I started. You've been there nine years then. You will be the guest star so you should get Eight. Is that right? You've been there quite a whi well yes you'd been there seven years when you gave up hadn't you? Ninetee I started in nineteen eighty four Did you? cos we did Box of Tricks eighty six, the year before that we did Cinderella in nineteen eighty five and I started September October eighty four. Mm cos you were in the first one weren't you? Mhm. You were the little puss weren't you in Cinderella? Mhm. So eighty four, eighty five, eighty six, eighty seven, eighty eight, eighty nine, ninety, ninety one I would have been there eight, eight and a bit years. Next time you make this Vicki don't ask me if you should add any more liquid just add it . What? I'll save you a bit Luce, I'll save you a bit. Do you think I will come on last? I shouldn't starring part. But I'm thinking, I'm think I've got this terrible feeling I'd have to come on with the princess, if we've just got married Oh well you will then. to come through. With Angela? Mm. Want to come on on my own. Well perhaps you can. Princess and then, just shortly afterwards, Aladdin. Cos in Tom Sawyer we came on together didn't we? Mm. Which wasn't too bad. I'll save you a bit I thought she might have said something last year cos I was leaving. Well perhaps she thought you might change your mind. Perhaps she thought you wouldn't really leave. She was wrong then. Well are you making a guest appearance then? Yeah. Cos she'd been wanting to do Aladdin for a couple of years but it was on at The Playhouse And then it was on at the Theatre Royal. so she did Tom Sawyer, out of Huckleberry Finn. So that's the best one we've ever done Huckleberry Finn, it was good wasn't it? and then last year we did Peter Pan and I said right I'm leaving but she's always wanted To do it. to do Aladdin so when she thought she'd do it this year she wanted me for Aladdin. Come on then, jump For some silly reason come on then come on then come on. So we now have singing er rehearsals, you know er But I cannae not sing You can if you think about it. Not in tune to that one.

Windblowers Shermans Oh I seem to have gone down the drain a bit. Windblowers is right up Road Yes isn't it? The best thing to do is to ring first. I'll tell you where I had terrific service once, I can't remember what it was for now, it's it's a shop, it's called Arcade Records because originally it was in the arcade, but it's now just above the Cannon Cinema in between you know on Chapel Bar on the left hand side. And I wanted a particular tape, oh I know it was a tape I'd heard a coach driver using on the er on a coach trip that I was on so I got to know what it was erm and er I went round the usual shops no joy Nothing. and no sort of interest in in trying to do anything about it Yes that's the attitude isn't it, in the main. I went in to this fella er er er he seemed to know what I was talking about to start with That's a good start, yeah. and he said ah no problem I can order it for you if you'd like me to so I said I would and he said he'd phone me when er Mm. when he er got it. And he either phoned me the following morning or if it wasn't the following morning it was the one after that. Mm. That's good then. Mm I was very impressed. I can't remember seeing erm a music shop No you w mind you I don't We don't go go up there much do we? very often. You don't erm the other day I thought to myself I'll walk up, see if that shop's still there and by the time, you know er I was dreaming obviously, and I'd walked by, I'd got time actually, I was killing time so er I thought oh you silly I said er you've still not er found out, so I went back and it is there but it's not some, it's not a shop That you'd notice.

I've realized that I've never been out of love. Oh! Good for you. But you've never been loved. True. So we'll walk in the general direction of Tamsin . Alright. Okay. Has What she got a though?

It's balls! That's why I laughed. Balls! Look, you laughed, I laughed. Right, when I went to Turkey, I had three jabs before I went away and every two days I took two tablets. Ma anti-malaria tablets. Oh bless her! What? Well don't say that's overreacting cos I don't give a fuck! Don't give a fuck cos you could say that's overreacting but I haven't got malaria and Lisa has. So there's the proof for it. Ah shit! So that is so fucking sad! She's got malaria! Yeah, but it can be treated in this country. What? But, can't they treat it in this country? Yeah, they probably can. Yeah. Erm, cos then, they're doing tests to see if she has got it, but it's highly, highly likely that she has. So who have you phoned up then? Nobody. Zang told me. Oh Zang phoned you? How did Zang find out? Zang phoned Lisa. Oh Christ! He doesn't waste time does he ? Why? Just cos he phoned her. Well we know he fancies her right? No. He doesn't. He doesn't? He doesn't. Oh! They're friends. Do you want a Werther's Original? Yeah, please. I could roll this through the mud, spit on it and put it through dog's dirtisisism and most people would still say yes please. True? True. That was so funny! Ah God! I'm ill. How come? I'm bloody ill. Sore throat. Great! Ha aargh! These really help. Yuk! But blame John. No, on the letter though it did say er wha no I had to ring Sasha you know. I rang Sasha for my sister. Yeah? Funny thing was, Alex answered the phone and he knows my voice on the phone easily see. Yeah. Alex answers the phone. Hello. Hello, can I speak to Sasha please? Which I thought was quite funny. And I presume that he didn't? I don't think he's didn't say anything. He was probably crying though. But they got oh fuck that! they gotta be there from nine thirty till one. Do you believe that? Well They must use a . I wouldn't mind just one up there. Oh shut up! Look at Muhammad! I feel fine. There is a limit to how much I can take! No there isn't! There is actually because and you're coming bloody close to it. Dogs. The only thing I don't like. Oh. Tt. Shall we, erm have an excuse by saying you wanna co converse. She might be still asleep though. Yeah, probably. Alex is. Mm mm. At a rough guess. I think he's definitely asleep ! We don't need, we don't need the laws of erm we don't need the laws of physics as proof Alex is, is still in bed. I haven't got anything of, talking to my parents right, cos I just don't really. Oh yeah. I don't hold conversations with my parents. Mhm. Ha . Did you see Good Morning Vietnam? Mm mm, no. No? Missed it. I saw a bit. I would have watched it if I didn't have maths. Good morning Vietnam! I, I watched the first ten minutes which was really funny cos as they're going along in the truck ah look at that woman! Ah! Yes! Oh what a lovely body! And, and he goes no we can't, can we stop? Please! Please! Stop! Stop! Stop! And the guy driving the truck says, no we can't we've got an important meeting. Okay. So, the driver actually speeds up okay? And then, another woman, exactly the same clothes Aha. same hat, so it looks like the same woman so he says, oh my God! There she is again! She's, she's got this fa , how the hell did she get in front of us? Come on, please, the driver says I know, I know, speed up, let's test her stamina. Stopped her dead. Oh oh. Did you see that Robin William's thing, Acting Funny? No. Oh it was quite interesting. I actually Cos basically , Robin William films are either a film with a character and Robin Williams is the character, takes over the film and Robin Williams comes through, and it's funny. Okay? Okay. Now, you know, erm Good Morning Vietnam? Mhm. What it is, is it's a what, what, aha what it is er it's a film and basically it's a film with spaces in it for Robin Williams just to say jokes. Mhm. Basically to do a routine. Mhm. But the problem is, it's a serious film around that. Mm. Okay? And it doesn't work very well Mm. because yeah, you know the structure is is It's still a good , it's a fi , still a good You know the stru ,i , er, most people will be perfectly happy to watch erm two hours of Robin Williams being a funny D J Mm mm. but putting it around the, well apparently doesn't work. And then things like some of the stories like Yeah. the Fisher King Ah, that was good. that was apparently excellent! It was good. Which I never saw. But I'm sure it is. Which you will be opening to public on Channel Four. Yeah, probably. Yeah. Do you reckon they'll put Toys on? Nah! That's a likely possibility . Actually Muhammad, I don't reckon we should go this way. Why? Cos I don't reckon we should go and call on her cos that's a bit out of order. It's fucking early! And also What time is it then? What? What time is it? I dunno. I can't reach my watch. Quarter to ten. Also, if we co We only have to walk down also if we , no because if we walk down there and Right. they look out their window and see us you know So? What the fuck! So, I don't want anyone thinking What the fuck! Just come round this way Muhammad. No! What the fuck! I don't give a fuck! Fine. Fine Right. You go and make a complete prick of yourself. Why? But I'm, I don't particularly want to. Oh come on! No! You're not gonna be a ? Rosa isn't gonna, not gonna do it, Tamsin's not gonna do it right. You're gonna help me out about that . Cassie, we don't give a fuck about! Cassie Cassie's oh she has, she's seen Cassie. Yeah? Well Is that Cassie's car? Mm mm, well not Cassie's, it's somebody's though. Cassie's, yes it is. But, it's not Cassie I don't think. Erm Do you wanna or not? No, not particularly. Ah come on! Nope. Take a risk. No. If you, If you're game right and the entire field is full of mines and you need to get the last base. Shut up! You've gotta take No. a fucking chance! Muhammad, I have no objective of trying to reach here. Oh damn! What obje , I don't have an objective here. I was just, I'm just running through a field of mines, okay? Except there isn't another base at the end of it. What's in there? Now I've past the last base and you want me to just run through a minefield okay? And screw you! What? What? It's a terrible thing . What you on about? , what's ? Sarah. Oh! Oh no it did look er like her. Have you got a bus pass? Hop on a bus? What? Ah. Sounds alright actually. You got any money? How much? About a pound. Yeah, that's enough. No. Cos I don't wanna make a big thing of it cos if it was today we'd have to go before Sesame Street or after the Sesame Street. And I said I'd be back for around one cos I wasn't actually planning on doing much Ah but you going to Judo five, half past five innit? No next Tuesday or next Monday. Yeah sure. What? Go before and get there No but we can go before or after. Yeah, well the point is if she . If it's a Bank Holiday then she probably won't be open. She will be. No, cos of school.

And like Matthew's phoned me straight after when I was at Alison's and said oh Ben's . Do you spend a lot of time at Alison's ? Mm mm mm mm, not a lot. They must know to phone you there. Er, er yeah, but always there and Matthew know, Matthew knew I was gonna to make sure that your you know, because your problems are gonna be your neighbours problems. Yeah. Let's face it, we're quite selfish in the fact that we want to ensure that the area that we live in is safe for us and not too concerned that three or four estates down the road unless it starts to affect us . We don't want the problems on our own doorstep cos when the chips are down, we like to go home, and we like to feel safe and if somebody's entered your premises as an intruder then all of a sudden your security been taken away. It takes an awful long time for you to regain that and to feel safe in your own homes. Mm. So, if you do nothing else today, I'd like you to go home and assess the risk areas on your own individual houses. And have you actually ? If you haven't, then, you ought to phone your local beat officer and get him to come along and give you a survey I , I, I have phoned the police on numerous occasions and I must say, there isn't a great deal of response. Will, oh, it's all the response I get, we're far too busy we haven't got the manpower you know, er Well eventually they will have. a and this, this happens, you know. And that's the time to tackle it. I mean, I could come up I've even, I've even with the same excuse as that. I even sat on the local erm committee wi with the police authority, you know, and er we've got all sorts of promises but nothing that has ever materialized. When we query it, lack of manpower, lack of resources, lack of money. Well, we've got more police officers now than we've ever had before, we're not gonna get any more because, I mean, Essex Police Force, is quite a a rich one but I think, sort of, on recruitment, they've alre , probably due to get about fifty extra officers but that's . Which doesn't sound a lot from, er such a rural county, erm, but I mean, you know, obviously erm that is quite a lot, in terms because you are the people that are having to pay for it. Yeah. Do you think perhaps the problem is that, through no fault of their own, they spend far too much time in the police station doing other work perhaps, than going out on the beat? They're trying to cut that down, I mean, we have now, what is called, station officer's assistants and most police forces have them where they're civilian employees who do certain jobs to relieve the P C so that he can go back out onto the streets. Yeah. Compiling reports and goodness knows what else! Unfortunately , every thing you do in police force has got to be Gotta have reported. Yeah. And, that, it hasn't changed, in a very long while. Well I mean I'm er that wasn't meant as a criticism No. that was meant as, as a bit sympathy if you like, you know th But erm yeah sort of, the things that they have to do apart from fighting crime! Yes, but then Then I mean, you know there are things that we need to address in-house, to make sure that we give you er, an efficient service. And, like you say, if you're not Yeah. getting the response, if you're getting that type of excuse that comes out, then that's when you need to go back to them and say, well hang on, this is not good enough! I want a response! Alright, I'm prepared to wait depending you won't wait on a, a nine nine nine call, if it is Mm. an urgent call because that's got to take priority erm, but for other responses, then follow it up, don't just Yeah. accept it. Well I, I, as I say, I did follow it up and in fact, I even went to a committee where I sat and spoke to the er the police face to face and they made all sorts of promises but nothing materialized. Oh well, you'll have to stake it out again. Now I did bring a film along for you see and I'm hoping that it's going to work. But it just highlights some of the points erm it is humorous, so I hope that you enjoy it. And, it just shows you how easy it is to leave signs for the thief to tell him that we're out. This is where the technical bit always goes wrong even when Now is that done, that's tuned it right? Yeah. Try channel three. Going to switch it off . It's normally eight. . . That's right. I don't think we should put them through. Course it's a , talking, the only thing I can say, what you're saying about your erm problem in your area that, do you know if there's any crime actually committed on your estate? Is there a lot of crime Oh no! No! We don't get a lot No. really. I think we've, being a target, we've lived in which is since nineteen seventy three, I think we've had about three break ins. So no It's quite small really. which, which goes to show that maybe the officer, er saying maybe, I'm only throwing suggestions over there, cos I don't know Shenfield Yeah. that well, maybe the officer, the local beat officer has got a problem estate that he has to pinpoint and has to be there, or an area where the crime is being committed to try and deal with He's probably up in our estate! that, or, prevent that, whereas he knows that little estate round the corner, I know they look after themselves. Well why, why leave it totally ? Well, I'm probably You know! that's only a suggestion. The only trouble is I'm only saying that but yes, I I I take your point, er, as I say, I'm currently er a neighbourhood beat officer, I'm gonna become the crime prevention officer very shortly but I can go on estates like and they say, I haven't seen you for ages! I said but there's been nothing around here Quite honestly I monitor it Mm. by looking what the crime ra , who's But I I'd around I'd love someone like you to come around so I can come up to you and say this close is, er hello Geoff! You know Well yeah I If you've got a problem we we're . I'm very human , I do , and that's how I And some old dear old lady fell out, off the edge of the kerb That's right! because someone's parking right up the pavement. Over a cu , over a cup of tea, I could get a lot of information from you by saying But there is, there is, there is what's happening and various things. but there is literally no one that we can talk to like that. Yeah. I mean, if we've got problems with, with with house protection, you know. Yeah. But there's no one we can talk to, you know. Yeah. Cos you must have a local of crime prevention officer. There must be one somewhere. Well we have got one but I don't believe I've ever seen him. All you can say is could I make could I make an appointment to see you? And he says leave that to the local station, and say, can you leave a message with him to phone me back please. It doesn't, it doesn't happen. I don't ever, you see I'm I'm erm It doesn't happen like that ! I've I've I've phoned on numerous occasions. I er, I'll give you a classic example, I erm and my wife was with me Aha. for many years and I wheeled her around in a, in a Yeah. chair for that five years and, there were constantly people parking on the pavements, which necessitate you That's right, yeah. once or twice she were nearly no ,ne or the pair of us nearly got knocked down! Anyway, I phoned up the station and I said, you know, I've never seen anybody on the station, is there anybody could come and have a look at this because I'm sure we're gonna have a fatality before long, because, in my case it's my wife, it could be children who are playing there! Oh sure! And they said, well I'm sorry you know, er take the numbers of the cars, they want me to go round and take the numbers of the cars, phone them back and we will see if we've got someone that we can send down there! Well that's not the sort of liaison Well, yeah. that I want! Yeah. That's very poor management I would say, I'd be asking that bloke spoke to? Yeah. But this actually happened! Yeah, I dare say it did. Ah hee. Well yes. That's, that's how well he's talking to I don't think it doesn't look like we've managed to sort to that out so I'll move on. The other way, I mean, we can could actually try and help is to postcode your property I don't know if any of you have done that? But by simple erm, use of an ultra violet pen, using your postcode, followed by the door number or an abbreviation of the house name er,i that makes it identifiable. The postcode is broken down into, obviously figures and numbers, C M's, denotes sort of the Chelmsford area, or for whatever it might be in yo in your area, then you'll come down to either twenty, eighteen, whatever that is. It actually comes down to then, a more local area could be eighteen to twenty into Harlow, and then as you break down into the other figures, that then comes into a road and a postcode will actually go down to about fifteen houses in total, by putting your door number at the end of it, it makes it identifiable to your premises. That is the recognized form of marking for property nationally. All police forces will be able to check erm, if they, sort of find your video in the boot of somebody's car, they'll be able to check if it's marked. All you do, is you mark it on an item if you're gonna do the television do not do the screens, because every time you turn on up will come your postcode. Nor, do the back, because that can be removed you put it on a surface, the side or underneath that cannot be removed, and on a surfaces that's not regularly dusted and polished because eventually it will wear off. The other thing you cannot mark is compact discs Yeah. because they scan on ultra violet light and as one our P C's found out to his cost, he ruined a hundred and fifty pounds worth of compact disc cos he got rather carried away with and of course, it can't be cleaned off! We know that one as well. Okay? So don't mark compact discs. But it is an easy way of making your property identifiable. And as you're doing that make an inventory of sort of, items that have got serial numbers erm, so that if you do lose anything you've got a quick reference there for your insurance company. Most insurance companies now will specify, if you've had a burglary, the types of locks and they are now getting quite hot on it and they want good basic security of homes. So you've gotta go away, think like burglars, and think how easy is it, would it be for me to break into my own home? And if it takes you a matter of seconds, you really need to address your security. Well the er, the about that, when you said mark pieces of property Yeah. ya,, it, it's probably gonna be stolen anyway! The thief doesn't know whether it's been marked, cos usually they take in practise, what could the police be able to do? Well what we do is, if we if we know you've been burgled Aha. we then we, we regularly scout sort of all of the market stalls, the boot Oh. sales and we go over things. If we find property that we're, we're not happy with then all we've got to do is get it under ultra violet because all police forces do that and up will come the post code. Now most people can struggle to know their postcode, but you know might know yours. Mhm. I know your , but er, they ought to and therefore, you know, that is how we trace it. Th the one mark that we can trace. Some property you're not gonna get back. You see, on programmes like Crime Watch U K, where erm they've got these Aladdin's caves on all these stolen items that can never be returned to their owners, it's very, very difficult to sort of mark silverware and things like that without devaluing it? Ultra violet is one of the easiest ways. If it's jewellery it's harder, it will show up, erm if you're marking things like engagements rings, then the best thing to do is actually take photographs of them with a ruler or some sort of erm comparison of the size of the item cos if you do like a a ring on a photograph it's gonna, it's gonna come out like a , so if you got a ruler to say, you know, it's only sort of one and a half inches in width or whatever, then we can actually get a clear picture of, of that. But with that, I have to stress, do not snap away merrily at all your valuables and then take your film into Boots or Supersnaps or whatever with all your details on it, because you don't know who works there and who's going to pick up that and . And just,. You'll either have to use a polaroid instamatic camera and, or, go to a re a reputable photographer and make sure you get the negatives back. The sort of larger items the police have property marking kits that they're quite willing to lend out to people, or alternatively, you can hire them out on your library card, and you can dye stamp those or engrave them. And if you're going to do thin metal objects or a sort of aluminium frame, do not use the dye stamps on those. And all that is is a hammer and stamp and er and they have a habit of buckling because we regularly, erm postcode cycles erm, with the introduction of the mountain bike we found that on the weaker frames we were buckling them. And a mountain bike is quite expensive to replace! Erm, because they range from sort of anywhere from two hundred and fifty pounds erm, in excess of a thousand, so we now, as a matter of course, always engrave them. But it's exactly the same you just use the postcode. Do you, do you think the N P stickers that go on the doors or windows is a deterrent to burglars? N P, do you think it deters them? At one time it did displace crime. I still think that neighbourhood watches does what we're doing is we're pushing it out to Hertfordshire and the Metropolitan area and they're trying to push it elsewhere, and then, you know, we're just Yeah. pushing it away. But it won't deter the real erm Thief. professional thief. But those are few and far between. Most of them are opportunists, most of them come from the local area they'll know the housing estates and whatever happens . They've already chosen their set routes. They're familiar with the ground. And there are many contributing factors as to why er somebody turns to a life of crime, er, which is another argument, which I'm not gonna get involved with. Mm. Erm but, we are getting more and more opportunists lately. You know only as I say, it's made easy for them. It's like, sort of thefts of motor vehicles, we can reduce the theft of the actual vehicle, because there are security devices now to do that, to make it harder and you cannot odds somebody coming along the street, throwing a brick through a window and grabbing your cassette out. It takes a matter of seconds, and by the time the police have actually received the call, they're on route, they've gone. Most people are also scared to get involved now, because of the reprisals if they've actually reported some, to er, to a crime and you can a , understand that. I can understand that they don't want to get, to to go through the rigmarole of court. But the o , other thing is, you know, do you let these people get away with it? It's a matter for you as individuals isn't it if you witness something? But we haven't got a crystal ball, we don't know what's going on, unless you tell us cos we are relying on members of the public telling us things, saying that they've witnessed things what you saw. And that's a very difficult thing again, because most people's idea of description is different. We have a di , a different picture, and we make up erm pictures like you see o on these crime programmes, the videofits of suspects, you've all seen them where th , you know got the lines between the nose and, and the mouth they are made up of the information that we've gained from witnesses. As I say, but if there's I mean, how tall do you think I am sir? I dunno, about five foot seven, eight? Five foot eight? Well that's very flattering. Five foot five? Five foot five? Yeah. Five foot three to five foot four, five four. Right. Some of you might have taken into consideration the heel on my shoe. I'm actually five foot four I can't see that. so you're all wrong! I said five foot four! Erm It's only a foot! Yeah, it's only a foot. That's right. That foot ! And in , when we look for distinguishing marks on people Yeah. hair colour changes, size change, and you know, we'll say well what did the person look like? Well he had brown hair! Well there's many different shades of brown, you know. What was he wearing? Jeans. You know! What was he wearing on his feet? Trainers. White. Can you imagine, we have to try and make out a picture of that! Yeah. Oh could you? Mm. But, surely, coming back to the a highly say I didn't do it. I knew a chap on the police force and pretty irritant and pure walking around the like each day, trying to see if there's any . Well they can Yeah. but individuals have a responsibility for crime as well, because the ownership of, of crime problems is not just the police, it's down to the community in which that the people live. And this is probably the hardest Well surely we're trying to do this in the way of neighbourhood watch That's one of the ways, certainly. Couldn't you have a yo yo say And with with you want more more they want it both sides of the coin don't they? you see the officer walking, walking around in pairs continually, not and if you're gonna be paid extra for it, do it that way. If the police can't do it then somebody else has got to! I must be Right! said! To try somebody of a trainer er . Yes it's still I tell you yo That's right. I don't want my house broken into in the first place. I don't wanna be told that somebody and some remote things, like which was mine, and somebody would say, well he saw it and he saw the policeman ah they would come, they've never catch them! No. But this is, well this is You know, I don't blame you for that. This is the starting point isn't it? Rather than at all, where would you be I don't know. then? I don't know this afte , well it's it's a pretence to the You have a responsibl , bility Mm. of your own premises don't you? And how to secure those up. Yeah. Because at the end of the day you don't want somebody coming into your home. No I don't. No! Well tha that's really a fro market isn't it, once everybody That's it. takes reasonable precautions And that's all I'm asking you to do. to the best of their ability , but I mean, I take our friend's point of view, if they're marked, I mean, what's the chances of someone breaking into a home, what's the chance of er, them ever being er captured? Quite a lot in actual fact! I I would, I would have thought that there's Yeah. there's many more get away with it than there is actually captured ones. There are. But sooner or later they, they're going to start making mistakes bad mistakes, and that's when they, they come on Come a croppers. line to to be caught. Yeah. And then, we then we have to trace. I mean, police stations regularly become full of stolen items and we've got nowhere to put it, and we have to have these displays erm, where we try and and trace the owners, it's a, a very difficult job, it's a very time consuming job Yes. by marking your property at least it gives us a starting point especially if it's personal to you. I mean I, what you're saying's quite valid I mean,i if you've got a situation where you have been successful and you've got an accumulation of stuff that's been recovered from robberies, at least it gives you some method of returning it to it's previous That's right. owners. But we're relying on you to put it on there. But, it's it's not really a deterrent, that's the point we're making isn't it? It's it's one way because they don't want Yeah. identifiable property Mm. because it makes it harder for them to sell. Oh it does . Mm. Who's gonna sleep at night . They won't, but we will. Just, we just put our sign across it Yeah. that's the beauty of that. You can visible marker your goods, but that's even less attractive, but would you want an engraved mark across one of your prize possessions? Well actually, I think they're more suitable like that as though the insurance companies certainly don't ! They will Rather than, it's it's the sentimental value a lot of things, a lot of things . You normally client cooperation . I like that ! , you might the money back. That's handy, but Is it okay? Shall I ask? Quite a lot of people don't want them back Yeah. they've done well out the insurance ! They, they'd rather have the money, yeah! told though that the film is going to to actually work now so Don't be silly! They'll take it now, you know what I mean? Yes ! Can you hear that? Right. Okay. Something else I'd just like to, I was actually I was erm aware that time is passing us by. Who made the comment er, about people walking themselves at night ? Would that be safe to say that most of ? It's becoming sort of fairly topical erm where there, and it is, more perhaps related to the fear of crime than the actual crime itself, where, people are afraid to go out for fear that they're going to be personally attacked, whether it be you know, answering the door at night in their own homes, or actually, you know, going to their cars. None of us like to go in poorly lit areas, it automatically raises our fear level doesn't it? Or we feel unsafe. And we've all been in situations where we've walked into an area, whether it be, sort of a car park is poorly lit, or you've gone down a lane that's perhaps been overgrown by bushes and things like that we generally don't feel as confident. And it doesn't just apply to woman, it can apply to men as well. It's not something I particularly thought an awful lot of until I came on crime prevention, because before that I was in police uniform with marked cars with the radio, although half the time in Harlow, the radios don't work cos we're getting . But it, it didn't worry me and I liked to think I can go about my daily life and not be frightened, and I am not gonna be frightened to go out at night. . But on crime prevention, I'm for most part in plain clothes, I use my own car work and, I'm not in a marked car, I don't have a radio because my job, as I said from the beginning is very varied and therefore it's not practical for me to have a radio. So I'm out and about and quite often I go and visit people in their own homes out of the back and beyond of nowhere cos I just called out as a result of that and I suddenly thought I I'm highly vulnerable to them I could be subject to attack like anybody else, how will I protect myself? That was going to be erm , well I thought well I really haven't got the answer to that. So I immediately started to look into these things, which are personal attack alarms and it is a very basic er deterrent value. Many different types on the market, but when you actually start to look into them, erm, they reveal a few things, you can see by this one it's a fairly old one, but it is for for demo purposes only, this is one by Polycell, it's battery operated in a plastic cases and it's handy because it's got a torch but when you actually put the alarm on it goes my gadget's not working really. Oh! As you can see, the battery runs out! So I don't think they're very good. Erm as well as that, if you drop that, that's going to smash as one of my colleagues discovered. I thought well, I don't favour that, I'll go and have a look at cylinder type. This one is called a walk- easy very effective, particularly good for people with arthritic hands because erm it doesn't take an awful lot to actually press down the top. But how effective is it? When you start to discover this one actually does travel through walls, the sound of it does actually does travel through walls, but as I say, it's only a temporary measure to buy yourself a little bit of time she says. That's one on it's way out really so But that sound would be continuously repeated. It does. Yes. That one actually locks on. The one that I tend to use most of the time is this one not least, because it only three pounds, and it's quite affordable but a , again, it's got a loud sound to it, and I found that if you carry one of these with you and somebody does approach you, you've always got this in your pocket and you can actually aim it them, cos they don't know what you've got in your hand. If you actually put that up to near where he is it could even . Is it ! incredible isn't it ? I like the cylindrical type. I like this because you can actually Aha. clip it onto your clothes It's an idea, innit? Yeah. Yeah. it's handy to keep in your pocket if you're walking the dog at night. That's a nice one. So I thought well I'll carry one of these for when I'm going out in my car to which, you know,and if somebody does come up to me I can use it in a positive manner while in a split second time for me, hopefully beca , cos of my range of work Mm. to get out of that situation. I'm not a black belt in karate, and I'm don't suppose most of you are. Okay? There's a whole group on me then I'm not gonna stand about erm , but if it's a one on one I might stand a chance. So I think that is certainly worth it, if not least for the ladies to consider. It's an idea. But I want to bring something Mm. out which doesn't include the men. You've probably all been in situation where you seen people zigzag across the road because they think they're being followed the ladies will do it because she thinks a bloke is following her and the men are probably thinking does she think I'm following her? And carry on down the road. It's a very difficult situation because nobody knows how to react. Now, some men think right, I'll walk across the road others will think well I'll stay behind because it might be safer cos there might be somebody lurking in the corners none of us know quite how to react to that. And you'll find that the it's normally the woman that takes the initiative and crosses the road which she's unsure of. The idea is though, that you don't put yourselves in risk situations in the first place. You don't go into areas that are poorly lit if you can help it, you don't take a short cut through the dark woods because it'll save you five minutes on your journey, stick in well lit,we well lit areas. How many of the ladies here are drivers? Right. On the back er table there there's a brochure called Women at the Wheel, it's a Vauxhall er application please do take a good copy, very good application. Who knows the break down,el , the procedure for break downs on motorways? What you should and shouldn't do? Come on gents, you should know as well! Whether you stay with your car or not? That's understandable. Lock yourself in. Stay in the car stay with the car and put these erm, motorists lights on. Stay in the car? Mm. Any advances on that? Anybody think any different? Have one of those things in the car and you speak to the R A C or the A A Yeah. clearly But if it's lady,cos I couldn't afford one of those ! Yeah ! I know. They are expensive. Actually I think they're they're well advertised for what they are. No, actually, no don't sit in the car. The nearest phone. If you're on a motorway it's, it's maybe it's before you, every mile on a motorway there is an S O S phone box okay? When you pick up the rec , the, the hands it will actually take you through to the nearest police control room area now, if it's on the M eleven then most of the calls will go into Chelmsford, our police headquarters, once you cross over the borders and go into Metropolitan area, then that goes up to the Scotland Yard in their control rooms. Every telephone box has a unique telephone number, once you pick that up, it actually flashes a little signal, we can pinpoint exactly where you are. Now they're not the easiest things to speak into because the noise volume of the traffic is quite horrendous so you have to shout. Has anybody broken down here? Anybody been through this experience before? Yeah. Yeah. It's a horrible experience because the the through traffic goes so fast erm, so anybody who actually doesn't know quite what you have to do. On the marker posts that you see, the next time you, you travel past them at ninety miles an hour if you get time to see them, there is actually, a picture of the telephone headset and a number under that headset there will be an arrow pointing you in the direction of the nearest emergency telephone. If you get a post with two arrows it means you're exactly half way and you've gotta make the decision for yourselves. If you break down and you can drive to the nearest one, then do so, it i if it's something like a, your wheel, or your tyre's gone down, then drive. Yes, you're gonna damage your wheel, but you'll be safer that way. If you've got no choice but to get out and walk then you are gonna have to do that, and that's all very well being a day like today, where it's not pouring down with rain er, you're not walking in a pitch black area, but if you do suddenly change that and you put it into those sort of, well that sort of scenario you'll find it's very, very, frightening. What we have to say is, straight from Essex Police if that happens to you, get out, wherever possible on the passenger's side of the vehicle and then go to your nearest box and then you pick up the receiver and get through the police control room and they will ask you a series of questions, have you broken down? Are you a member of a national breakdown ? And are you a woman on your own? Cos women on their own, or with young children get priority. You know,. That all erm came about as a result of the Marie Rivers case Mm. And so we do try and give priority to, to ladies on their own. Given, obviously the fact that you've broken, and if you are a member of a breakdown organization they will call them out for you. If you are not, and I have to stress this very carefully then they will call the nearest available garage and the garage will come there very quickly and they will tow you off into the nearest exit and there they will leave you and that can cost you probably, in excess of ninety pounds. So it does pay you to be a member of R A C, National Breakdown, A A or whatever because at least most of them provide a service where they can take you to your destination and or arrange further transport for you. So, bear that in mind cos it wi , even if it's just sort of fifty yards up the motorway, that's where they'll drop you then you're on your own. Once you've made your call, they might ask you to stay by the phone erm, to to contact you back it might be that they ask you did you want anybody contacted to tell them that, that you've broken down, they will do that for you. You can ask them, if it's urgent, then they will do that. Then, we ask you return to the area of your car, but do not get back in because you run the risk of being injured erm, through cars ploughing into the back of you, far more than you, as much for a personal attack. So that is why, being a good boy scouts, and girl guides that you are you are gonna put things in the car so that you're, you are prepared for wet weather, or cold weather erm, such as an old blanket or something to sit on er, because we like you to sit upon a bank as far away from the traffic as possible Hello. Hello. Do have a seat, right what shall we do with you today? I seem to have done something silly with my shoulder, it's awfully stiff and Which one? This one. Right, but you can't think what? Well we were at a venture park on er Sunday and I reckon I probably did something on one of the rides without realizing it. No. Cos it came on sort of about middle of the day. Right, you haven't been from anything, or pulling anything too hard or? N other than carry my daughter, Mm. since she's a bit of lump nowadays. Now, you don't need to take anything off. Can you lift it up, right up? Yeah. Pretty good, can you get it behind your, get your hand behind your neck? Turn it ro er okay. Can y Can't feel it can you turn it round and get it behind your back? Can you put your hand behind your back like that? Turn it round. Good okay. Can you, can you actually do that? Can you swing it right round so you can do that? Y yeah I can. You're not allowed to use that one . Okay, good. Okay. So you've got a good range of movement, okay. Yes , yeah. What happens if you lift something or pull something? I get a sharp stabbing pain. If I'm br even Yeah. when I'm breathing, Yeah, I can feel it in my, in my Yeah,okay just relax. What I'm going to do is to examine now I'm going to go up the collar bone first over the shoulder pad,T-shirt with a shoulder pad . I know, they went out with the ark, didn't they? You okay over there? Yeah. Over the top? Good that's fine. Are you okay with the front of the joint, in there? Yeah. Yeah. It's only in articulate areas, I in the side of the joint there? Is that okay? It feels a bit tender, but Yeah. it's okay, yeah. Well yeah. Over the top? Yeah that's fine. Under there? Yeah. Now if I come round, just sit forward slightly for me, that's right. If I come round the shoulder blade muscles, round there. Anything? No. If I was to sort of pinch the muscle at the back here? If you can find it, that's huge muscle. Is that tender at all? No. Okay, can you point to where you get most discomfort? Right, in Oh. the centre there. Right in there? Oh okay. Mm. Is that tender to press in there? Oh yes. Yes. Is that hurting there? Yes. . That's fine. I'm . Now this isn't your s shoulder directly, but it is the muscles that hold and support and turn the shoulder blade, and of course whenever you do anything with your shoulder the shoulder blade moves with it. So it will tend to pull and it almost definitely is either reaching or pulling or holding something or holding on for your life, So I've just strained something? venture park. Yeah. It's Yeah. a muscle pull. But the trouble is with muscle pulls, they heal fairly slowly. They tend to get worse over a fe over a few days, before they start to get better as well. But it will improve, and the important thing is, pain relief if necessary, because you must keep your shoulder moving. If you keep your shoulder still, because it doesn't hurt so much, it'll tend to seize up like a rusty Mm. gate. Practise first thing in the morning. So ke that's right, so keep it moving, and the shoulder needs to be, to be able to go all the way up, all the way round, back you know, it's a very mobile joint. Yeah. But nothing serious though. Good. So I can write it's a lower full range of movement , mobilize. That's the important phrase, and if you find it's easier to keep it mobile if you've taken some paracetamol or aspirin, then by all means do that. Right. Would it be possible to find out what Priscilla's results were because she's had a urine test and she's extremely sore and they've asked for another urine test, and I'm That's right. a little bit concerned. Wh we hav we haven't grown any bugs, but we have found red blood cells and er white blood cells there which are the sort of blood cells you get in wee if there's been informatio inflammation or infection round. So it points towards an infection but it doesn't prove it. Waterworks infections in kids are actually very very important to identify because they all need investigating. Right. Is there anything else that I can do for her cos she says she is in quite a lot of discomfort at the moment. Stacks and stacks to drink. The more dilute the urine, the less it'll irritate, sting and burn. And it'll tend to flush things through. But we must have another sample, and we we Yeah. don't want the first wee of the mor We don't want the first one in the morning. Ah. Any, any other one. So let her empty her bladder after it's been sitting there overnight, and then a nice fresh sample. As long as it gets here before Ah right. half ten. The first one in the morning often has all sorts of rubbish in. It tends to be rather concentrated and isn't really the one we want. That's probably why we had trouble last time. Well maybe, yes. Okay have you got a fresh bottle? I have yes, Okay. That's that. Right, okay, thank you very much. Not at all, we'll see what happens with her, but the sooner we get that the sooner we can take things on if we need to. Lovely Okay? Thank you very much for your help. Not at all. If you have further problems, pop back. Right, thanks. See you. Bye. Hello Dorothy. The s it isn't Dorothy, it's me. Oh sorry Joan, I'm sorry. I do apologize, won. *ADU: let us race again.

Afterward a whirling brush cleans the saws of the fiber clinging to them. It is an effectual system but a merciless one and is best adapted to short staple cotton which is strong and does not snarl. The best gins use only long, smooth blades to clear the cotton and it follows that these do the fiber far less injury." "How does a ginning factory look, Uncle Frederick?" Carl inquired. "You mean the inside? I never went through but one. I was waiting for a cargo at Norfolk once and as there happened to be a ginning plant near where I was staying I visited it. Generally peaking I suppose they are pretty much alike. The cotton is brought to them, as I said, in clearly marked, or branded bags or baskets, and is tossed from the wagons directly into hoppers. Afterward the contents of the hoppers is loaded into freight elevators and shot to one of the upper stories of the factory, there to be piled up and await its turn for ginning. "When the time comes to gin that particular batch it is heaped into a hopper and borne to the gins below by means of traveling racks." "How many gins are there to a factory?" questioned Mary. "That depends on the size of the factory and the amount of work brought there to be done," was the reply. "A fair-sized factory in a busy district will have half-a-dozen gins or more; and when you know that one gin will clean from three hundred to three hundred and fifty pounds of cotton an hour you will see that it will take a pretty big supply to keep such a lot of machinery moving. There is a separate hopper for each gin and if the supply fed into it comes too fast it can be stopped and switched to other gins. Once in the clutch of the relentless knives the cotton is shredded apart and the seeds drop out and fall into a traveling basket. From this basket they are forced through a tube to an oil mill which usually stands in another part of the grounds." "Cottonseed oil!" murmured Mary, recognizing an old friend. "We often use it to fry things. It's good on lettuce, too. But somehow I never thought that it was really made from the seeds of cotton." "We often accept terms without thinking much about them, don't we?" Captain Dillingham agreed. "But cottonseed oil is a genuine by-product of cotton." "What is a by-product?" smiled Mary ingenuously. "A by-product is something made from the leavings," put in Carl without hesitation. "Hash is a by-product of corned beef." A laugh greeted the assertion. "Technically speaking a by-product is something that is turned to account from what would otherwise have been waste. Every person who manufactures on a large scale tries to think what he can do with what is left after he has made the thing he started out to make. This he does for two reasons: first he wishes to turn back into money every ounce of material for which he has paid; secondly he desires to get rid of stuff which would otherwise accumulate and (if not combustible) force him into the added expense of carting it away. In other words he seeks to convert his waste into an asset instead of a liability. Therefore all big producers tax their brains to invent things that can be made from their waste, and such commodities are called by-products. Many of these things require no ingenuity for frequently they are articles much needed in other trades. Masons, for example, are only too thankful to have the hair taken from tanned leather to hold their plaster together; and those who dry and salt fish can easily turn the fish skins into glue. The by-products of great packing houses and tanneries are legion. Often such dealers will have at hand such a supply of usable stuff that they will establish other factories where their unused materials can be converted into cash. The sale of these products often increases very materially the profits of a business. Such a product is cottonseed oil. As millions more seeds mature each year than can possibly be used for planting why not turn them to account? Often there are from sixty-five to seventy-five pounds of seeds to a hundred pounds of cotton. Think how rapidly they would accumulate if something could not be done with them. During the war when we were unable to get olive oil from Italy and fats of all kinds were scarce we were thankful enough to fall back on the cottonseed oil made in our own country. At the oil mills machines are ready to clean the cotton seeds of lint, hull them, separate hull from kernel, and press the oil from the kernel itself. This oil is then bottled, labelled, and shipped for sale, making quite an independent little industry, you see. What is left of the crushed kernels is removed from the hydraulic presses and is remolded into small cakes to be used for----" he paused, glancing quizzically toward Carl and Mary. "For what?" the boy asked. "Guess!" "I've not the most remote idea," Carl returned. "Nor I!" echoed Mary. "For cattle to eat," went on Captain Dillingham, completing his unfinished sentence. "Even the hulls," he continued, "are, I believe, utilized in some way; and as I previously told you the lint which clings to the seeds is passed through a second sort of gin, gathered into a bundle, and afterward put through a carding engine which combs it out and prepares it so it can be made into wadding for coverlids, quilted linings, and quilted petticoats. All the gins then collect whatever material is left and this, being absolutely too poor for any other purpose, is sold as cotton waste to be used for cleaning machinery and polishing brass and nickel trimmings. Were we individuals half as thrifty as are manufacturers in salvaging the odds and ends that come our way we might save ourselves many a penny. Every year we Americans throw away enough food and wearing apparel to maintain a small army. We are, alas, a very wasteful people and are constantly becoming more so. Our ancestors used to lay aside buttons, string, papers, scraps of cloth and use them again. They made over clothing, fashioned rag rugs, conserved everything they could lay hands on. Their attics were museums where were horded every sort of object against the time when it might be needed. But do we follow their example? No, indeed! In fact, we go to the other extreme and hurry out of the house, either to a junk dealer or a rummage sale, everything we cannot find immediate use for. To a certain extent our mode of living has forced us to this course. Most of us reside in cramped city quarters where there are no spacious attics in which to garner up articles against a rainy day. Modern apartment dwellers boast neither attic nor cellar, to say nothing of a farmer's barn loft. Moreover, we all must scramble so fast to earn our daily bread that we have no time to make over the old; it is cheaper, we reason, to purchase new than to fuss with remodelling. Neither are materials what they were in the old days. Few of the fine old silks and woolens that would wear for a generation are to be had at present. Also we have more money than our forebears and this has much to do with our wholesale wastefulness. With plenty of everything at hand, why save? And the policy the individual is following on a small scale the nation is adopting on a much vaster one. We are using up our forests, our mines, all our resources with no thought of the morrow. We ought to stop and think about this before it is too late but I doubt if we ever will." Captain Dillingham paused. "There is such a thing," he added, "as people and nations being too prosperous for their own good. But to return to the cotton gin. The cotton, having been cleared of its seeds, is now known as lint, and this is bundled together until enough of it is collected to be properly baled for the spinning mills." "What is _proper baling_?" inquired Carl. "Why, the rough baling simply gathers the cotton together into a big bundle." "Well, what's the matter with that?" "Nothing--so far as it goes," laughed the Captain. "I should be sorry, however, to see many such bales coming aboard my ship." "Why?" "Well, you know what cotton is," answered Uncle Frederick. "After it has been picked to pieces in the gins it comes out a nice, white, fluffy mass that takes up no end of room. Were it to be transported in this condition a few hundred pounds of it would fill a ship or freight car and cost the owner so much that it would not be worth his while to transport it. Moreover, it would be bothersome to handle when it arrived at the spinning mills. Therefore before cotton is shipped it has to be reduced in bulk so that it will not take up so much space." "But how can it be, Uncle Frederick? asked Mary, open-eyed. "What do you do when you wish to make some soft material into a small parcel, my dear?" "Oh, roll it up--squeeze it together," was the instant response. "Well, there you have your answer!" responded Uncle Frederick. "Balers treat cotton lint in the same fashion; only, as they are not strong enough to accomplish this end with their hands, they resort to powerful machines, or compressors, to carry out the process for them. By means of enormous pressure they crush down the billowing lint until four feet of it can be reduced to a thickness of not more than seven inches." "I wouldn't want to fall into that machine! chuckled Carl. "There wouldn't be much left of you if you should, I can assure you of that," Captain Dillingham said. "Cotton, however, does not raise any such protest. It is pressed and pressed and pressed, and while still in the presses iron bands are put round it to hold it so it can be compactly transported. An American bale of some five hundred pounds will usually have six or seven of these iron bands round it. Certain of these bales are merely rough ones; others are cylindrical. I believe the latter sort are more generally preferred. To make them the cotton is gradually pressed and rolled by powerful presses until a bale four feet long and about two feet through is obtained. These cylindrical bales weigh a trifle less than the others--about four hundred and twenty-six pounds--and because they have been pressed so hard they keep in place without either iron bands or cloth covers. When they arrive at the mills the cotton from them can be unrolled and much more easily fed into the machines. If they are covered it is merely to keep them clean." "Do all bales of cotton have to weigh the same?" inquired Carl. "You mean is there a standardized weight for all bales?" "Yes." "No, there is no universal standard for bales of cotton. The bales from different countries differ quite considerably. For example a Brazilian bale usually weighs only from a hundred and seventy-five to two hundred and twenty pounds; the Turkish from two hundred and fifty to three hundred and twenty-five pounds; those coming from India do better, averaging about three hundred and ninety pounds. Should you handle this imported cotton you would notice that the bales from India are very heavily banded, often as many as thirteen bands encircling them. This is partly because the long staple of this variety of cotton must not be injured by heavy pressure, and partly because they have not in India the excellent facilities for compressing lint that we have here. The Egyptian bales are the largest transported; they run as high as seven hundred pounds and have about eleven bands to hold them." "It must be a stunt to get them aboard ship," grinned Carl. "I've taken my turn at the job," responded the captain drily. "We swing them down into the hold by means of cranes and have now learned to land them quite neatly. Nevertheless, even though they are only bundles of cotton wool I should not fancy having one of them drop on my head," concluded he with a twinkle. CHAPTER XI A FAMILY CONGRESS Meantime while the McGregors discussed cotton and the sunny southern fields in which it grew, Christmas was approaching and Baileyville, shrouded in wintry whiteness, began to feel the pulse of the coming holiday. Shop windows along the main street were gay with holly and scarlet. Every alluring object was displayed to entice purchasers and such objects as were not alluring were made to appear so by a garnish of ribbon or flashing tinsel. There were Christmas carpet sweepers, Christmas teakettles, Christmas coal hods and how surprised and embarrassed they must have been to find themselves dragged out of their modest corners and, arrayed in splendor, set forth before the public gaze. Nothing was too mundane to be transformed by the holiday's magic into a thing mystic and unreal. Even such a prosaic article as a washtub, borrowing luster from the season's witchery and in shining blue dress became a thing to covet and dream about. Then there was the army of foolish trifles that owed their existence merely to the season's glamor and would have had no excuse for being at a time when the purchaser's head was level and his judgment sane. And in addition to all these there were the scores upon scores of gifts useful, fascinating, desirable, but beyond range of possibility at any ordinary period of the year. Oh, it was a time to keep one's balance, the Christmas holidays! The very stones of the streets glistened golden and the crisp air breathed enchantment. If one's nerves were not frayed and on edge he jostled his neighbor with a smile and took his share of jostling in good part. Was not every man a brother; and did not a great throbbing kindliness emanate from all humanity? It seemed so to Carl McGregor as the wonderful day of days drew near; and so also it seemed to all the wee McGregors. They were on tiptoe with excitement and could hardly be made to stand still long enough to have their neckties tied or their pinafores buttoned. "Have you children decided yet what you want to do?" questioned their mother one morning, as she struggled to hold the wriggling Tim until his hair could be made presentable for school. "Christmas is but a week away now and we must come to some decision as to our plans. We can't have everything, you know. Shall it be a turkey and no tree? Or shall it be a tree and no turkey? And if it is a tree shall it be a big or a little one? We must vote on all these questions." "I want ice-teem," lisped Nell. "Mercy on us!" ejaculated Mrs. McGregor, in consternation, as this fresh avenue for outlay presented itself. "Nell is for ice cream and a tree too." "And turkey!" went on the little one imperturbably. "Me wants turkey!" "Ice-treem! Ice-treem!" cooed James Frederick. The mother's face clouded. A tree, turkey, ice cream and presents were far beyond the range of the family purse. "I'd rather have stockings and turkey," Mary declared. "And cranberry sauce and nuts," put in Tim. "And celery and sweet potatoes," added Carl. "A real dinner, Mother." "Would you rather do that than have the tree?" Silence greeted the question. Into every mind flashed the picture of a tree towering to the ceiling and a-glitter with lights and ornaments. Even Carl, despite his fourteen years, could not entirely banish the vision. But the dinner, the dinner! After all the tree would only be a thing to look at; food could be eaten and enjoyed, and Carl was a healthy boy at an age when he was possessed of a particularly healthy appetite. Tempting as was the tree the aroma of browned turkey rose in his nostrils. "I vote for turkey," announced he at last. "No tree? No Christmas tree?" murmured Martin, his lip quivering. "You have a tree at kindergarten, silly, and so does Nell," declared the elder brother quickly. "'Tain't like having it here--our really own tree," bewailed Martin. "Couldn't we have a simpler dinner, Mother, and manage to get a tree?" interrogated Mary. "It is fun to trim it and the little children love it so." "Girls always like things that look pretty," piped Tim in disdain. "And all boys care about is to eat and eat," Mary shot out with equal scorn. Hidden away in a corner behind his newspaper Captain Dillingham chuckled. He was vastly amused by this family congress. Meantime Mrs. McGregor, in order to avert the battle she saw rising, said, "Suppose we put it to vote. Are you ready for the question?" "Yes!" responded her flock in chorus. "All right. Shall it be presents and turkey, or presents and a tree?" "I want mince pie," proclaimed Martin flatly. "But we are not talking of pie, dear," answered his mother patiently. "It is the turkey we're voting on." "I want turkey _and_ a tree _and_ presents _and_ ice-teem _and_ pie!" Nell asserted shamelessly. "Stockings and turkey, Ma! Stockings and turkey!" shouted Carl. "Listen, dears!" began their mother. "As I told you before we can't have everything. I wish we could but we just plain can't, so that ends it. Therefore we must choose what we think we will get the most pleasure out of. Now who is for turkey? Raise your hands!" Every hand came up. "And who is for a tree?" Again every hand was raised. Helplessly Mrs. McGregor sank back into her chair. "Oh, dear," sighed she. "Don't you see we are getting nowhere? I told you only a minute ago we couldn't have both." Uncle Frederick came out from behind his paper. "See here, you young savages," began he, laughing good-humoredly, "listen to me! If you do not get down to business and use some sense, Christmas will be here and you will have nothing at all." A wail ascended from Nell and Martin. "Your mother can give you either turkey or a tree; but she can't give you both. In my opinion she is almighty good to do so much." He saw the children flush uncomfortably. Carl dropped his eyes and Mary slipped a hand into her mother's. "Now instead of clamoring at her like a lot of ungrateful little brutes and wanting the whole earth, why don't you show her you are grateful for what she's doing?" went on Captain Dillingham in a sharper tone. "Oh, it's all right, Frederick," interrupted Mrs. McGregor hurriedly. "I don't want----" The captain, however, was not to be stopped. "Your mother is ready to give you turkey _or_ a tree. How many are for turkey?" Carl and Tim raised their hands. "And who is for the tree?" Instantly Mary, Martin, and Nell raised their hands. "It is the tree, as I see it," acclaimed he. "But it isn't fair," Tim objected. "James Frederick didn't vote." At this everybody laughed and whatever tension there was vanished. "Oh, James Frederick would vote for the tree," Mary said. "He is so little he couldn't eat turkey if we had it, could he, Mother?" "I'm afraid he couldn't," smiled her mother. "He hasn't teeth enough." "Then it is a tree! A tree!" cried Martin exultantly. "Wait!" Captain Dillingham put up his hand. "We haven't finished with this matter yet. You've got your tree from your mother; now I can give you a turkey if you decide you want me to. But first you are to listen to what I have to say. A Christmas tree and a turkey mean a great deal for one family to have in these days when so many people are having so little. The O'Dowds, for example, are to have neither a Christmas dinner nor a tree; I happen to know that. Joey has been sick and there are doctor's bills to pay. Beside that, Mr. O'Dowd has been out of work and has no money to spend this year." The little McGregors regarded their uncle with solemn faces. "Oh, dear!" breathed Mary sympathetically. Carl scowled soberly; then his face glowed with a sudden idea. "Couldn't we----" he hesitated awkwardly. "Oh, Uncle Frederick, if you _were_ really going to buy a turkey, couldn't we give it to them?" flashed Mary, smiling toward her brother. "Would you mind giving it away to somebody else? You see, if you were going to buy it anyway----" she regarded her uncle timidly, "we could have something else for dinner, couldn't we, Mother? Perhaps corn chowder. We all like that. And maybe we could have a pudding and some nuts." "Bully, Mary! I'm with you!" Carl rejoined. "I'd like to do that, too," agreed Martin. "I wouldn't mind so much about the turkey if we had the tree." "What do you say, Tim?" inquired Captain Dillingham. "I don't see why we should give our turkey to somebody else," grumbled Tim sullenly. "We never have one all the year--never! You know we don't, Mother." "No, dear; I'm afraid we don't," Mrs. McGregor said. "Then why should we give ours away," went on Tim in an argumentative tone. "Don't we want turkey as much as the O'Dowds, I'd like to know?" "Oh, Timmie!" "Don't be such a pig, Tim," cut in Carl with brotherly directness. "If we were hard up, wouldn't you like somebody to send you something for Christmas?" Tim colored, his brother's question bringing home to him uncomfortable possibilities. "We could have such fun doing it, Timmie," coaxed Mary. "Think how we could trim up the basket, and what a surprise it would be! Why, it would make no end of sport." Tim's expression softened. Instantly Mrs. McGregor, who was quick to interpret her children's moods, saw the battle was won. "We can plan together what shall go into the basket," said she briskly. "Each of us might contribute the thing he likes best." "The turkey shall be mine!" Uncle Frederick declared. "I choose cranberry sauce!" Carl announced. "Celery! Oh, could I put in celery, Mother?" Mary inquired. "The tops are so pretty and I love it so!" Her mother nodded. "Somebody must give the plain things so I will donate potatoes, squash, and onions," she said. "Don't forget nuts! We must have nuts and raisins," Mary added. "I'd like to give those," Tim whispered. "You shall, son." A friendly little glance passed between the boy and his mother. "Pie! I want pie!" asserted Nell, who although too young to understand what was going on, nevertheless grasped the notion that food was the prevailing topic and plunged into the subject with enthusiasm. "Bless your heart, dearie, you shall have pie!" laughed her mother. "I'll make a couple of apple pies and they shall be your present." "There ought to be candy. Please let me send candy! May I?" begged Martin for whom the world held only two articles really worth while--candy and ice cream. There was general merriment at this suggestion. "Precious little candy would ever get to anybody else if you had the giving of it, Martie," teased Mary. "Yes, Martin shall give the candy," Mrs. McGregor consented. "We'll paste his mouth up before he goes to buy it," Carl drawled. "Don't you s'pose I could keep from eating it if once I set out to?" scowled Martin defiantly. "No, I don't!" "Well, I could, so now!" The boy drew himself up proudly. "James Frederick ought to send something, Mother," reminded the care-taking Mary. "We don't want him left out." "Oh, we mustn't leave out the baby!" agreed Captain Dillingham. "He and I will get together and talk the matter over. There are still several things needed." "Oh, it will be splendid!" cried Mary, clapping her hands. "Do get a real big turkey, won't you, Uncle Frederick? And we'll trim it up with a necklace of cranberries the way they do in the market." "Huh! There you go again," sniffed Tim. "All girls seem to think of is necklaces and bows of ribbon." Mary smiled brightly. "What's the harm in making it pretty if you can just as well?" asked she. "I do love pretty things. Why, I believe I could eat stewed whale if it was on a pretty dish." "I couldn't; I'd hate whale," responded the stolid Timothy. "Oh, I didn't mean I'd really eat whale, silly," explained Mary. "Then what did you say you would for?" "Mary was just imagining, dear," put in Mrs. McGregor, coming to the rescue. "She is always imagining," glowered Tim. "Only the other day she was trying to make me imagine my salt fish was chicken." "I'll bet she didn't succeed," taunted Carl. "Not on your life she didn't!" was the instant answer. "I know salt fish when I see it." "No matter, dear," soothed Mrs. McGregor, affectionately touching her daughter's arm. "If her imagining Mary can convert salt fish into chicken it is an asset that will stand her in good stead all through life. And if you, Tim, prefer to keep your salt fish just salt fish, why you have a perfect right to do so. I will say, however, that the person who has the power to make believe has an invaluable gift. Many's the time I've made believe and it has helped me over more than one hard spot. We all have to masquerade to a greater or less degree. It is simply meeting life with imagination and seeing in the humdrum something that associates it with finer and more beautiful things." For a moment she was silent; then she added in her quick, businesslike accents, "And now to this dinner! There must be a basket to hold it, of course." "A big market basket, Mother, lined with red paper. Do line it with red," pleaded Mary. "It shall be lined with red, little lady! And trimmed with holly, too!" replied Uncle Frederick. "I will undertake to furnish both decorations along with the turkey." "Why not put in Santa Claus napkins? I saw some paper ones the other day and they were tremendously festive," suggested Mrs. McGregor. "I think the best plan is for us all to go together and buy the dinner," the Captain suddenly announced. Shouts of approval greeted the plan. "But the baby!" demurred his sister. "We can wheel James Frederick in the carriage and take turns staying outside the shops with him," said Carl. "And if we have the carriage we can bring home our stuff in it," put in Tim. "Poor baby! How would you like to have a big ten-pound turkey piled on top of you?" questioned Mary indignantly. "Oh, James Frederick won't mind," Tim responded comfortably. "And anyhow, he's got to do his bit toward making other people happy. As far as I can see he isn't denying himself anything, for he couldn't eat a turkey if it was set right under his nose. So it's his part to tote home the parcels in his flivver; he seems to be the only member of the family that has one." Thus it was agreed and on the day before Christmas it would have done one good to witness the cavalcade of McGregors issuing forth on their altruistic pilgrimage. First went Mary, leading Nell by the hand; then Carl with Martin's mitten firmly clutched in his. Next came Mrs. McGregor with Tim, and bringing up at the rear was Uncle Frederick wheeling his namesake, the baby. What a tour it was! Certainly there never had been such a turkey as the one the reckless captain bought--a turkey so plump of breast, so white of skin, so golden of claw! Why, it was a king of birds! And then the shining coral of the cranberries, the satin gleam of the onions, the warm brown of the potatoes! As for the celery--its delicate green and faint canary tips were as good as a bouquet of flowers. Just to view its crispness was to make the mouth water. And the nuts, raisins, candy, oranges! Once in their vicinity Captain Dillingham cast aside all caution and wildly purchased one dainty after another. He seemed to have gone quite mad and it was not until his sister very positively informed him that not another bundle could be carried that he consented to be dragged away from the counters of sweet-meats. Then staggering beneath their load of whity-brown parcels, the family hastened out to the baby carriage where Mary stood guarding James Frederick. "Put the turkey down near his feet," cried she excitedly, as she lifted the baby in order to make more room. "The other things can be packed in round him." "But he'll be stifled!" objected Mrs. McGregor. "Oh, no, he won't, Ma!" contradicted Tim. "He'll probably be uncomfortable. Christmas comes but once a year, though, so he ought to be able to survive being cramped." "Oh, James Frederick is perfectly used to having his coupé turned into an express wagon, Mother," Carl explained. "Don't worry about him. Often he rides home from down-town buried a foot deep in bundles. All that fusses me is whether the carriage will stand the strain. If it should part in the middle and the front wheels go off on an independent route it would be----" "Both inconvenient and embarrassing," concluded Captain Dillingham with a laugh. Fortunately, however, James Frederick's chariot was staunchly constructed and reached Mulberry Court without mishap, its precious contents--including the patient owner of the vehicle--being borne triumphantly aloft to the McGregor flat. Once upstairs the basket, scarlet paper, and holly were produced, and Mary with deft fingers went to work to fashion a receptacle worthy of the bounties with which the O'Dowds were to be surprised. At last into this garish hamper were packed the viands and afterward a card bearing holiday greetings was tied to the handle with a flaring red bow. "Now the worst task is to come," declared Mrs. McGregor, "and that is to land the present at Julie's door without being caught. They are proud people, the O'Dowds, and I wouldn't for worlds have them know from whom the dinner comes. Timmie is not strong enough to take it and Carl is too clumsy. Should he start to run away, like as not he would stumble and bring all Mulberry Court to see what the racket was." "Why can't I carry it?" inquired Captain Dillingham. "You! One sight of your gold buttons would be enough, Frederick. Besides, you're none too agile in making a getaway." "I fancy some boy could be found to leave it if I paid him," suggested the captain. "The very thing! There's a score of 'em on the street. Fetch in the fastest runner you see, Timmie. No matter whether you know him or not. In fact, get one you don't know. 'Twill be all the better." Away sped Tim only to return an instant later with a grimy, Italian youngster at his heels. Captain Dillingham explained the errand. At the sight of the gleaming quarter of a dollar the Italian grinned. He would leave a bomb or a live ox at anybody's door for a quarter, affirmed he with an ingratiating smile. Therefore the precious basket was entrusted to him and to judge by the scampering that followed its thud before the O'Dowds' door he was quite as fleet of foot as Tim had asserted. "Wouldn't you like to see their faces when they find it?" whispered Carl who, with Mary, was hanging over the banister, straining his ears for every sound. There was not, however, much to hear. After the furious knock somebody ventured into the hall. Then Julie's voice, high-pitched with excitement and consternation, exclaimed, "Mercy on us!" With that she dragged the basket into her abode and banged the door. It was a brief drama but one entirely satisfying to the McGregors. Over and over again did Carl and Mary enact the scene to the intense delight of the family. "Now mind, should Mrs. O'Dowd come up here with questions, you are to be careful what you say," cautioned their mother. "There's to be no hinting, winking, or smirking. Should Julie say anything, leave it to your uncle or me to answer. All the fun would be spoiled if you gave the secret away." "Oh, yes," agreed Carl. "The sport is to keep folks guessing." But no sooner were the words out of his mouth is than there was a rapping at the hall door. "Oh, Ma! I'll bet that is Mrs. O'Dowd now!" gasped Mary. "It can't be! She'd not track us down so quick as this," replied Mrs. McGregor, flustered and half rising. "Most likely it's the Christmas tree, Mother," Tim suggested. "They promised to send it early this afternoon." Again came the knock. "I'm half afraid to open the door lest it be Julie," faltered Mrs. McGregor. "Be still a minute, all of you, till I think what I'll say to her." But when, amid a tense hush, the door was finally opened, neither Julie O'Dowd nor the watched-for Christmas tree was on the threshold. Instead they saw a holly-decked basket so exactly a replica of the one they had given away that a cry of disappointment greeted it. "She's sent it back!" cried Mary. [Illustration: "But that isn't our basket, Mother," Carl said. "This is much bigger." _Page_ 155.] "She was offended and wouldn't take it!" murmured Mrs. McGregor. "I feared as much." "But that isn't our basket, Mother," Carl said. "This is much bigger. Besides, we had no apples or candy bags in the one we sent." Critically studying the gift, the family clustered around. "It isn't our basket, Mother," Mary presently asserted. "See, this one is red." "There must be some mistake, then," Mrs. McGregor declared. "They've left it at the wrong place." "But our name is on it!" cried Tim. "Where? Where?" What a bumping of heads there was as everybody bent to read the card. "Yes, our name is on it plain as day!" replied Mrs. McGregor with a puzzled expression. Then, inspired by a solution of the mystery, she wheeled round on her brother. "How much do you know about this, Frederick?" "Not a thing, Nellie--I give you my word! Dearly as I should have liked to send you such a gift, my purse wasn't quite good for it," flushed the captain. "And what wonder, with all you've spent this day," returned his sister quickly. "Then we'll count you out. But where could it have come from?" "We don't need to leave it in the hall until we find out, do we, Mother?" Mary ventured mischievously. "No, I suppose we don't," was the retort. "Timmie, you and Carl drag it indoors. Don't try to lift it, for you'll only be straining yourselves and maybe drop it. Let's get it into the kitchen. There may be some clue when we have a better light." But examine it as they would, no hint as to the mysterious sender could be found. "I guess he believes with Carl that the sport of giving a present is to keep the other person guessing," Tim remarked wickedly. A general laugh at Carl's expense greeted the observation. "Hush!" cautioned Mrs. McGregor. "There's somebody in the hall." "He won't get away this time," Carl cried, springing up and throwing open the door. "Good heavens, man! You nearly knocked me down!" cried Hal Harling, amazed by the suddenness of his welcome. "What's the matter with you? Trying to trap a burglar?" Then, glancing at the object about which the household were clustering, he added, "Jove! Have you got one, too?" "What do you mean?" "Why, just now somebody left a basket exactly like this at our flat. I thought maybe you folks had something to do with it and came straight over here to see. But you seem to be favored by a similar gift. They are alike as two peas. Who sent them?" "That is precisely what we want to know," Carl replied. "You've no idea?" "Not the most remote." "Hasn't Captain Dillingham?" "I'm not guilty, if that is what you mean," the sea captain answered. "Straight goods?" Hal insisted. "Hang, die, and choke to death!" laughed the little old man. "But--but--somebody sent the thing!" blustered Hal. "Why, there is everything on earth in it. Food enough to last a week. And ours has a shawl for my mother and some felt slippers for my grandfather in the bottom. And there are gloves for Louise and me. It came from somebody who knew all about us. It was no haphazard present." "Can you beat it!" murmured Carl. "Whoever do you suppose----" "I can't suppose. We thought it was you," announced Hal. "There's a knock at the door. Shall I go?" Leaping forward he turned the knob, and in came Mrs. O'Dowd. "I've had the most wonderful basket sent me that ever----" began she; then her eye fell upon the hamper in the center of the floor. "Glory be to goodness!" she ejaculated. "Wherever did you get that?" "We don't know," Carl answered. "And we've one just like it and can't find out who sent us ours," put in Hal Harling. "Well, I thought for sure as you were the folks that sent me mine," declared Julie. "But if they are being scattered broadcast and you are getting one yourselves I reckon it is safe to say you don't know much about where mine came from. Well, all I can say is may the sender of them have a blessed Christmas. Owing to O'Dowd being out of work, we were to have a pretty slim celebration this year. The children were like to get nothing at all. And then just when I was trying to comfort myself with thinking how glad I should be that Joey was well, and that we all had our health even if we did lack a turkey and the fixings, along comes this windfall. Why, it is as if the heavens opened and dropped it straight down at our door. It does you good to know there are kind hearts in the world, doesn't it?" One and all the McGregors smiled. If they wanted thanks for the self-denial they had practised they certainly had them in the gratitude that beamed from Julie's face. "Well, it will be a royal Christmas for all of us, won't it?" went on the little woman, bustling out. "I must hurry back downstairs. The children are that crazy they are like to eat the turkey raw, claws, neck and feathers!" "I'll come with you, Mrs. O'Dowd," said Hal. "Good-by, and a Merry Christmas, everybody." "I'm mighty glad we sent that dinner to the O'Dowd's!" commented Carl soberly, when the door was shut and the McGregors were alone. "I'd be glad we did it even if we had no dinner of our own," he added, his eyes alight with a grave happiness. "And I, too," whispered Tim. CHAPTER XII A CLUE The next morning, fluttering excitedly round a Christmas tree spangled with tinsel and aglow with lights, the McGregors received their presents; and not they alone, for Julie O'Dowd, with her five youngsters, swelled the party, together with the Murphys and the Sullivans from the floors below. There was popcorn for everybody and satiny striped candy, and from the mysterious basket an orange for each guest was produced. "When we have so much ourselves it would be wrong to keep it all," Mrs. McGregor had asserted; and her household fully agreed with her. Therefore the neighbors were summoned in to share in the festivity. And after the visitors had trailed down the long stairway, shouting back their pleasure and gratitude, the wonderful dinner the hamper contained was prepared, and what a delightful ceremonial that was! Did ever any such tantalizing aroma drift upon the air as ascended from the browning turkey? Or did ever potatoes so fill their jackets to bursting? As for the celery--it was like ivory; and the cranberry jelly as transparent and glowing as a huge ruby. And, oh, the browning crust of the mince pies! So many hungry little McGregors swarmed round the stove it was a marvel some of them were not burned to death on hot stove covers or the oven door. One could scarcely baste the turkey without falling over two or three of them. However, nobody was scalded or blistered and when at length the great bronzed bird was borne from the oven a procession of exultant children followed in the wake of the huge platter, every one of them shouting for the wishbone or a drumstick. "Was the creature a centipede he would hardly have drumsticks to satisfy you!" laughed their mother. "Who ever saw such a lot of cannibals! Was anybody to hear your hubbub they'd think you had never had a mouthful to eat in all your lives. I don't believe your uncle ever saw worse heathen in the South Sea Islands." Nevertheless, in spite of her caustic comment, it was plain that the mother was enjoying her children's pleasure and that Uncle Frederick was enjoying it too. "Well," went on Mrs. McGregor, "if you do not get filled up to-day it will be your own fault. I shall put no check on anybody. You may eat all you'll hold." Profiting by this spacious permission the McGregors fell to and what a feast they had! Never had they dreamed of such a meal. Even Carl and Martin, whose capacity appeared to be limitless, were at length forced to confess that for once in their lives they had had enough; as for Tim he sank back in his chair almost in tears because he could not find room for another mouthful. "I couldn't squeeze down a single 'nother thing if I was paid for it," wailed he. "And I did so want a second helping of pudding! Why didn't you stop me, Ma, when I started out on that giant sweet potato?" His mother shrugged her shoulders. "You must learn to make your own choices," said she. "Perhaps 'twill teach you next time not to covet all you see. And now, before we begin to clear up, I want to make sure you are all content. There must be no regrets. I don't want to hear to-morrow that you wish you had had so-and-so. So think well before the food is whisked into the pantry. Has everybody had enough?" A chorus of muffled groans arose. "What do you think we are, Ma?" Tim managed to murmur. "Indeed I don't know," was the grim retort. "I've often wondered. So you think you couldn't eat a morsel more?" "_Think!_ We know we couldn't," gasped Carl. "Then sit still a second, all of you, till I take a good look at you!" commanded their mother. "That I should live to see the day when I would dish up a meal without some amongst you yammering for another helping! I'm almost tempted to take an affidavit with your signatures in black and white and preserve it in the family Bible." With arms akimbo she viewed her grinning flock. "Well, since you're beyond urging, we may as well turn to the dishes--that is, if anybody can stagger up and help." Reaching over she began to remove the food from the table. Mary sprang to aid her. "Let me carry the things into the pantry," Tim said. "Maybe if I walk round some it will shake down what I've eaten." "Are you laying to eat another course?" derided Carl. "Aw, quit it!" growled Tim. "I'll bet I haven't made way with any more than you have. Here, fork over that pie! I'll put it in the closet." "Can we trust you with it?" called Captain Dillingham. Tim put up his hand. "Say, I wouldn't touch that pie if you were to go down on your knees and beg me to," Tim declared. "Millions wouldn't hire me!" "Give it to him, Carl; he sounds perfectly safe," asserted the lad's mother. "And put those apples and figs away, too, dear, if you are going into the pantry. Mary, you and Carl pile the dishes. What an army of them there are! I believe we have out every plate we own. Martin, do take the babies into the next room where they will be out from under foot. And watch that Nell doesn't eat the candles off the tree. She's always thinking they are candy, the witch!" "You must let me help," urged Uncle Frederick, rolling up his sleeves. "Oh, you must not work to-day, Frederick," his sister protested. "It is a holiday and you are on shore leave. Besides, it never seems right to me to see the captain of a ship working." "Oh, the captain of a ship knows the galley quite as well as the bridge," responded Uncle Frederick. Seizing a towel he stationed himself beside Mary who was elbow deep in the dishpan. "All hands to the pumps!" cried he sharply. It was a ringing command and instantly Tim and Carl leaped forward to obey it. What a dish-wiping team the three made! Mary could scarcely wash fast enough to keep up with them. In the meantime Mrs. McGregor was here, there, and everywhere, putting to rights the disordered house; and so effectual was her touch that by the time the last plate was on the shelf tranquillity reigned and except for lurking candy bags and stray bits of red ribbon it almost seemed as if there had never been such an event as a Christmas party. "Now why can't we all go over to the Harlings, Ma?" Carl inquired. "They will be through their dinner by this time. Hal asked if we couldn't come." "But not all of us!" objected Mrs. McGregor. "Why, we're a caravan!" "Nobody minds caravans on Christmas," pleaded Carl. "Grandfather Harling would love to see the children. We haven't had them there for ever so long." "I suppose we might go. It isn't very far," his mother meditated. "Oh, do let's!" Tim put in. "I'll wheel James Frederick." "You? You couldn't wheel anything, so full are you of turkey and plum pudding! If you get there yourself you will be doing well," was the curt retort. "However, if you all want to go, I'll not hinder you. Scurry and get your caps, coats, and mittens." Off flew the youngsters in every direction; off, too, flew Mrs. McGregor with Nell and Martin at her heels and the baby in her arms. Owing to excitement and the general holiday confusion it was some time before there were two rubbers, two mittens, a cap, coat, and muffler for everybody; on the very brink of departure a full equipment for Martin could not be found and to his unbounded delight he was compelled to set forth in one arctic and one rubber boot--a novel combination that greatly heightened his pleasure in the trip and made him the envy of all his younger brothers and sisters. Whether his satisfaction would have outlived a long journey is uncertain for the rubber boot proved to be not only too large but treacherously leaky. Notwithstanding the fact, however, he was a sufficiently good sport to make the best of his unfortunate bargain and clatter up the long, dim flights that led to the Harlings' suite with as much spirit as the rest. And oh, such a welcome as the family received when they did arrive! It would have warmed the heart to see the little ones rush to Grandfather Harling, clinging round him like a swarm of bees and clamoring for a story. And a story they got--and not only one but two, three, for Grandfather was a rare story-teller and a great lover of children. Meantime the elders gossiped together, their chief topic of speculation being the sender of the wonderful Christmas dinners. "If you hadn't got one, Carl, I should almost be tempted to think old Corcoran had sent ours to ease his conscience," Hal announced. "But of course he wouldn't have been stretching his philanthropy so far as Mulberry Court, I'm afraid." "Oh, I'm sure the dinner couldn't have come from Mr. Corcoran," put in Louise quickly. "It wouldn't be a bit like him to tie the nuts up with fancy ribbon, and tuck in the presents. No, somebody sent that dinner who really cared, and took pains to have it pretty and tempting. Mr. Corcoran might order us a dinner at the market but he never would have packed the basket himself as--as--Mr. X did." "Well, all I can say is that Mr. X, whoever he is, is a corker; and may he live long and prosper!" Hal declared. "He will prosper," murmured Mrs. Harling in her soft voice. "Such a man cannot help it." "I do wish, though, we knew who he is, don't you?" Mary asked. "I'd just like to thank him." "I fancy Mr. X is not the sort that covets thanks," her mother replied. "Some people take their pleasure in doing a kind deed. I imagine Louise's Mr. X is one of that sort." So they talked on, until suddenly glancing out of the window, Mrs. McGregor exclaimed in consternation, "Why, it is snowing!" Sure enough! A thick smother of flakes whirled down into the deserted streets and cutting short Grandfather Harling's story, the visitors bundled themselves into their wraps. "I hope the children won't take cold," said Mrs. Harling anxiously. "Take cold? Mercy, no! They are tough as nuts, every soul of them," answered their mother. "Having no automobiles they gain it in their health. Poverty has its blessings--I'll say that! Now, Carl, you hold onto Nell and don't let her down on all fours; she is such a fat little blunderbuss! And Mary, keep Martin in the path if you can, or he will lose that huge rubber boot. Uncle Frederick is going to wheel the baby. And remember, Tim, there are to be no snowballs or snow down anybody's neck. You will have plenty of time for that sort of fun to-morrow, if you call it fun. And, children, do try to go down the stairs quietly. Don't forget there are other people on earth besides yourselves. A Merry Christmas, everybody!" "And three cheers for Mr. X!" Hal added boyishly. "Hal Harling, don't you dare set this brood of mine cheering in the hallway! They'll raise the roof," ejaculated Mrs. McGregor, putting up a warning finger. "Not but what I'd gladly cheer the person who sent those dinners; but we mustn't do it here." "Well, it was a jim-dandy dinner, anyway," chuckled Hal. "We'll be eating that turkey for days. It was big as an ostrich!" "Maybe you drew an ostrich by mistake," grinned Carl. "Who knows?" Oh, it would have taken hearts less merry than these to be dampened by the storm! Home plodded the McGregors, shouting gaily amid the piling drifts. "My, it is going to be a real blizzard!" Mrs. McGregor predicted. "Every tree and bush is laden already." "The little shrubs in the park look like cotton bushes," replied Uncle Frederick over his shoulder. "Look, youngsters! You were asking about cotton when it is ripe. That is much the way it looks." He motioned toward the vista of bending foliage. "How pretty it is!" said Mary. "And in reality cotton is prettier by far, for there is always the blue of the sky, the gold of the sunshine, and the green of the country. It is as if one had a snowstorm in summer." There was little opportunity for further talk for the trodden snow narrowed into a ribbon and the walkers were obliged to thread the drifts single file. At last, however, Mulberry Court came into view and with a stamping of feet and a brushing of caps and coats the family were within its welcoming portals. Then James Frederick was dug out of his carriage, shaken, and borne crowing and rosy up the stairs. The flat proved to be warm and comfortable and while Mary lighted the lamps her mother poked up the fire and sprinkled on more coal. "Now let's sit down everybody and have a nice, jolly evening," said she when the outer garments were all stowed away. "Come, Carl, draw up the rocker for Uncle Frederick. And, Timmie, there's room for you here beside me. What's the matter, laddie?" For answer Tim glanced at the steely blue hands of the clock now pointing to six. "Aren't we going to have any supper?" questioned he in an aggrieved tone. "Supper!" exploded his mother. "Surely you are not looking for anything more to eat to-day. You yourself declared only a little while ago that you couldn't eat another morsel." "It wasn't a little while ago; it was hours," Tim affirmed. "We've been to walk since then and I'm hungry." "Hungry! Did you ever hear the likes! Hungry! And the bairn swallowing down turkey until I expected every second he would have apoplexy!" "I'm hungry, too," rejoined Carl with shame-faced candor. "So am I!" piped Martin. "Well, of a pole, "to make him go." Of course in the case of the donkey the pole goes in advance of the nose, and it's a long while before the wisp and the appetite have a passing acquaintance. With the birds at our home the "wisp" is always out, so they are in no hurry to migrate. They do not leave us for so much as a short visit to their folks in Mexico until the molt is well under way. Some summer visitants even molt completely with us, and it is a sorry season. By the time a young bird is able to hustle for himself he wouldn't know his own mother. She has shed the feathers around the beak, leaving her nose or mouth so grotesque one has to laugh. Seeming to understand the joke is at their expense; some of our birds at this time keep well hidden, and come only to the edges of the shrubbery for food, or if overtaken in the open, they run as fast as their legs can carry them. A song-sparrow without a bit of tail is hopping now under the window, chirping her happy note, but hiding if we look at her. A hummer, which yesterday took honey from the flowers we held in our lips, sits on a tiny twig, the picture of despair because her neck feathers are so thin. A mocker who has drank all summer from the dish with the bees, peeps at her shadow and preens imaginary quills. Half of them are on the ground by the table. A phœbe sits alone on the housetop, wailing, thinking no doubt she is singing, and looking the picture of distress, with one tail-feather, and not enough of her ordinary neckerchief around her neck to cover the bare skin of it. And the nests, where are they? Just where they were. But they are faded and old and deserted. Never does a young bird go back to the nest after it has once left it, though some people believe they use it for a bed until long into the autumn. We have not seen them do so. They scorn the old thing! Isn't it as full of mites as it can hold? Of course it is, especially if it be a linnet's nest. When the third brood came out in the same nest we found it so infested with mites, almost invisible, that we could not touch it. And the poor little birdlings had to bide their time in getting away. It is supposed to be on account of these parasites that some birds compose their nests of strong-smelling weeds. However, we have not known any of the nests near us to be disturbed by these parasites save those in which several broods are reared. We have a seven-story flat, on each successive floor of which a linnet and a phœbe have nested. Phœbe's nest is mud, linnet's is straw and hair. Each builds atop of the others. It may grow to be a sky-scraper yet. Many of the mother birds sing at nesting-time. The house-finch, or linnet, keeps a continual twitter while incubating. So also the goldfinches. These notes are low and very musical and happy. The phœbe speaks her mournful note under the eaves while on the nest. By close listening, when other things are noiseless, one may detect the almost inaudible note of some of the hummers. The ear of a nature-lover grows keen by practice. There are low, nearly inarticulate whisperings among the birds in summer days never heard by those who have not learned the art of listening. The nest of the summer yellowbird may be within six feet of a person on the hunt for it, who, though of keen eye, may never find it, for lack of as keen an ear to hear the low note of the mother bird behind the foliage. By close observation one may come to disprove many things said against the birds. For instance, a neighbor told us to be careful how we encouraged the orioles and phœbes to nest in our grounds if we didn't want them to eat up all our honey-bees. As usual with us in such cases, we accepted the warning "with a pinch of salt," and took to making observations on our own account. Locating ourselves behind an open window near the beehives, we watched. A vine trellis with top bar uncovered offered safe footing to phœbe; on she came with five young phœbes hatched on the fourth-floor flat under the eaves. The young birds were whining for food. As plain as any words can be, they cried, "Bees, bees, please!" And bees they were to have for dinner! The mother led them to the trellis bar, where they squatted in a row, peeping their longings. Bees were flying thicker than hail. The mother canted her head from side to side, the black eye of the upward cant searching the homeward-bound insects. "Why don't you help yourself?" we wondered. In a few minutes the bum, bum, of the drones was heard. Then mother phœbe darted, and darted, and darted; each time she snapped a big, sting-less, bumming drone, which she killed by banging its head against the bar. Then it was taken by a little phœbe, or more often by two phœbes, who tugged at the creature until it came in two parts, or was cunningly appropriated as a whole by one of them. This meal-time went on until all were, for the time being, appeased, and the family flew off. By the middle of next day they returned and went through the same performances, very amusing to the witnesses inside the window. Now, not a single worker-bee was touched! And the mother phœbe knew the exact hour for the flying of drones. These lazy, shiftless, bumming fellows never leave the hives until the day is far advanced and the sun has warmed things up. So, not breakfast, but dinner, was made of the drones. As for the orioles, we were willing to give them a chance to speak for themselves. They appeared about April 10th, as usual. And straight for the bee corner of the garden they went. "I told you so!" said the neighbor. We watched. There were rose-bushes and vines in that part of the grounds, and to these the orioles hastened as fast as their wings could take them. The beehives sit under a row of moss-roses so thickly covered with spines that one cannot take hold of them without gloves. But this pair of orioles ran up and down and in and out without fear. These and many other rose-bushes did they examine minutely, pecking away as fast as they could move their beaks. Right at the entrance to the hives they went, on straggling briers, but not a bee did they touch. We were as close to them as we wished to be. Suddenly we scared them away before they should have devoured every secret, and there was retreat for our neighbor! The orioles had been eating the little green plant-lice that infest rose-bushes early in the spring. Later they took to watching the bees, and we resumed our watch of the orioles. It was midsummer, and the young birds were all about, crying for bread, or rather for "bees," though their pronunciation was not so distinct as that of the young phœbes. The parent orioles took their stand right on the doorstep of the hives, and waited with head slightly turned, alert, ready for "a bite." Not a worker did they touch, but when a drone came bumming along he was nabbed as quick as a wink. All drone-time (which lasts about two months with us) did the orioles patronize the beehives. Unmolested did the tireless workers come, pollen-loaded, and run in at the entrance. When the summer yellowbirds have three or four hungry mouths to feed, just watch at the open window behind the snowball-bush and "see what you see." Little green caterpillars make nourishing food for baby yellowbirds. The parents might be running up and down amid the green and white of the bush, just for effect of color, but they are not. Those little, soft, green biscuits are the objects of their ramble. It has been an open question as to whether old birds carry water to the young. In the case of tame canaries they have been seen to regurgitate a whole cropful of the liquid into waiting "parched throats." So we may conclude that young birds require water. In the case of a very young humming-bird who was deprived of its mother, we raised it for a while, at least, on milk sweetened with honey, feeding it with an eye-dropper such as surgeons use. The milk was a good substitute for such animal food as the young of hummers are accustomed to. When young humming-birds come out of the nest, and for many weeks, they are either very fearless or their sight is not good. Surely it is not the latter, unless it be atoned for by greater sense of smell; for they come to flowers we hold up to them, and even light on our hands and faces, following us in the shrubbery. As a rule, young birds are suspicious and wary. They know by instinct how and where to hide. After sundown is the time to see interesting events connected with supper and bedtime. By close and quiet watching one may see for one's self where and how young birds sleep. Some retire to the same bough or bush each night. A family of bush-tits slept in a row on an orange twig every night for two weeks, in plain sight of us, and as near as six feet from our hands. The parents had been blessed with unusual success in this particular brood, bringing off six. These all slept in a row, "heads and tails," whispering the softest of notes until quite dark. We have never been able to account for all the egg-shells that disappear in nesting-times. Now and then cracked bits are found in fields and woods, but only bits. One might get some information from the ants that are always prowling about for detached morsels of animal life. The birds themselves may eat or hide them, lest they tell tales. We have found shells far away from any nests, as if they had been carried on purpose. Sometimes they lie in the nest bottom in powder. It is worth while to take a peep into every nest, just to get "pointers"--but never to get birdlings! And one's peeps should not be too frequent. It disturbs family order and confidence. Besides, if one takes to peeping when the birds are nearly fledged they often become frightened, and leave the nest too immature to warrant freedom and safety. Young birds are seen to sit or cling to the edge of the nest long before they are able to fly. At night they snuggle down into the warmth--and warmth as much as food is essential to young birds. But nesting-time has an end, like all good times. When the late peaches turn their rosiest cheek to the autumn sun, and the husk of the beechnut opens its pale lips, then are the nests that were so lately the center of attraction tenantless and neglected. Old birds, in passing, take no notice of them, and the hungry juveniles pay no visible heed. What care they for cradles, now that the universal cry is "Bread and butter, please"? Baby zephyrs nap on the worn-out linings, and the rain runs its slim fingers through the fading meshes. Even the domestic feline, who was wont to peep into the heart of every one of them, no longer is discovered inquiring into the nesting habits of birds. Forsaken are the nests. Naked are the boughs. We will leave them for the winter winds to question--and the winter winds will ravel more bark for next year's nests, and they will make the meadow-grasses molt their softest wrappers for linings. And it is the winter winds that will swirl the dead leaves into lint, and pull the weed stalks into fiber. Therefore, long live the winter winds! CHAPTER XVI THE ROMANCE OF ORNITHOLOGY The birds must know. Who wisely sings Will sing as they. The common air has generous wings: Songs make their way. What bird is that? The song is good, And eager eyes Go peering through the dusky wood In glad surprise: The birds must know. Helen Hunt Jackson. As everybody knows, ornithology means a discourse about birds--and people have discoursed about birds ever since spoken or written language gave us the means of exchanging thoughts. In the Biblical history of the creation, birds occurred in the fifth epoch of time, when the evolution of grass and herbs and trees and seeds and fruits had made for them a paradise. With the grass and trees and seeds and fruits had evolved a variable diet for the feathered folk, and by instinct they have continued to follow after their food, migrating on merry tours the wide world over. Lovers of them from earliest dates have discoursed of their ways and means, of their habits, their favorite resorts, their uses relative to cultivation of lands, their faults in connection with civilization. Students of nature have divided the birds into "classes" and "species," as the human race itself is divided. As "order is heaven's first law," ornithologists have taught us to distinguish it in the study of birds; and so we have the "groups," always with reference to individual habits and anatomical peculiarities. In the Old World, ornithology as a science dates perhaps from Aristotle, 384 years before Christ. True, he was a teacher of A, B, C's on the subject, but he set students to "thinking," But there were students before Aristotle; if not students of science, they were students of religion. It is to religion in many forms that we owe the romance of ornithology. We may call this phase of the subject "superstition." The word itself is almost gruesome to the unlettered imagination. It suggests uncanny things, ghosts and goblins, and other creatures that are supposed to wander around in the dark, because they were never seen at midday or any other time. To the educated person actual faith in ghosts and goblins has given place to a mildly fanciful imagination which indulges in the flavor of superstition, as one takes light desserts after a full meal. And so we have the romance of superstition for the intelligent. Stopping to consider that the word itself means a "standing still" to "stare" at something, an attitude of reverence, so to speak, we see how religion in ornithology preceded the romance of it. Certain of the birds waited on the deities, or had access to their presence, in consequence of which they were set apart and protected. Sometimes they were prophets of the gods, foretelling future events with accuracy. Their flights were noted by religious devotees, who, unconsciously to themselves probably, and certainly unsuspected, by their followers, were sure to be "out" at migration times. At such times, should the birds choose a natural course past a city and be seen only after they had left it behind them, the prophet knew, in the depths of his religious being, that the gods had doomed that city. It was only when the study of birds as an actual science developed the fact that these denizens of the air depended more upon climate and necessary diet than upon the will of gruesome gods that the religion of ornithology gave place to romance. And romance is the after-dinner course of real ornithology--romance lends a fanciful touch to figures and data, and apologizes to the average student for intermissions that seem dedicated to frolic. In the universe of romance, North America has its full share. Preceding the romance was, and still is (among the native tribes), the religion of superstition. The deities foretell certain death of persons among the Eskimos by the passing of a bluejay or the croak of a raven. Our own poet, Edgar Allan Poe, was not an Eskimo, but he indulged in the well-known superstitions about the bird when he permitted the raven to perch above his door. Many of the Arctic tribes are known to protect the ominous bird to this day. The Indians of Alaska revere and even fear it, like a black spirit from the land of demons. Song and story among American aborigines are replete with bird superstition. So prominent was it that early historians made mention of it to preserve it, and students of languages are putting it into books, so that romance and legend may not pass away with our native Indians. The government itself is preserving the history of American superstition among its precious archives. Reports of the Ethnological Bureau are entertaining reading for vacation times. True, they are "heavy volumes" in some cases, but there are supplements. Were these reports placed in more school and other libraries, the inclination to read more objectionable and not half so entertaining literature would go quickly out, like a fire-proof match, without burning the fingers. To those who find a fascination in prehistoric legends the study of bird representation on the ancient pottery of some of our western Indians, and in the mounds of the Mississippi Valley, is offered in some of these government reports. They are a very mine of suggestion and information. Imagination, subtle guide to many a self-entertaining mind, runs fast and faster on before while one reads, and one wonders how it came to pass one never knew about government reports before. The Ethnological Bureau is the poet's corner of our government--the romance of our dull facts and figures. Without its unsleeping eye forever scanning the sky of unwritten literature for gems, how would some of us know about the history of the human race as preserved by the Iroquois Indians? And that birds had a wing, if not a hand, in the peopling of America at least? Of course America was "all the world" to these Indians, and naturally enough their priests and poets combined to give some adequate genesis for the people. It is said that a story, once started on its rounds in civilized society, gathers facts and things as it goes, until at last--and not before very long--its own original parent "wouldn't recognize it." Not so the legends that have come to us through savage tongues. Simple to start with, they maintain their original type without a trace of addition. What students gather for us of folk-lore is as correct as though the first text had been copyrighted by its author. Note this simplicity in all barbaric legends, the discourse coming straight to the facts and leaving off when it is done. This one legend referred to of the origin of the human race makes so good a preface to the closing rhyme of our text, that we are tempted to give it for that special purpose. According to this story of the Iroquois Indians, it is to birds that woman owes her history. Unconsciously to these natives of America, they identified woman with birds and birds' wings for all time. Unconsciously, perhaps, to herself, woman has also identified her sex with birds and bird wings, though in a different relation to that of the Iroquois. The legend will need no further introduction to the girl or woman of America who may become interested in "Birds of Song and Story." There was once a time when all the earth was hidden under great waters. No island or continent gave foothold. No tree, torn from its moorings, afforded rest to tired foot or wing; for finny and winged people were all the inhabitants in being. Birds soared unceasingly in the air, and fish disported their beautiful armor-plate in the water. In the consciousness of bird and fish there was need of higher intelligences than themselves. They watched and waited for some hint, some glimpse, of other and superior beings. One day the birds, congregating in the sky, discoursing on this very matter, beheld a lovely woman dropping out of the far blue. Hurriedly they talked of possible means of saving her from drowning, for they had a subtle sense that this falling object, with arms outstretched like wings, was the being they hoped for. One of their number, a prophet, suggested the means. As the lovely being dropped toward the great sea the birds came together and lapped wings over wings in a thick feathered island. Upon the soft deck of this throbbing life-boat the beautiful being descended and lay panting. Slowly and lovingly her soft hand caressed the wings of her benefactors. She lifted the variously tinted plumage of the breasts on which she reclined, and kissed the down of them. That was long, long ago! We will conclude our text with the ending of the poem preceding the first chapter in our book, repeating four lines of the same, and dedicating this same "ending" to the Birds. While the church-bell rings its discourse They are sitting on the spires; Psalm and anthem, song and carol, Quaver as from mystic lyres. Wing and throat are in a tremor, While they pay their Sunday dues, And escorted by the ushers. They are sitting in the pews. Oh, the travesty of worship! Perched above each reverent face. Sit these feathered sacrifices. Closely pinioned to their place. Chant a dirge for woman's pity, Choir, before the text is read! Sing a requiem for compassion, Woman's tenderness is dead. On her head are funeral emblems; She has made herself a bier For the martyred birds who, shroudless, Coffinless, are waiting here. Eyes dilate and forms distorted. Praying as in dumb distress, Poising, crouching, reeling, swooning. Supplicating wretchedness. Twisted into shapes so ghastly, Frightful, grim, disconsolate; Writhing in a moveless torture. Passion inarticulate. Call it "love of what is lovely," "Choice of best in nature's grace," Back of all the giddy tangle Lurks the tradesman's wily face, E.G. * * * * * Index [Transcriber Note: Although two unique copies of this volume are stored at The Internet Archive and both of them list an Index at Page 151, neither one of them has an Index and both end at Page 150.] * * * * * Transcriber Note In order to prevent images from splitting paragraphs, text was reformatted.

Contents Part I Part II Part III Part IV 46 Jakes and the Lady 47 Hard Times 48 Farmer Thoroughgood and His Grandson Willie 49 My Last Home Black Beauty Part I 01 My Early Home The first place that I can well remember was a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water-lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master's house, which stood by the roadside; at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank. While I was young I lived upon my mother's milk, as I could not eat grass. In the daytime I ran by her side, and at night I lay down close by her. When it was hot we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees, and when it was cold we had a nice warm shed near the grove. As soon as I was old enough to eat grass my mother used to go out to work in the daytime, and come back in the evening. There were six young colts in the meadow besides me; they were older than I was; some were nearly as large as grown-up horses. I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop all together round and round the field as hard as we could go. Sometimes we had rather rough play, for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop. One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother whinnied to me to come to her, and then she said: “I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you. The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are cart-horse colts, and of course they have not learned manners. You have been well-bred and well-born; your father has a great name in these parts, and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races; your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew, and I think you have never seen me kick or bite. I hope you will grow up gentle and good, and never learn bad ways; do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick even in play.” I have never forgotten my mother's advice; I knew she was a wise old horse, and our master thought a great deal of her. Her name was Duchess, but he often called her Pet. Our master was a good, kind man. He gave us good food, good lodging, and kind words; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children. We were all fond of him, and my mother loved him very much. When she saw him at the gate she would neigh with joy, and trot up to him. He would pat and stroke her and say, “Well, old Pet, and how is your little Darkie?” I was a dull black, so he called me Darkie; then he would give me a piece of bread, which was very good, and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother. All the horses would come to him, but I think we were his favorites. My mother always took him to the town on a market day in a light gig. There was a plowboy, Dick, who sometimes came into our field to pluck blackberries from the hedge. When he had eaten all he wanted he would have what he called fun with the colts, throwing stones and sticks at them to make them gallop. We did not much mind him, for we could gallop off; but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us. One day he was at this game, and did not know that the master was in the next field; but he was there, watching what was going on; over the hedge he jumped in a snap, and catching Dick by the arm, he gave him such a box on the ear as made him roar with the pain and surprise. As soon as we saw the master we trotted up nearer to see what went on. “Bad boy!” he said, “bad boy! to chase the colts. This is not the first time, nor the second, but it shall be the last. There--take your money and go home; I shall not want you on my farm again.” So we never saw Dick any more. Old Daniel, the man who looked after the horses, was just as gentle as our master, so we were well off. 02 The Hunt Before I was two years old a circumstance happened which I have never forgotten. It was early in the spring; there had been a little frost in the night, and a light mist still hung over the woods and meadows. I and the other colts were feeding at the lower part of the field when we heard, quite in the distance, what sounded like the cry of dogs. The oldest of the colts raised his head, pricked his ears, and said, “There are the hounds!” and immediately cantered off, followed by the rest of us to the upper part of the field, where we could look over the hedge and see several fields beyond. My mother and an old riding horse of our master's were also standing near, and seemed to know all about it. “They have found a hare,” said my mother, “and if they come this way we shall see the hunt.” And soon the dogs were all tearing down the field of young wheat next to ours. I never heard such a noise as they made. They did not bark, nor howl, nor whine, but kept on a “yo! yo, o, o! yo! yo, o, o!” at the top of their voices. After them came a number of men on horseback, some of them in green coats, all galloping as fast as they could. The old horse snorted and looked eagerly after them, and we young colts wanted to be galloping with them, but they were soon away into the fields lower down; here it seemed as if they had come to a stand; the dogs left off barking, and ran about every way with their noses to the ground. “They have lost the scent,” said the old horse; “perhaps the hare will get off.” “What hare?” I said. “Oh! I don't know what hare; likely enough it may be one of our own hares out of the woods; any hare they can find will do for the dogs and men to run after;” and before long the dogs began their “yo! yo, o, o!” again, and back they came altogether at full speed, making straight for our meadow at the part where the high bank and hedge overhang the brook. “Now we shall see the hare,” said my mother; and just then a hare wild with fright rushed by and made for the woods. On came the dogs; they burst over the bank, leaped the stream, and came dashing across the field followed by the huntsmen. Six or eight men leaped their horses clean over, close upon the dogs. The hare tried to get through the fence; it was too thick, and she turned sharp round to make for the road, but it was too late; the dogs were upon her with their wild cries; we heard one shriek, and that was the end of her. One of the huntsmen rode up and whipped off the dogs, who would soon have torn her to pieces. He held her up by the leg torn and bleeding, and all the gentlemen seemed well pleased. As for me, I was so astonished that I did not at first see what was going on by the brook; but when I did look there was a sad sight; two fine horses were down, one was struggling in the stream, and the other was groaning on the grass. One of the riders was getting out of the water covered with mud, the other lay quite still. “His neck is broke,” said my mother. “And serve him right, too,” said one of the colts. I thought the same, but my mother did not join with us. “Well, no,” she said, “you must not say that; but though I am an old horse, and have seen and heard a great deal, I never yet could make out why men are so fond of this sport; they often hurt themselves, often spoil good horses, and tear up the fields, and all for a hare or a fox, or a stag, that they could get more easily some other way; but we are only horses, and don't know.” While my mother was saying this we stood and looked on. Many of the riders had gone to the young man; but my master, who had been watching what was going on, was the first to raise him. His head fell back and his arms hung down, and every one looked very serious. There was no noise now; even the dogs were quiet, and seemed to know that something was wrong. They carried him to our master's house. I heard afterward that it was young George Gordon, the squire's only son, a fine, tall young man, and the pride of his family. There was now riding off in all directions to the doctor's, to the farrier's, and no doubt to Squire Gordon's, to let him know about his son. When Mr. Bond, the farrier, came to look at the black horse that lay groaning on the grass, he felt him all over, and shook his head; one of his legs was broken. Then some one ran to our master's house and came back with a gun; presently there was a loud bang and a dreadful shriek, and then all was still; the black horse moved no more. My mother seemed much troubled; she said she had known that horse for years, and that his name was “Rob Roy”; he was a good horse, and there was no vice in him. She never would go to that part of the field afterward. Not many days after we heard the church-bell tolling for a long time, and looking over the gate we saw a long, strange black coach that was covered with black cloth and was drawn by black horses; after that came another and another and another, and all were black, while the bell kept tolling, tolling. They were carrying young Gordon to the churchyard to bury him. He would never ride again. What they did with Rob Roy I never knew; but 'twas all for one little hare. 03 My Breaking In I was now beginning to grow handsome; my coat had grown fine and soft, and was bright black. I had one white foot and a pretty white star on my forehead. I was thought very handsome; my master would not sell me till I was four years old; he said lads ought not to work like men, and colts ought not to work like horses till they were quite grown up. When I was four years old Squire Gordon came to look at me. He examined my eyes, my mouth, and my legs; he felt them all down; and then I had to walk and trot and gallop before him. He seemed to like me, and said, “When he has been well broken in he will do very well.” My master said he would break me in himself, as he should not like me to be frightened or hurt, and he lost no time about it, for the next day he began. Every one may not know what breaking in is, therefore I will describe it. It means to teach a horse to wear a saddle and bridle, and to carry on his back a man, woman or child; to go just the way they wish, and to go quietly. Besides this he has to learn to wear a collar, a crupper, and a breeching, and to stand still while they are put on; then to have a cart or a chaise fixed behind, so that he cannot walk or trot without dragging it after him; and he must go fast or slow, just as his driver wishes. He must never start at what he sees, nor speak to other horses, nor bite, nor kick, nor have any will of his own; but always do his master's will, even though he may be very tired or hungry; but the worst of all is, when his harness is once on, he may neither jump for joy nor lie down for weariness. So you see this breaking in is a great thing. I had of course long been used to a halter and a headstall, and to be led about in the fields and lanes quietly, but now I was to have a bit and bridle; my master gave me some oats as usual, and after a good deal of coaxing he got the bit into my mouth, and the bridle fixed, but it was a nasty thing! Those who have never had a bit in their mouths cannot think how bad it feels; a great piece of cold hard steel as thick as a man's finger to be pushed into one's mouth, between one's teeth, and over one's tongue, with the ends coming out at the corner of your mouth, and held fast there by straps over your head, under your throat, round your nose, and under your chin; so that no way in the world can you get rid of the nasty hard thing; it is very bad! yes, very bad! at least I thought so; but I knew my mother always wore one when she went out, and all horses did when they were grown up; and so, what with the nice oats, and what with my master's pats, kind words, and gentle ways, I got to wear my bit and bridle. Next came the saddle, but that was not half so bad; my master put it on my back very gently, while old Daniel held my head; he then made the girths fast under my body, patting and talking to me all the time; then I had a few oats, then a little leading about; and this he did every day till I began to look for the oats and the saddle. At length, one morning, my master got on my back and rode me round the meadow on the soft grass. It certainly did feel queer; but I must say I felt rather proud to carry my master, and as he continued to ride me a little every day I soon became accustomed to it. The next unpleasant business was putting on the iron shoes; that too was very hard at first. My master went with me to the smith's forge, to see that I was not hurt or got any fright. The blacksmith took my feet in his hand, one after the other, and cut away some of the hoof. It did not pain me, so I stood still on three legs till he had done them all. Then he took a piece of iron the shape of my foot, and clapped it on, and drove some nails through the shoe quite into my hoof, so that the shoe was firmly on. My feet felt very stiff and heavy, but in time I got used to it. And now having got so far, my master went on to break me to harness; there were more new things to wear. First, a stiff heavy collar just on my neck, and a bridle with great side-pieces against my eyes called blinkers, and blinkers indeed they were, for I could not see on either side, but only straight in front of me; next, there was a small saddle with a nasty stiff strap that went right under my tail; that was the crupper. I hated the crupper; to have my long tail doubled up and poked through that strap was almost as bad as the bit. I never felt more like kicking, but of course I could not kick such a good master, and so in time I got used to everything, and could do my work as well as my mother. I must not forget to mention one part of my training, which I have always considered a very great advantage. My master sent me for a fortnight to a neighboring farmer's, who had a meadow which was skirted on one side by the railway. Here were some sheep and cows, and I was turned in among them. I shall never forget the first train that ran by. I was feeding quietly near the pales which separated the meadow from the railway, when I heard a strange sound at a distance, and before I knew whence it came--with a rush and a clatter, and a puffing out of smoke--a long black train of something flew by, and was gone almost before I could draw my breath. I turned and galloped to the further side of the meadow as fast as I could go, and there I stood snorting with astonishment and fear. In the course of the day many other trains went by, some more slowly; these drew up at the station close by, and sometimes made an awful shriek and groan before they stopped. I thought it very dreadful, but the cows went on eating very quietly, and hardly raised their heads as the black frightful thing came puffing and grinding past. For the first few days I could not feed in peace; but as I found that this terrible creature never came into the field, or did me any harm, I began to disregard it, and very soon I cared as little about the passing of a train as the cows and sheep did. Since then I have seen many horses much alarmed and restive at the sight or sound of a steam engine; but thanks to my good master's care, I am as fearless at railway stations as in my own stable. Now if any one wants to break in a young horse well, that is the way. My master often drove me in double harness with my mother, because she was steady and could teach me how to go better than a strange horse. She told me the better I behaved the better I should be treated, and that it was wisest always to do my best to please my master; “but,” said she, “there are a great many kinds of men; there are good thoughtful men like our master, that any horse may be proud to serve; and there are bad, cruel men, who never ought to have a horse or dog to call their own. Besides, there are a great many foolish men, vain, ignorant, and careless, who never trouble themselves to think; these spoil more horses than all, just for want of sense; they don't mean it, but they do it for all that. I hope you will fall into good hands; but a horse never knows who may buy him, or who may drive him; it is all a chance for us; but still I say, do your best wherever it is, and keep up your good name.” 04 Birtwick Park At this time I used to stand in the stable and my coat was brushed every day till it shone like a rook's wing. It was early in May, when there came a man from Squire Gordon's, who took me away to the hall. My master said, “Good-by, Darkie; be a good horse, and always do your best.” I could not say “good-by”, so I put my nose into his hand; he patted me kindly, and I left my first home. As I lived some years with Squire Gordon, I may as well tell something about the place. Squire Gordon's park skirted the village of Birtwick. It was entered by a large iron gate, at which stood the first lodge, and then you trotted along on a smooth road between clumps of large old trees; then another lodge and another gate, which brought you to the house and the gardens. Beyond this lay the home paddock, the old orchard, and the stables. There was accommodation for many horses and carriages; but I need only describe the stable into which I was taken; this was very roomy, with four good stalls; a large swinging window opened into the yard, which made it pleasant and airy. The first stall was a large square one, shut in behind with a wooden gate; the others were common stalls, good stalls, but not nearly so large; it had a low rack for hay and a low manger for corn; it was called a loose box, because the horse that was put into it was not tied up, but left loose, to do as he liked. It is a great thing to have a loose box. Into this fine box the groom put me; it was clean, sweet, and airy. I never was in a better box than that, and the sides were not so high but that I could see all that went on through the iron rails that were at the top. He gave me some very nice oats, he patted me, spoke kindly, and then went away. When I had eaten my corn I looked round. In the stall next to mine stood a little fat gray pony, with a thick mane and tail, a very pretty head, and a pert little nose. I put my head up to the iron rails at the top of my box, and said, “How do you do? What is your name?” He turned round as far as his halter would allow, held up his head, and said, “My name is Merrylegs. I am very handsome; I carry the young ladies on my back, and sometimes I take our mistress out in the low chair. They think a great deal of me, and so does James. Are you going to live next door to me in the box?” I said, “Yes.” “Well, then,” he said, “I hope you are good-tempered; I do not like any one next door who bites.” Just then a horse's head looked over from the stall beyond; the ears were laid back, and the eye looked rather ill-tempered. This was a tall chestnut mare, with a long handsome neck. She looked across to me and said: “So it is you who have turned me out of my box; it is a very strange thing for a colt like you to come and turn a lady out of her own home.” “I beg your pardon,” I said, “I have turned no one out; the man who brought me put me here, and I had nothing to do with it; and as to my being a colt, I am turned four years old and am a grown-up horse. I never had words yet with horse or mare, and it is my wish to live at peace.” “Well,” she said, “we shall see. Of course, I do not want to have words with a young thing like you.” I said no more. In the afternoon, when she went out, Merrylegs told me all about it. “The thing is this,” said Merrylegs. “Ginger has a bad habit of biting and snapping; that is why they call her Ginger, and when she was in the loose box she used to snap very much. One day she bit James in the arm and made it bleed, and so Miss Flora and Miss Jessie, who are very fond of me, were afraid to come into the stable. They used to bring me nice things to eat, an apple or a carrot, or a piece of bread, but after Ginger stood in that box they dared not come, and I missed them very much. I hope they will now come again, if you do not bite or snap.” I told him I never bit anything but grass, hay, and corn, and could not think what pleasure Ginger found it. “Well, I don't think she does find pleasure,” says Merrylegs; “it is just a bad habit; she says no one was ever kind to her, and why should she not bite? Of course, it is a very bad habit; but I am sure, if all she says be true, she must have been very ill-used before she came here. John does all he can to please her, and James does all he can, and our master never uses a whip if a horse acts right; so I think she might be good-tempered here. You see,” he said, with a wise look, “I am twelve years old; I know a great deal, and I can tell you there is not a better place for a horse all round the country than this. John is the best groom that ever was; he has been here fourteen years; and you never saw such a kind boy as James is; so that it is all Ginger's own fault that she did not stay in that box.” 05 A Fair Start The name of the coachman was John Manly; he had a wife and one little child, and they lived in the coachman's cottage, very near the stables. The next morning he took me into the yard and gave me a good grooming, and just as I was going into my box, with my coat soft and bright, the squire came in to look at me, and seemed pleased. “John,” he said, “I meant to have tried the new horse this morning, but I have other business. You may as well take him around after breakfast; go by the common and the Highwood, and back by the watermill and the river; that will show his paces.” “I will, sir,” said John. After breakfast he came and fitted me with a bridle. He was very particular in letting out and taking in the straps, to fit my head comfortably; then he brought a saddle, but it was not broad enough for my back; he saw it in a minute and went for another, which fitted nicely. He rode me first slowly, then a trot, then a canter, and when we were on the common he gave me a light touch with his whip, and we had a splendid gallop. “Ho, ho! my boy,” he said, as he pulled me up, “you would like to follow the hounds, I think.” As we came back through the park we met the Squire and Mrs. Gordon walking; they stopped, and John jumped off. “Well, John, how does he go?” “First-rate, sir,” answered John; “he is as fleet as a deer, and has a fine spirit too; but the lightest touch of the rein will guide him. Down at the end of the common we met one of those traveling carts hung all over with baskets, rugs, and such like; you know, sir, many horses will not pass those carts quietly; he just took a good look at it, and then went on as quiet and pleasant as could be. They were shooting rabbits near the Highwood, and a gun went off close by; he pulled up a little and looked, but did not stir a step to right or left. I just held the rein steady and did not hurry him, and it's my opinion he has not been frightened or ill-used while he was young.” “That's well,” said the squire, “I will try him myself to-morrow.” The next day I was brought up for my master. I remembered my mother's counsel and my good old master's, and I tried to do exactly what he wanted me to do. I found he was a very good rider, and thoughtful for his horse too. When he came home the lady was at the hall door as he rode up. “Well, my dear,” she said, “how do you like him?” “He is exactly what John said,” he replied; “a pleasanter creature I never wish to mount. What shall we call him?” “Would you like Ebony?” said she; “he is as black as ebony.” “No, not Ebony.” “Will you call him Blackbird, like your uncle's old horse?” “No, he is far handsomer than old Blackbird ever was.” “Yes,” she said, “he is really quite a beauty, and he has such a sweet, good-tempered face, and such a fine, intelligent eye--what do you say to calling him Black Beauty?” “Black Beauty--why, yes, I think that is a very good name. If you like it shall be his name;” and so it was. When John went into the stable he told James that master and mistress had chosen a good, sensible English name for me, that meant something; not like Marengo, or Pegasus, or Abdallah. They both laughed, and James said, “If it was not for bringing back the past, I should have named him Rob Roy, for I never saw two horses more alike.” “That's no wonder,” said John; “didn't you know that Farmer Grey's old Duchess was the mother of them both?” I had never heard that before; and so poor Rob Roy who was killed at that hunt was my brother! I did not wonder that my mother was so troubled. It seems that horses have no relations; at least they never know each other after they are sold. John seemed very proud of me; he used to make my mane and tail almost as smooth as a lady's hair, and he would talk to me a great deal; of course I did not understand all he said, but I learned more and more to know what he meant, and what he wanted me to do. I grew very fond of him, he was so gentle and kind; he seemed to know just how a horse feels, and when he cleaned me he knew the tender places and the ticklish places; when he brushed my head he went as carefully over my eyes as if they were his own, and never stirred up any ill-temper. James Howard, the stable boy, was just as gentle and pleasant in his way, so I thought myself well off. There was another man who helped in the yard, but he had very little to do with Ginger and me. A few days after this I had to go out with Ginger in the carriage. I wondered how we should get on together; but except laying her ears back when I was led up to her, she behaved very well. She did her work honestly, and did her full share, and I never wish to have a better partner in double harness. When we came to a hill, instead of slackening her pace, she would throw her weight right into the collar, and pull away straight up. We had both the same sort of courage at our work, and John had oftener to hold us in than to urge us forward; he never had to use the whip with either of us; then our paces were much the same, and I found it very easy to keep step with her when trotting, which made it pleasant, and master always liked it when we kept step well, and so did John. After we had been out two or three times together we grew quite friendly and sociable, which made me feel very much at home. As for Merrylegs, he and I soon became great friends; he was such a cheerful, plucky, good-tempered little fellow that he was a favorite with every one, and especially with Miss Jessie and Flora, who used to ride him about in the orchard, and have fine games with him and their little dog Frisky. Our master had two other horses that stood in another stable. One was Justice, a roan cob, used for riding or for the luggage cart; the other was an old brown hunter, named Sir Oliver; he was past work now, but was a great favorite with the master, who gave him the run of the park; he sometimes did a little light carting on the estate, or carried one of the young ladies when they rode out with their father, for he was very gentle and could be trusted with a child as well as Merrylegs. The cob was a strong, well-made, good-tempered horse, and we sometimes had a little chat in the paddock, but of course I could not be so intimate with him as with Ginger, who stood in the same stable. 06 Liberty I was quite happy in my new place, and if there was one thing that I missed it must not be thought I was discontented; all who had to do with me were good and I had a light airy stable and the best of food. What more could I want? Why, liberty! For three years and a half of my life I had had all the liberty I could wish for; but now, week after week, month after month, and no doubt year after year, I must stand up in a stable night and day except when I am wanted, and then I must be just as steady and quiet as any old horse who has worked twenty years. Straps here and straps there, a bit in my mouth, and blinkers over my eyes. Now, I am not complaining, for I know it must be so. I only mean to say that for a young horse full of strength and spirits, who has been used to some large field or plain where he can fling up his head and toss up his tail and gallop away at full speed, then round and back again with a snort to his companions--I say it is hard never to have a bit more liberty to do as you like. Sometimes, when I have had less exercise than usual, I have felt so full of life and spring that when John has taken me out to exercise I really could not keep quiet; do what I would, it seemed as if I must jump, or dance, or prance, and many a good shake I know I must have given him, especially at the first; but he was always good and patient. “Steady, steady, my boy,” he would say; “wait a bit, and we will have a good swing, and soon get the tickle out of your feet.” Then as soon as we were out of the village, he would give me a few miles at a spanking trot, and then bring me back as fresh as before, only clear of the fidgets, as he called them. Spirited horses, when not enough exercised, are often called skittish, when it is only play; and some grooms will punish them, but our John did not; he knew it was only high spirits. Still, he had his own ways of making me understand by the tone of his voice or the touch of the rein. If he was very serious and quite determined, I always knew it by his voice, and that had more power with me than anything else, for I was very fond of him. I ought to say that sometimes we had our liberty for a few hours; this used to be on fine Sundays in the summer-time. The carriage never went out on Sundays, because the church was not far off. It was a great treat to us to be turned out into the home paddock or the old orchard; the grass was so cool and soft to our feet, the air so sweet, and the freedom to do as we liked was so pleasant--to gallop, to lie down, and roll over on our backs, or to nibble the sweet grass. Then it was a very good time for talking, as we stood together under the shade of the large chestnut tree. 07 Ginger One day when Ginger and I were standing alone in the shade, we had a great deal of talk; she wanted to know all about my bringing up and breaking in, and I told her. “Well,” said she, “if I had had your bringing up I might have had as good a temper as you, but now I don't believe I ever shall.” “Why not?” I said. “Because it has been all so different They devoured many of their foes, and these also slew many of the ants; but help came to the emmets: now an ant would go up to an ape and smite him and cut him in twain, whilst ten apes could hardly master one ant and bear him away and tear him in sunder. The sore battle lasted till the evening but the emmets were victorious. In the gloaming Janshah and his men took to flight and fled along the sole of the Wady——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Fifth Night, She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that in the gloaming Janshah and his men took to flight and fled along the sole of the Wady till the morning. With the break of day, the apes were up and at them, which when the Prince saw, he shouted to his men, “Smite with your swords.” So they bared their blades and laid on load right and left, till there ran at them an ape, with tusks like an elephant, and smote one of the Mamelukes and cut him in sunder. Then the apes redoubled upon Janshah and he fled with his followers into the lower levels of the valley, where he saw a vast river and by its side a mighty many of ants. When the emmets espied Janshah they pushed on and surrounded him, and one of the slaves fell to smiting them with his sword and cutting them in twain; whereupon the whole host set upon him and slew him. At this pass, behold, up came the apes from over the mountain and fell in numbers upon Janshah; but he tore off his clothes and, plunging into the river, with his remaining servant, struck out for the middle of the stream. Presently, he caught sight of a tree on the other bank; so he swam up to it and laying hold of one of its branches, hung to it and swung himself ashore, but as for the last Mameluke the current carried him away and dashed him to pieces against the mountain. Thereupon Janshah fell to wringing his clothes and spreading them in the sun to dry, what while there befel a fierce fight between the apes and the ants, until the apes gave up the pursuit and returned to their own land. Meanwhile, Janshah, who abode alone on the river-bank, could do naught but shed tears till nightfall, when he took refuge in a cavern and there passed the dark hours, in great fear and feeling desolate for the loss of his slaves. At daybreak awaking from his sleep he set out again and fared on nights and days, eating of the herbs of the earth, till he came to the mountain which burnt like fire, and thence he made the river which dried up every Sabbath. Now it was a mighty stream and on the opposite bank stood a great city, which was the capital of the Jews mentioned in the tablet. Here he abode till the next Sabbath, when the river dried up and he walked over to the other side and entered the Jew city, but saw none in the streets. So he wandered about till he came to the door of a homestead, which he opened and entering, espied within the people of the house sitting in silence and speaking not a syllable. Quoth he, “I am a stranger and anhungered;” and they signed to him, as to say, “Eat and drink, but speak not.”[543] So he ate and drank and slept that night and, when morning dawned, the master of the house greeted him and bade him welcome and asked him, “Whence comest thou and whither art thou bound?” At these words Janshah wept sore and told him all that had befallen him and how his father was King of Kabul; whereat the Jew marvelled and said, “Never heard we of that city, but we have heard from the merchants of the caravans that in that direction lieth a land called Al-Yaman.” “How far is that land from this place?” asked Janshah, and the Jew answered, “The Cafilah merchants pretend that it is a two years and three months’ march from their land hither.” Quoth Janshah, “And when doth the caravan come?” Quoth the Jew, “Next year ‘twill come.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Sixth Night, She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Jew was questioned anent the coming of the caravan, he replied, “Next year ‘twill come.” At these words the Prince wept sore and fell a-sorrowing for himself and his Mamelukes; and lamenting his separation from his mother and father and all which had befallen him in his wanderings. Then said the Jew, “O young man, do not weep, but sojourn with us till the caravan shall come, when we will send thee with it to thine own country.” So he tarried with the Jew two whole months and every day he went out walking in the streets for his solace and diversion. Now it chanced one day, whilst he paced about the main thoroughfares, as of wont, and was bending his steps right and left, he heard a crier crying aloud and saying, “Who will earn a thousand gold pieces and a slave-girl of surpassing beauty and loveliness by working for me between morning and noontide?” But no one answered him and Janshah said in his mind, “Were not this work dangerous and difficult, he would not offer a thousand dinars and a fair girl for half a day’s labour.” Then he accosted the crier and said, “I will do the work;” so the man carried him to a lofty mansion where they found one who was a Jew and a merchant, seated on an ebony chair, to whom quoth the crier, standing respectfully before him, “O merchant, I have cried every day these three months, and none hath answered, save this young man.” Hearing his speech the Jew welcomed Janshah, led him into a magnificent sitting-room and signalled to bring food. So the servants spread the table and set thereon all manner meats, of which the merchant and Janshah ate, and washed their hands. Then wine was served up and they drank; after which the Jew rose and bringing Janshah a purse of a thousand dinars and a slave-girl of rare beauty, said to him, “Take maid and money to thy hire.” Janshah took them and seated the girl by his side when the trader resumed, “To-morrow to the work!”; and so saying he withdrew and Janshah slept with the damsel that night. As soon as it was morning, the merchant bade his slaves clothe him in a costly suit of silk whenas he came out of the Hammam-bath. So they did as he bade them and brought him back to the house, whereupon the merchant called for harp and lute and wine and they drank and played and made merry till the half of the night was past, when the Jew retired to his Harim and Janshah lay with his slave-girl till the dawn. Then he went to the bath and on his return, the merchant came to him and said, “Now I wish thee to do the work for me.” “I hear and obey,” replied Janshah. So the merchant bade his slaves bring two she-mules and set Janshah on one, mounting the other himself. Then they rode forth from the city and fared on from morn till noon, when they made a lofty mountain, to whose height was no limit. Here the Jew dismounted, ordering Janshah to do the same; and when he obeyed the merchant gave him a knife and a cord, saying, “I desire that thou slaughter this mule.” So Janshah tucked up his sleeves and skirts and going up to the mule, bound her legs with the cord, then threw her and cut her throat; after which he skinned her and lopped off her head and legs and she became a mere heap of flesh. Then said the Jew, “Slit open the mule’s belly and enter it and I will sew it up on thee. There must thou abide awhile and whatsoever thou seest in her belly, acquaint me therewith.” So Janshah slit the mule’s belly and crept into it, whereupon the merchant sewed it up on him and withdrew to a distance,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Seventh Night, She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant sewed up the mule’s belly on Janshah and, withdrawing to a distance, hid himself in the skirts of the mountain. After a while a huge bird swooped down on the dead mule and snatching it up, flew up with it to the top of the mountain, where it set down the quarry and would have eaten it; but Janshah, feeling the bird begin to feed, slit the mule’s belly and came forth. When the bird saw him, it took fright at him and flew right away; whereupon he stood up and looking right and left, saw nothing but the carcasses of dead men, mummied by the sun, and exclaimed, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!” Then he looked down the precipice and espied the merchant standing at the mountain-foot, looking for him. As soon as the Jew caught sight of him, he called out to him, “Throw me down of the stones which are about thee, that I may direct thee to a way whereby thou mayst descend.” So Janshah threw him down some two hundred of the stones, which were all rubies,[544] chrysolites and other gems of price; after which he called out to him, saying, “Show me the way down and I will throw thee as many more.” But the Jew gathered up the stones and, binding them on the back of the mule, went his way without answering a word and left Janshah alone on the mountain-top. When the Prince found himself deserted, he began to weep and implore help of Heaven, and thus he abode three days; after which he rose and fared on over the mountainous ground two month’s space, feeding upon hill-herbs; and he ceased not faring till he came to its skirts and espied afar off a Wady full of fruitful trees and birds harmonious singing the praises of Allah, the One, the Victorious. At this sight he joyed with great joy and stayed not his steps till, after an hour or so, he came to a ravine in the rocks, through which the rain-torrents fell into the valley. He made his way down the cleft till he reached the Wady which he had seen from the mountain-top and walked on therein, gazing right and left, nor ceased so doing until he came in sight of a great castle, towering high in air. As he drew near the gates he saw an old man of comely aspect and face shining with light standing thereat with a staff of carnelian in his hand, and going up to him, saluted him. The Shaykh returned his salam and bade him welcome, saying, “Sit down, O my son.” So he sat down at the door of the castle and the old man said to him, “How camest thou to this land, untrodden by son of Adam before thee, and whither art thou bound?” When Janshah heard his words he wept bitterly at the thought of all the hardships he had suffered and his tears choked his speech. Quoth the Shaykh, “O my son, leave weeping; for indeed thou makest my heart ache.” So saying, he rose and set somewhat of food before him and said to him, “Eat.” He ate and praised Allah Almighty; after which the old man besought him saying, “O my son, I would have thee tell me thy tale and acquaint me with thine adventures.” So Janshah related to him all that had befallen him, from first to last, whereat the Shaykh marvelled with exceeding marvel. Then said the Prince, “Prithee inform me who is the lord of this valley and to whom doth this great castle belong?” Answered the old man, “Know, O my son, this valley and all that is therein and this castle with all it containeth belong to the lord Solomon, son of David (on both be peace!). As for me, my name is Shaykh Nasr,[545] King of the Birds; for thou must know that the lord Solomon committed this castle to my charge,”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Eighth Night, She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shaykh Nasr pursued, “Thou must know that the lord Solomon committed this castle to my charge and taught me the language of birds and made me ruler over all the fowls which be in the world; wherefore each and every come hither once in the twelvemonth, and I pass them in review: then they depart; and this is why I dwell here.” When Janshah heard this, he wept sore and said to the Shaykh, “O my father, how shall I do to get back to my native land?” Replied the old man, “Know, O my son, that thou art near to the mountain Kaf, and there is no departing for thee from this place till the birds come, when I will give thee in charge to one of them, and he will bear thee to thy native country. Meanwhile tarry with me here and eat and drink and divert thyself with viewing the apartments of this castle.” So Janshah abode with Shaykh Nasr, taking his pleasure in the Wady and eating of its fruits and laughing and making merry with the old man, and leading a right joyous life till the day appointed for the birds to pay their annual visit to their Governor. Thereupon the Shaykh said to him, “O Janshah, take the keys of the castle and solace thyself with exploring all its apartments and viewing whatever be therein, but as regards such a room, beware and again beware of opening its door; and if thou gainsay me and open it and enter therethrough nevermore shalt thou know fair fortune.” He repeated this charge again and again with much instance; then he went forth to meet the birds, which came up, kind by kind, and kissed his hands. Such was his case; but as regards Janshah, he went round about the castle, opening the various doors and viewing the apartments into which they led, till he came to the room which Shaykh Nasr had warned him not to open or enter. He looked at the door and its fashion pleased him, for it had on it a padlock of gold, and he said to himself, “This room must be goodlier than all the others; would Heaven I wist what is within it, that Shaykh Nasr should forbid me to open its door! There is no help but that I enter and see what is in this apartment; for whatso is decreed unto the creature perforce he must fulfil.” So he put out his hand and unlocked the door and entering, found himself before a great basin; and hard by it stood a little pavilion, builded all of gold and silver and crystal, with lattice-windows of jacinth. The floor was paved with green beryl and balass rubies and emeralds and other jewels, set in the ground-work mosaic-fashion, and in the midmost of the pavilion was a jetting fountain in a golden basin, full of water and girt about with figures of beasts and birds, cunningly wrought of gold and silver and casting water from their mouths. When the zephyr blew on them, it entered their ears and therewith the figures sang out with birdlike song, each in its own tongue. Beside the fountain was a great open saloon with a high daïs whereon stood a vast throne of carnelian, inlaid with pearls and jewels, over which was spread a tent of green silk fifty cubits in width and embroidered with gems fit for seal-rings and purfled with precious metals. Within this tent was a closet containing the carpet of the lord Solomon (on whom be peace!); and the pavilion was compassed about with a vast garden full of fruit-trees and streams; while near the palace were beds of roses and basil and eglantine and all manner sweet-smelling herbs and flowers. And the trees bore on the same boughs fruits fresh and dry and the branches swayed gracefully to the wooing of the wind. All this was in that one apartment and Janshah wondered thereat till he was weary of wonderment; and he set out to solace himself in the palace and the garden and to divert himself with the quaint and curious things they contained. And first looking at the basin he saw that the gravels of its bed were gems and jewels and noble metals; and many other strange things were in that apartment.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Ninth Night, She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Janshah saw many strange things and admirable in that apartment. Then he entered the pavilion and mounting the throne, fell asleep under the tent set up thereover. He slept for a time and, presently awaking, walked forth and sat down on a stool before the door. As he sat, marvelling at the goodliness of that place, there flew up from mid-sky three birds, in dove-form but big as eagles, and lighted on the brink of the basin, where they sported awhile. Then they put off their feathers and became three maidens,[546] as they were moons, that had not their like in the whole world. They plunged into the basin and swam about and disported themselves and laughed, while Janshah marvelled at their beauty and loveliness and the grace and symmetry of their shapes. Presently, they came up out of the water and began walking about and taking their solace in the garden; and Janshah seeing them land was like to lose his wits. He rose and followed them, and when he overtook them, he saluted them and they returned his salam; after which quoth he, “Who are ye, O illustrious Princesses, and whence come ye?” Replied the youngest damsel, “We are from the invisible world of Almighty Allah and we come hither to divert ourselves.” He marvelled at their beauty and said to the youngest, “Have ruth on me and deign kindness to me and take pity on my case and on all that hath befallen me in my life.” Rejoined she, “Leave this talk and wend thy ways”; whereat the tears streamed from his eyes, and he sighed heavily and repeated these couplets:— She shone out in the garden in garments all of green, ✿ With open vest and collars and flowing hair beseen: “What is thy name?” I asked her, and she replied, “I’m she ✿ Who roasts the hearts of lovers on coals of love and teen.” Of passion and its anguish to her I made my moan; ✿ “Upon a rock,” she answered, “thy plaints are wasted clean.” “Even if thy heart,” I told her, “be rock in very deed, ✿ Yet hath God made fair water well from the rock, I ween.”[547] When the maidens heard his verses, they laughed and played and sang and made merry. Then he brought them somewhat of fruit, and they ate and drank and slept with him till the morning, when they donned their feather-suits, and resuming dove shape flew off and went their way. But as he saw them disappearing from sight, his reason well-nigh fled with them, and he gave a great cry and fell down in a fainting fit and lay a-swooning all that day. While he was in this case Shaykh Nasr returned from the Parliament of the Fowls and sought for Janshah, that he might send him with them to his native land, but found him not and knew that he had entered the forbidden room. Now he had already said to the birds, “With me is a young man, a mere youth, whom destiny brought hither from a distant land; and I desire of you that ye take him up and carry him to his own country.” And all answered, “We hear and we obey.” So he ceased not searching for Janshah till he came to the forbidden door and seeing it open he entered and found the Prince lying a-swoon under a tree. He fetched scented waters and sprinkled them on his face, whereupon he revived and turned——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Tenth Night, She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Shaykh Nasr saw Janshah lying a-swoon under the tree he fetched him somewhat of scented waters and sprinkled them on his face. Thereupon he revived and turned right and left, but seeing none by him save the Shaykh, sighed heavily and repeated these couplets:— “Like fullest moon she shines on happiest night, ✿ Soft-sided fair, with slender shape bedight. Her eye-babes charm the world with gramarye; ✿ Her lips remind of rose and ruby light. Her jetty locks make night upon her hips; ✿ Ware, lovers, ware ye of that curl’s despight! Yea, soft her sides are, but in love her heart ✿ Out-hardens flint, surpasses syenite: And bows of eyebrows shower glancey shafts ✿ Despite the distance never fail to smite. Then, ah, her beauty! all the fair it passes; ✿ Nor any rival her who see the light.” When Shaykh Nasr heard these verses, he said, “O my son, did I not warn thee not to open that door and enter that room? But now, O my son, tell me what thou sawest therein and acquaint me with all that betided thee.” So Janshah related to him all that had passed between him and the three maidens, and Shaykh Nasr, who sat listening in silence said, “Know, O my son, that these three maidens are of the daughters of the Jann and come hither every year for a day, to divert themselves and make merry until mid-afternoon, when they return to their own country.” Janshah asked, “And where is their country?”; and the old man answered, “By Allah, O my son, I wot not:” presently adding, “but now take heart and put away this love from thee and come with me, that I may send thee to thine own land with the birds.” When Janshah heard this, he gave a great cry and fell down in a trance; and presently he came to himself, and said, “O my father, indeed I care not to return to my native land: all I want is to foregather with these maidens and know, O my father, that I will never again name my people, though I die before thee.” Then he wept and cried, “Enough for me that I look upon the face of her I love, although it be only once in the year!” And he sighed deeply and repeated these couplets:— Would Heaven the Phantom[548] spared the friend at night ✿ And would this love for man were ever dight! Were not my heart a-fire for love of you, ✿ Tears ne’er had stained my cheeks nor dimmed my sight. By night and day, I bid my heart to bear ✿ Its griefs, while fires of love my body blight. Then he fell at Shaykh Nasr’s feet and kissed them and wept sore, crying, “Have pity on me, so Allah take pity on thee and aid me in my strait so Allah aid thee!” Replied the old man, “By Allah, O my son, I know nothing of these maidens nor where may be their country; but, O my son, if thy heart be indeed set on one of them, tarry with me till this time next year for they will assuredly reappear; and, when the day of their coming draweth near, hide thyself under a tree in the garden. As soon as they have alighted and doffed their feather-robes and plunged into the lake and are swimming about at a distance from their clothes, seize the vest of her whom thy soul desireth. When they see thee, they will come a-bank and she, whose coat thou hast taken, will accost thee and say to thee with the sweetest of speech and the most witching of smiles, “Give me my dress, O my brother, that I may don it and veil my nakedness withal.” But if thou yield to her prayer and give her back the vest thou wilt never win thy wish: nay, she will don it and fly away to her folk and thou wilt nevermore see her again. Now when thou hast gained the vest, clap it under thine armpit and hold it fast, till I return from the Parliament of the Fowls, when I will make accord between thee and her and send thee back to thy native land, and the maiden with thee. And this, O my son, is all I can do for thee, nothing more.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Eleventh Night, She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth Shaykh Nasr to Janshah, “Hold fast the feather-robe of her thy soul desireth and give it not back to her till I return from the Parliament of the Fowls. And this, O my son, is all I can do for thee, nothing more.” When Janshah heard this, his heart was solaced and he abode with Shaykh Nasr yet another year, counting the days as they passed until the day of the coming of the birds. And when at last the appointed time arrived the old man said to him, “Do as I enjoined thee and charged thee with the maidens in the matter of the feather-dress, for I go to meet the birds;” and Janshah replied, “I hear and I obey, O my father.” Then the Shaykh departed whilst the Prince walked into the garden and hid himself under a tree, where none could see him. Here he abode a first day and a second and a third, but the maidens came not; whereat he was sore troubled and wept and sighed from a heart hard tried; and he ceased not weeping and wailing till he fainted away. When he came to himself, he fell to looking now at the basin and now at the welkin, and anon at the earth and anon at the open country, whilst his heart grieved for stress of love-longing. As he was in this case, behold, the three doves appeared in the firmament, eagle-sized as before, and flew till they reached the garden and lighted down beside the basin. They turned right and left; but saw no one, man or Jann; so they doffed their feather-suits and became three maidens. Then they plunged into the basin and swam about, laughing and frolicking; and all were mother-naked and fair as bars of virgin silver. Quoth the eldest, “O my sister, I fear lest there be some one lying ambushed for us in the pavilion.” Answered the second, “O sister, since the days of King Solomon, none hath entered the pavilion, be he man or Jann;” and the youngest added, laughing, “By Allah, O my sisters, if there be any hidden there, he will assuredly take none but me.” Then they continued sporting and laughing and Janshah’s heart kept fluttering for stress of passion: but he hid behind the tree so that he saw without being seen. Presently they swam out to the middle of the basin leaving their clothes on the bank. Hereupon he sprang to his feet, and running like the darting leven to the basin’s brink, snatched up the feather-vest of the youngest damsel, her on whom his heart was set and whose name was Shamsah the Sun-maiden. At this the girls turned and seeing him, were affrighted and veiled their shame from him in the water. Then they swam near shore and looking on his favour saw that he was bright faced as the moon on the night of fullness and asked him, “Who art thou and how camest thou hither and why hast thou taken the clothes of the lady Shamsah?”; and he answered, “Come hither to me and I will tell you my tale.” Quoth Shamsah, “What deed is this, and why hast thou taken my clothes, rather than those of my sisters?” Quoth he, “O light of mine eyes, come forth of the water, and I will recount thee my case and acquaint thee why I chose thee out.” Quoth she, “O my lord and coolth of my eyes and fruit of my heart, give me my clothes, that I may put them on and cover my nakedness withal; then will I come forth to thee.” But he replied, “O Princess of beautiful ones, how can I give thee back thy clothes and slay myself for love-longing? Verily, I will not give them to thee, till Shaykh Nasr, the king of the birds, shall return.” Quoth she, “If thou wilt not give me my clothes withdraw a little apart from us, that my sisters may land and dress themselves and lend me somewhat wherewithal to cover my shame.” “I hear and obey,” answered he, and walked away from them into the pavilion, whereupon the three Princesses came out and the two elder, donning their dress, gave Shamsah somewhat thereof, not enough to fly withal, and she put it on and came forth of the water, and stood before him, as she were the rising full-moon or a browsing gazelle. Then Shamsah entered the pavilion, where Janshah was still sitting on the throne; so she saluted him and taking seat near him, said, “O fair of face, thou hast undone thyself and me; but tell us thy adventures that we may ken how it is with thee.” At these words he wept till he drenched his dress with his tears; and when she saw that he was distracted for love of her, she rose and taking him by the hand, made him sit by her side and wiped away the drops with her sleeve; and said she, “O fair of face, leave this weeping and tell us thy tale.” So he related to her all that had befallen him and described to her all he had seen,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Twelfth Night, She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the lady Shamsah said to Janshah, “Tell us thy tale;” so he related to her all that had befallen him; and, after she had lent attentive ear she sighed and said, “O my lord, since thou art so fondly in love with me, give me my dress, that I may fly to my folk, I and my sisters, and tell them what affection thou hast conceived for me, and after I will come back to thee and carry thee to thine own country.” When he heard this, he wept sore and replied, “Is it lawful to thee before Allah to slay me wrongfully?” She asked, “O my lord, why should I do such wrongous deed?”; and he answered, “If I give thee thy gear thou wilt fly away from me, and I shall die forthright.” Princess Shamsah laughed at this and so did her sisters; then said she to him, “Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, for I must needs marry thee.” So saying, she bent down to him and embraced him and pressing him to her breast kissed him between the eyes and on his cheeks. They clipped and clasped each other awhile, after which they drew apart and sat down on the throne. Then the eldest Princess went out into the garden and, plucking somewhat of fruits and flowers, brought them into the pavilion; and they ate and drank and laughed and sported and made merry. Now Janshah was singular in beauty and loveliness and slender shape and symmetry and grace, and the Princess Shamsah said to him, “O my beloved, by Allah, I love thee with exceeding love and will never leave thee!” When he heard her words, his breast broadened and he laughed for joy till he showed his teeth; and they abode thus awhile in mirth and gladness and frolic. And when they were at the height of their pleasure and joyance, behold, Shaykh Nasr returned from the Parliament of the Fowls and came in to them; whereupon they all rose to him and saluted him and kissed his hands. He gave them welcome and bade them be seated. So they sat down and he said to Princess Shamsah, “Verily this youth loveth thee with exceeding love; Allah upon thee, deal kindly with him, for he is of the great ones of mankind and of the sons of the kings, and his father ruleth over the land of Kabul and his reign compasseth a mighty empire.” Quoth she, “I hear and I obey thy behest”; and, kissing the Shaykh’s hands, stood before him in respect. Quoth he, “If thou say sooth, swear to me by Allah that thou wilt never betray him, what while thou abidest in the bonds of life.” So she swore a great oath that she would never betray Janshah, but would assuredly marry him, and added, “Know, O Shaykh Nasr, that I never will forsake him.” The Shaykh believed in her oath and said to Janshah, “Thanks be to Allah, who hath made you arrive at this understanding!” Hereupon the Prince rejoiced with exceeding joy, and he and Shamsah abode three months with Shaykh Nasr, feasting and toying and making merry.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Thirteenth Night, She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, Janshah and the lady Shamsah abode three months with Shaykh Nasr, feasting and toying and making merry. And at the end of that time she said to Janshah, “I wish to go with thee to thy motherland, where thou shalt marry me and we will abide there.” “To hear is to obey,” answered he and took counsel with Shaykh Nasr, who said to him, “Go thou home, I commend her to thy care.” Then said she, “O Shaykh Nasr, bid him render me my feather-suit.” So the Shaykh bade Janshah give it to her, and he went straightways into the pavilion and brought it out for her. Thereupon she donned it and said to him, “Mount my back and shut thine eyes and stop thine ears, so thou mayst not hear the roar of the revolving sphere; and keep fast hold of my feathers, lest thou fall off.” He did as she bade him and, as she stretched her wings to fly, Shaykh Nasr said, “Wait a while till I describe to thee the land Kabul, lest you twain miss your way.” So she delayed till he had said his say and had bidden them farewell, commending the Prince to her care. She took leave of her sisters and bade them return to her folk and tell them what had befallen her with Janshah; then, rising into the air without stay or delay she flew off, like the wafts of the wind or the lamping leven. Her sisters also took flight and returning home delivered her message to their people. And she stayed not her course from the forenoon till the hour of mid-afternoon prayer (Janshah being still on her back), when she espied afar off a Wady abounding in trees and streams and she said to Janshah, “I am thinking to alight in this valley, that we may solace ourselves amongst its trees and herbage and here rest for the night.” Quoth he, “Do what seemeth meet to thee!” So she swooped down from the lift and alighted in the Wady, when Janshah dismounted and kissing her between the eyes,[549] sat with her awhile on the bank of a river there; then they rose and wandered about the valley, taking their pleasure therein and eating of the fruits of the trees, until nightfall, when they lay down under a tree and slept till the morning dawned. As soon as it was day, the Princess arose and, bidding Janshah mount, flew on with him till noon, when she perceived by the appearance of the buildings which Shaykh Nasr had described to her, that they were nearing the city Kabul. So she swooped down from the welkin and alighted in a wide plain, a blooming champaign, wherein were gazelles straying and springs playing and rivers flowing and ripe fruits growing. So Janshah dismounted and kissed her between the eyes; and she asked him, “O my beloved and coolth of mine eyes, knowest thou how many days’ journey we have come since yesterday?”; and he answered, “No,” when she said, “We have come thirty months’ journey.” Quoth he, “Praised be Allah for safety!” Then they sat down side by side and ate and drank and toyed and laughed. And whilst they were thus pleasantly engaged, behold, there came up to them two of the King’s Mamelukes of those who had been of the Prince’s company; one of them was he whom he had left with the horses, when he embarked in the fishing-boat and the other had been of his escort in the chase. As soon as they saw Janshah, both knew him and saluted him; then said they, “With thy leave, we will go to thy sire and bear him the glad tidings of thy coming.” Replied the Prince, “Go ye to my father and acquaint him with my case, and fetch us tents, for we will tarry here seven days to rest ourselves till he make ready his retinue to meet us, that we may enter in stateliest state.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Fourteenth Night, She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Janshah said to the two Mamelukes, “Go ye to my sire and acquaint him with my case and fetch us tents, for we will abide here seven days to rest ourselves, till he make ready his retinue to meet us, that we may enter in the stateliest state.” So the officers hastened back to King Teghmus and said to him, “Good news, O King of the age!” Asked he, “What good tidings bring ye: is my son Janshah come back?”; and they answered, “Yes, thy son Janshah hath returned from his strangerhood and is now near at hand in the Kirání mead.” Now when the King heard this, he joyed with great joy and fell down in a swoon for excess of gladness; then, coming to himself, he bade his Wazir give each of the Mamelukes a splendid suit of honour and a sum of money. The minister replied, “I hear and obey,” and forthright did his bidding and said to them, “Take this in turn for the good tidings ye bring, whether ye lie or say sooth.” They replied, “Indeed we lie not, for but now we sat with him and saluted him and kissed his hands and he bade us fetch him tents, for that he would sojourn in the meadow seven days, till such time as the Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees should come out to meet him.” Quoth the King, “How is it with my son?” and quoth they, “He hath with him a Houri, as he had brought her out of Paradise.” At this, King Teghmus bade beat the kettledrums and sound the trumpets for gladness, and despatched messengers to announce the good news to Janshah’s mother and to the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Lords of the realm: so the criers spread themselves about the city and acquainted the people with the coming of Prince Janshah. Then the King made ready, and, setting out for the Kirani meadow with his horsemen and footmen, came upon Janshah who was sitting at rest with the lady Shamsah beside him and, behold, all suddenly drew in sight. The Prince rose to his feet and walked forward to meet them; and the troops knew him and dismounted, to salute him and kiss his hands: after which he set out preceded by the men in single file till he came to his sire, who, at sight of his son threw himself from his horse’s back and clasped him to his bosom and wept flooding tears of joy. Then they took horse again with the retinue riding to the right and left and fared forward till they came to the river-banks; when the troops alighted and pitched their tents and pavilions and standards to the blare of trump and the piping of fife and the dub-a-dub of drum and tom-tom. Moreover the King bade the tent-pitchers set up a pavilion of red silk for the Princess Shamsah, who put off her scanty raiment of feathers for fine robes and, entering the pavilion, there took seat. And as she sat in her beauty, behold, the King and his son Janshah came in to her, and when she saw Teghmus, she rose and kissed ground before him. The King sat down and seating Janshah on his right hand and Princess Shamsah on his left, bade her welcome and said to his son, “Tell me all that hath befallen thee in this thy long strangerhood.” So Janshah related to him the whole of his adventures from first to last, whereat he marvelled with exceeding marvel and turning to the Princess, said, “Laud to Allah for that He hath caused thee to reunite me with my son! ‘Verily this is of His exceeding bounty!’”[550]——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Fifteenth Night, She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Teghmus said to the lady Shamsah, “Laud to Allah for that He hath caused thee to reunite me with my son! ‘Verily this is of His exceeding bounty.’ And now I would have thee ask of me what thou wilt, that I may do it in thine honour.” Quoth she, “I ask of thee that thou build me a palace in the midst of a flower-garden, with water running under it.” And the King answered, “I hear and obey.” And behold, up came Janshah’s mother, attended by all the wives of the Wazirs and Emirs and nobles and city notables. When her son had sight of her, he rose and leaving the tent, went forth to meet her and they embraced a long while, whilst the Queen wept for excess of joy and with tears trickling from her eyes repeated the following verses:— Joy so o’ercometh me, for stress of joy ✿ In that which gladdeneth me I fain shed tears:— Tears are become your nature, O my eyes, ✿ Who weep for joyance as for griefs and fears. And they complained to each other of all their hearts had suffered from the long separation. Then the King departed to his pavilion and Janshah carried his mother to his own tent, where they sat talking till there came up some of the lady Shamsah’s attendants who said, “The Princess is now walking hither in order to salute thee.” When the Queen heard this, she rose and going to meet Shamsah, saluted her and seated her awhile by her side. Presently the Queen and her retinue of noble women, the spouses of the Emirs and Grandees, returned with Princess Shamsah to the tent occupied by her daughter-in-law and sat there. Meanwhile, King Teghmus gave great largesse to his levies and lieges and rejoiced in his son with exceeding joy, and they tarried there ten days, feasting and merry-making and living a most joyous life. At the end of this time, the King commanded a march and they all returned to the capital, so he took horse surrounded by all the troops with the Wazirs and Chamberlains to his right and left: nor ceased they faring till they entered the city, which was decorated after the goodliest fashion; for the folk had adorned the houses with precious stuffs and jewellery and spread costly brocades under the hoofs of the horses. The drums beat for glad tidings and the Grandees of the kingdom rejoiced and brought rich gifts and the lookers on were filled with amazement. Furthermore, they fed the mendicants and Fakirs and held high festival for the space of ten days, and the lady Shamsah joyed with exceeding joy whenas she saw this. Then King Teghmus summoned architects and builders and men of art and bade them build a palace in that garden. So they straightway proceeded to do his bidding; and, when Janshah knew of his sire’s command, he caused the artificers to fetch a block of white marble and carve it and hollow it in the semblance of a chest; which being done, he took the feather-vest of Princess Shamsah wherewith she had flown with him through the air: then, sealing the cover with melted lead, he ordered them to bury the box in the foundations and build over it the arches whereon the palace was to rest. They did as he bade them, nor was it long before the palace was finished: then they furnished it and it was a magnificent edifice, standing in the midst of the garden, with streams flowing under its walls.[551] Upon this the King caused Janshah’s wedding to be celebrated with the greatest splendour and they brought the bride to the castle in state procession and went their ways. When the lady Shamsah entered, she smelt the scent of her feather-gear——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Sixteenth Night, She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the lady Shamsah entered the new palace, she smelt the scent of her flying feather-gear and knew where it was and determined to take it. So she waited till midnight, when Janshah was drowned in sleep; then she rose and going straight to the place where the marble-coffer was buried under the arches she hollowed the ground alongside till she came upon it; when she removed the lead wherewith it was soldered and, taking out the feather-suit, put it on. Then she flew high in air and perching on the pinnacle of the palace, cried out to those who were therein, saying, “I pray you fetch me Janshah, that I may bid him farewell.” So they told him and he came out and, seeing her on the terrace-roof of the palace, clad in her feather-raiment, asked her, “Why hast thou done this deed?”; and she answered “O my beloved and coolth of mine eyes and fruit of my heart, by Allah, I love thee passing dear and I rejoice with exceeding joy in that I have restored thee to thy friends and country and thou hast seen thy mother and father. And now, if thou love me as I love thee, come to me at Takní, the Castle of Jewels.” So saying, she flew away forthright to find her family and friends, and Janshah fell down fainting, being well-nigh dead for despair. They carried the news to King Teghmus, who mounted at once and riding to the palace, found his son lying senseless on the ground; whereat he wept knowing that the swoon was caused by the loss of his love, and sprinkled rose-water on his face.[552] When the Prince came to himself and saw his sire sitting at his head, he wept at the thought of losing his wife and the King asked what had befallen him. So he replied, “Know, O my father, that the lady Shamsah is of the daughters of the Jann and she hath done such and such” (telling him all that had happened); and the King said, “O my son, be not troubled and thus concerned, for I will assemble all the merchants and wayfarers in the land and enquire of them anent that castle. If we can find out where it is, we will journey thither and demand the Princess Shamsah of her people; and we hope in Allah the Almighty that He will give her back to thee and thou shalt consummate thy marriage.” Then he went out and, calling his four Wazirs without stay or delay, bade them assemble all the merchants and voyagers in the city and question them of Takni, the Castle of Jewels, adding, “Whoso knoweth it and can guide us thither, I will surely give him fifty thousand gold pieces.” The Wazirs accordingly went forth at once and did as the King bade them, but neither trader nor traveller could give them news of Takni, the Castle of Jewels; so they returned and told the King. Thereupon he bade bring beautiful slave-girls and concubines and singers and players upon instruments of music, whose like are not found but with the Kings: and sent them to Janshah, so haply they might divert him from the love of the lady Shamsah. Moreover, he despatched couriers and spies to all the lands and islands and climes, to enquire for Takni, the Castle of Jewels, and they made quest for it two months long, but none could give them news thereof. So they returned and told the King, whereupon he wept bitter tears and going in to his son found Janshah sitting amidst the concubines and singers and players on harp and zither and so forth, not one of whom could console him for the lady Shamsah. Quoth Teghmus, “O my son, I can find none who knoweth this Castle of Jewels; but I will bring thee a fairer than she.” When Janshah heard this, his eyes ran over with tears and he recited these two couplets:— Patience hath fled, but passion fareth not; ✿ And all my frame with pine is fever-hot: When will the days my lot with Shamsah join? ✿ Lo, all my bones with passion-lowe go rot! Now there was a deadly feud between King Teghmus and a certain King of Hind, by name Kafíd, who had great plenty of troops and warriors and champions; and under his hand were a thousand puissant chieftains, each ruling over a thousand tribes whereof every one could muster four thousand cavaliers. He reigned over a thousand cities each guarded by a thousand forts and he had four Wazirs and under him ruled Emirs, Princes and Sovereigns; and indeed he was a King of great might and prowess whose armies filled the whole earth. Now King Teghmus had made war upon him and ravaged his reign and slain his men and of his treasures had made gain. But when it came to King Kafid’s knowledge that King Teghmus was occupied with the love of his son, so that he neglected the affairs of the state and his troops were grown few and weak by reason of his care and concern for his son’s state, he summoned his Wazirs and Emirs and said to them, “Ye all know that whilom King Teghmus invaded our dominions and plundered our possessions and slew my father and brethren, nor indeed is there one of you, but he hath harried his lands and carried off his goods and made prize of his wives and slain some kinsmen of his. Now I have heard this day that he is absorbed in the love of his son Janshah, and that his troops are grown few and weak; and this is the time to take our blood-revenge on him. So make ready for the march and don ye your harness of battle; and let nothing stay or delay you, and we will go to him and fall upon him and slay him and his son, and possess ourselves of his reign.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. Now when it was the Five Hundred and Seventeenth Night, She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kafid, King of Hind, commanded his troops and armies to mount and make for the dominions of King Teghmus, saying, “Get ye ready for the march and don ye your harness of war; and let nothing stay or delay you; so we will go to him and fall upon him and slay him and his son and possess ourselves of his reign.” They all answered with one voice, saying, “We hear and obey,” and fell at once to equipping themselves and levying troops; and they ceased not their preparations for three months and, when all was in readiness, they beat the drums and sounded the trumps and flew the flags and banners: then King Kafid set out at the head of his host and they fared on till they reached the frontiers of the land of Kabul, the dominions of King Teghmus, where they began to harry the land and do havoc among the folk, slaughtering the old and taking the young prisoners. When the news reached King Teghmus, he was wroth with exceeding wrath and assembling his Grandees and officers of state, said to them, “Know that Kafid hath come to our land and hath entered the realm we command and is resolved to fight us hand to hand; and he leadeth troops and champions and warriors, whose number none knoweth save Allah Almighty; what deme deem ye?” Replied they, “O King of the age, let us go out to him and give him battle and drive him forth of our country; and thus deem we.” So he bade them prepare for battle and brought forth to them hauberks and cuirasses and helmets and swords and all manner of warlike gear, such as lay low warriors and do to death the champions of mankind. So the troops and braves and champions flocked together and they set up the standards and beat the drums and sounded the trumpets and clashed the cymbals and piped on the pipes; and King Teghmus marched out at the head of his army, to meet the hosts of Hind. And when he drew near the foe, he called a halt, and encamping with his host in the Zahrán Valley,[553] hard by the frontier of Kabul despatched to King Kafid by messenger the following letter:—“Know that what thou hast done is of honest, as fun as birthdays are, we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today." This is really cool. - Right? I was just thinking... - No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun. Right! Exactly. Knew I could count on you. Good a spot as any. What are you doing? Stop it. Dwight, Dwight. Just... - I'm just... - Stop. - Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. Behold. - Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight. - Here's your knife. - Thank you. - And here's your duct tape. Alright, very good. - Good luck, Michael. - Thanks for the ride. Leave me be, Dwight. - Jim, can I have my own cake? - What's that? I really prefer devils food cake. - Oh, sure. - Yes! Wow! That was easy. Yeah, people like me, I guess. - I hate devils food. - Well I think Meredith was just... Screw Meredith. I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday. - Everybody's birthday. - Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake. - What do you want? - I want pie. I want peach pie. - You want a birthday pie? I want a nice cobbler. I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie. I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen. - It will be Angela. - You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means. Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. There we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here... I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity. There we go. Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts. I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. See, this is a beautiful piece of material. This could be used for all sorts of things. Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable. - Tuna. - Andy. Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? - Fudgey the Whale. - Not your birthday. Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgey the Whale. Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no. Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up. Andy, I have some calls to make. - Loud and clear. - Alright. Pizza rolls. OK, I'm gonna go into this office here to do some work. - So I will be in here. - Mushroom caps. I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter. Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. I hope he finds it. Lunch. Well, it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious. About two more minutes. I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. It's Creed's birthday today. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday, dear Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy. What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them? Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break. I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die. - Why don't you just have an apple? - Why don't you mind your business? Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care. - Probably went to his head. - Yeah. Hey guys, what're we talking about? Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon, gang. Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day. Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... on. Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea. - Oh, thanks man. - Yeah... - Is there anything...? - My birthday was two months ago. - There was no party. - What? Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for... 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot. - I remember that. - I don't know, I just thought... you could include me. - Seriously? I just though you could add me. I don't see the harm in that. Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. "I don't see the harm in that." Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon. OK. Yeah, you know what? , we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right? No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgey the Whale, mushroom caps. I'm allergic to mushrooms. That's a bummer. OK, then we need to... Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please? 'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing. - Conference room? - Yes, conference room in 5 minutes. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it. What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie? I'll take 'em. Well nobody's touching my cobbler. Hey, Michael. I mean Jim. Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact. Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. Get them out. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday, dear Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Yeah! Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want... Alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something. Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. I can also make it the sky. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. What up? Sure glad you're back. - You are relieved. - You have no idea. So what did I miss? Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once. Terrible idea. Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake. You did do it? Just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out. I don't think I'll be here in ten years. That's what I said. That's what she said. That's what who said? I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. - When things sort of get hard. - That's what she said. Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward. I really didn't think I was gonna have a good time but I did. I love camping. ¶ Anything can happen ¶ Well it wasn't camping. It was more of a wilderness retreat. - Morning. - Michael. Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a "get to know you" weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him. Did you sleep in cabins? Under the stars. It was really beautiful. You should've come. Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited. - Who went? - Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany, and Ryan obviously. We had so many s'mores I finally had to say, "no more s'mores, no more s'mores." Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful... Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point so just... wrap it up. Michael wasn't invited. T Transcript Transcript : Transcript : SwSub Synchro Transcript : SwSub Synchro : Episode 4x07 "SURVIVOR MAN" (1.00) Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping... And you know what "hypothetical" means? - Not real. - Got it. So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, - would you go? - Absolutely, yes. When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes. - Really? - Yeah. Do you wanna go today? And I am always busy. Oh, can't go today 'cause I'm donating blood. How often can you actually donate blood? Is there a limit? I don't... Your body only has a certain amount. Well is that it, or... Yeah, just this whole Toby camping thing. I don't know. It seems a little lame. - How so? - A bunch of guys in a tent making s'mores? - What's that? - Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. Here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping... by yourself in the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys if your plans change. - Not gonna change. - I want to do it myself. I want to go... and find out something about myself. I want to get out of here. All the cliques and the office politics. Fluorescent lights and the asbestos. - I thought we had that looked at. - I'm sick of this place, Jim. When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called Survivorman, and... it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out into the middle of nowhere and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal or... be overexposed. Okay, I will only need two things: a roll of duct tape and a knife. - I'm on it. - Okay. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipt. - Hey, what... - Let's see if any of these will work. I keep various weaponry strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the workplace." Well I say it's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally than by a stranger on purpose. Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow and perhaps the next day. Do you want me to ask where you're going? - No. - Great. Dwight'll be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness... Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. - The choice is yours. - No. The choice is actually yours. - Are you sure you wanna do this? - Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. - Don't try to follow me. - Great. This is a very personal, private experience in the wild that I wish to share - with me, myself, and I. - Yep. When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being. That'd be great. Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostel environment? Let's put it this way. No, I do not. This is what a true survivorman does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You can only wear the clothes that you have on. And you can only use the stuff that you have in your pockets. Now in this case, this disaster is a serial killer, creepy guy who's abducted me, and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead. I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape. Well yes, I would and I would survive. I'ld make sure that you were dead, believe me. Then I'ld remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you couldn't be identified. And they would call me the overkill killer. You are as creepy as a real serial killer. - For real. Okay... - What are you doing? I'm putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we... - What are you doing? - It'ld be better if you're unconscious. God! Dwight, stop it! Stop it! Do you want to do this right or not? Please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life? Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday. Wasn't it just someone's birthday? Yes, Kelly's was last week, remember? - I do remember, yeah. - It's birthday month. Creed's is today, Oscar's is week after next, Meredith's is at the end of the month. Michael usually goes with red an... You know what? I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party? What? There are 13 people working in this office. So 13 times a year, Michael gets a cake and balloons and... some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. And there are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are. Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug. And the other is something inappropriate... or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to Happy birthday. And he is a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even arguably, possibly to a fault. Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! So I think, yeah... I think getting these out of the way might be productive. We can just have one big fun party. And everybody's happy and nobody wastes their time. I don't like it. You're shaking things up a bit, huh? - It's a pretty good idea, uh? - You think it's a good idea? No... I think it's a great idea. We're here. Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out. Here we go. Just the two of us. Here we go into the wild to the mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature? Keep going. You're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets. Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it. Try sending them another invoice. - Okay. - All right. Oh, did you see my memo, by the way? "Let's be honest. As fun as birthday's are "we all could use a break from the constant cake. "So let's celebrate birthday month in style today." This is really... cool. - Right? - Yeah. I was just think... No, totally. Totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun. Right! Exactly. I knew I could count on you. This is as good a spot as any. What are you doing? - Stop it. Dwight, just stop it! - I'm just... Spin... I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction! Behold. Good. Thank you, Dwight. - Here's your knife. - Thank you. - And here's your duct tape. - Good. - All right. - Very good. Okay. Yep. - Good luck, Michael. - Thanks for the ride. Okay... Leave me be, Dwight. Hey Jim, can I have my own cake? - What's that? - I really prefer devil's food cake. Oh, sure. - Yes, awesome! - Okay. - That was easy. - People like me I guess. Jim. - I hate devil's food. - I think Meredith... Screw Meredith. It's not fair someone else pick the cake on my birthday. - Everybody's birthday. - Today is my birthday - and I wanna pick the cake. - What you want? I want pie. I want peach pie. I want a nice cobbler. I'm gonna talk to Angela to see what we can do. No matter who you talk to, make it happen. - It'll be Angela. - You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means. Day one. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape in case I need to fashion a shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant which would make it about... 2:00 in the afternoon. Really beating down on me now. And I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. Okay. Oh, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my carotid artery here. I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support. But I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity. There we go. Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts. I'm going to wear what was once... one of my pant legs. See this is a beautiful piece of material. This could be used for all sorts of things. Some sort of kerchief... to keep my neck nice and comfortable. - Tuna. - Andy. Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? - "Fudgey the whale." - Not your birthday. Well I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a fudgey the whale. All right. Gonna look into it. But the answer's no. Wow, okay. Harsh. Just don't expect me to show up. Hey Andy, I have some calls to make. - Loud and clear. - All right. - Pizza rolls. - I'm gonna go into this office here to do some work so I will be in here. Mushroom caps. I am totally alone right now with only my thoughts. I love it. ¶ I'm lovin' it ¶ I can literally say anything I want. No one is going to hear me. Wish I could've gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I- have-hemorrhoids! Doesn't even matter. Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. But I hope he finds it. Lunch. Well it is a little chillier than I had thought so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in. It's time for me to find some nourishment. Now these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like... squirrels. A nice, juicy rabbit would be delicious. About two more minutes. I have made this spear with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good... three hours or so. Starting to feel it a little bit. It's Creed's birthday today. ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ ¶ Happy birthday dear Cre-ed ¶ ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ Happy birthday, buddy. What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday. So what if there's a lot of them. Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break. I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die. - Why don't you have an apple? - Why don't you mind your business? Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago so he doesn't care. - I think the power went to his head. - Hey, Jim! - Hey guys, what are we talking about? - Nothing. Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. Come on, gang. Well if you take a look at this... I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy may be Dunder Mifflin paper someday. Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... on. - Hey, Jim. - Toby. Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea. Oh, thanks, man. Yeah. Is there anything I can... My birthday was two months ago. - Oh, okay. - There was no party. - What? - Well... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot. Mmm, I remember that. I just thought, maybe you could... - include me. - Seriously? I just thought you could add me in. I don't know what the harm in that is. Toby's great. He's great. But sometimes he can be a little bit much. "I don't see the harm in that." Well it's a cake, Toby. So, come on. You know what? We're gonna throw you in because the more the merrier. No, no way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't change plans willie-nillie and expect this little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devil's food, peach cobbler, "fudgey the whale," mushroom caps... I'm allergic to mushrooms. That's a bummer. Okay... Then we need to... Hey, everybody. Hi, how are you doing? Can I have your attention? We've to talk about this birthday thing. - Conference room? - Yes, conference room. Five minutes. No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're gonna talk about it out here. So who has problems with the birthday thing? One, two, three... Everybody. Okay, so then we just shouldn't do it. What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie? - Ooh, I'll take 'em! - Well nobody's touching my cobbler. Hey Michael... I mean Jim. Yep, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact. Under this tree, I think I struck the motherload. Those are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say, these little buggers are damn tasty as well. No! No, Michael! No! Give 'em up! ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ ¶ Happy birthday dear Creed ¶ ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ Yeah! ¶ Skip around the room ¶ ¶ Skip around the room ¶ ¶ We won't... ¶ Okay, all right. Yike, don't to that. You're gonna break something. Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he like to have warmth and clothing and television and hamburgers and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air because I have the freshest air around: A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. I can also make it the sky. - Hi, buddy. - Hey. Word up. Sure glad you're back. You are relieved. You have no idea. So what did I miss? Well I tried to put all the birthdays together at once. - So... terrible idea. - Yeah. Okay, I did that. Rookie mistake. - You did do it? - Yeah. Just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out. Well I don't think I'll be here in ten years, but... That's what I said. That's what she said! - That's what who says? - I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension when things sort of get hard. That's what she said. Hey! Nice! Really good. Bravo, my young ward. Coat! Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his Netflix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow. Steak! Where's my steak? He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character. Get me Armani. A suit? On the phone. Like the main company number? 'Cause I'm gonna have to call information. Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You're not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you. I owe you an apology. You finished the movie. Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you. No. Go ahead. Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyway, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, minooshka. Minooshka. Mo cuishle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby. He's gonna try to kill me. So this one goes with my eyes, and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes. You do. I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine. Well, they both go with the carpet that I've ordered, and if we go with the brown leather on the sofas then they go with that, too. We already have a sofa so why are... A futon's not a sofa. It folds up. You've only seen it flat. I know what a futon is, Michael. I... Okay. How much is this gonna cost? It costs what it costs. No. That doesn't even mean anything. We have gone through this, okay. We have gone through this. Yes. Money has been a little bit tight lately, but at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money-wise. It's just, you know, you say it's gonna cost what it... Yeah? Michael, it's Ryan for you. Conniving little runt. Put him through. Put him through. Yes? Ryan, my man. I sent you an e-mail about the new PowerPoint. Yes. And thank you for sending that to me. I had IT install the updated PowerPoint on your computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using PowerPoint. Okay. Yeah. No, I don't know. I don't know. I think those IT guys messed up. Hold on. I'll get them on the phone. Wait. No. Here it is. Here it is. F'ound it. Sure. I can hold. Dunder Mifflin. Dwight Schrute. Please hold. Schrute F'arms, Guten Tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh, no. I'm sorry. No king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Auf Wiedersehen. Hey, Dwight. None of your business, Jim. You running a bed and breakfast? It is not a BB. Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfast. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them breakfast. Does the Department of Health know about this? I am not telling you anything. Permits are pending. Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin. Hello. I'm looking for a room. Okay. This is a misuse of company phones. It says here you cater to the elderly. Where did you read that? Trip Advisor. Trip Advisor is the lifeblood of the agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you may as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn, one of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see. How many in your party? Two. We offer tours of the fields and of the barn. Perhaps you'd be interested in Mose's table-making demonstration? So, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight. Oh, actually I need the car. Why? F'or improv? Why don't you just pretend that you have a car? Good practice in case you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car. Used to have two cars, traded them in. Now we're down to one. Good economic sense, although the new car's a Porsche, for her. One cardigan. One sleeping cardigan. One sleep apnea mask. What about my cherub figurine? You took that with you. No. I left it on my night... Your night table, by the lamp. You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there. F'ine. My girlfriend and I broke up recently, and I must say I am relieved. It gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his doorstep by his parents. You can use those oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care. They're your oats. The bar uses an applause meter. That's why it is so important that you all come and applaud only for my band, Scrantonicity II. Not Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you? You cannot. I have a thing tonight. Damn it. Michael. What? That reminds me. If the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight. Oh, no. I have a thing tonight. That stinks. Darn it. Shoot. How about this weekend? No. Can't. We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you. Damn it to hell. Okay, all right. What do you got going on tonight? You wouldn't understand. It's a secret. I wouldn't understand or it's a secret? You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret. I'm sorry, Mr. O'Brien. I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in five minutes? How would that sound? Amazing, right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will... It will be that easy. I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but I never thought... The Beets Motel. The Beets Motel? That is... Wow. Thank you. The Borscht Hotel. The Embassy Beets. Radish Inn. How are you doing this? I don't know. Oh, my gosh. I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do enough of it as a manager, so I took this second job kind of as a hobby. Some people have golf or relaxing... What's going on here? Hey. I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call. We're a legit operation with a license from the city. I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commission. Nope. They're with me, so... This is Nick F'igaro, manager to the stars. We have three rooms, each with a different theme. What are the themes? America, Irrigation and Nighttime. Irrigation. Nice. I'll put you down for Irrigation. Now then, do you have any special needs or dietary restrictions? Yes. We will be requiring a bedtime story. No. Not even Harry Potter? No, Jim, come on. - But you promised... - Mose, bags, now. Here we are. Irrigation room. A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here at Schrute F'arms, but as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty. Everybody in the conference room in five minutes. These meetings are useless. I just want to remind you to stick to the script. It's been proven to work, so... Got it? Very inspirational. We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales, okay? Or a woman. Or a trained seal. You can make jokes when you've made a sale there, rookie. Okay? I'd say one in six. What? I thought you asked me what our chances were of being murdered here tonight. You know, I just realized this is Pam's and my first night away together. I used to play it over in my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a nice hotel or a romantic dinner, wine, but wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And I always imagine less manure. I mean some manure, just less. This is beet food. Mose, what are you doing? No, Mose. Put the manure down. Put it down! Do not throw it! Do not... Yes, is Mr. Hudson there? Yeah. Who is this? Well, I'm just calling because you responded positively to... Michael? Stanley? Why are you calling me here at home? Señor, are you happy with your long-distance service? Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home? Have you... Have you considered satellite television? Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. All right. Why are you calling me here at home? When I'm at home, at night, in my own house, in my sweats drinking some red wine, watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole godforsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott. Well, your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy that the coach won't play him, frankly. My office. You bet. Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say those words exactly, got it? I don't know why we have to keep having this conversation. Look, I know sales, and I had that sale. I just needed a few more minutes to... A few more minutes is a waste of our time. It's not a waste of time. This is a trading game. No. Look. You give a quick pitch, you make the sale, you move on. That's how Vikram does it. Vikram doesn't have my people skills. Good for Vikram, because he outsells you every night. No. Well, I hope this conversation has helped. "And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand" "and felt Voldermort's surge of vicious anger." "Saw the frail old man on the floor writhe in agony." "'Harry.' It was over as quickly as it had come." "Harry stood shaking in the darkness," "clutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing." What you got tonight? It looks like mixed masala, eggplant and rice. Oh, that looks good. And what about you? Peanut butter flavor again? I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening. Enjoy. Thank you. I was a surgeon back home. Really? Yeah. Wonder what I would have been back home. Well, this is your home. I know, but it's so competitive here. What's $1 worth in your land? Medical school must have cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something. Uh, no. I would have been chief of surgery. Or a cowboy. Wait, you're going out there? Yeah. Coward. Oh, my God. What century is this? You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard 1, the original, John McClane is just this normal guy, you know? He's just a normal New York City cop who gets his feet cut, and he gets beat up, but he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter in the air. Yeah. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator. Dude, you should review movies. Oh, my God. Yes. I'm telling you. Yeah. You should. I actually wrote a movie. Really? Well, I'm writing one, yeah. What's it about? Sort of a spy thriller. Hey, what's so captivating? I love captivating things, and this must really be captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean, time is your money. That's how I know how captivating it is because of how much time you've spent talking. Your turn. Come in. Did you have another nightmare? Hey, Dwight. Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose. Does Mose have nightmares? Oh, yes. Ever since the storm. Is everything satisfactory with your stay? Yeah. Yeah. Great. Just thought I heard crying or moaning or something in here. Oh, well, I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff. Good night, Dwight. Hey, so we're all gonna go out for a beer. You want to come? We'd love for you to come, Michael. Thanks, no. I have to work in the morning, so... All right. Next time, dude. Okay. See you guys. Hey, how you doing? You drive. I had too much wine. Okay. How was yoga? I didn't go. Why? Why not? I just didn't. Okay. How was improv? Good night, Vikram. Good night. Hey, congrats on the bonus. Thank you, Michael. I'm gonna nab it one of these nights. Well, if you concentrate and make your calls faster, yeah. Good night. Good night. Michael. Mmm. Morning. Hi. Hey, Dwight. How are you? Pam. You okay? I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. Hey, guys. What's happening? How's my favorite branch doing? Okay, Michael, why don't you start us off? Um... That wasn't much of an introduction. Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott. Oh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, today we're going to be talking about PowerPoint. PowerPoint. PowerPoint. PowerPoint. Yes, I forgot about Ryan's presentation, and yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation that he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery. And the best way to start is to hit "Start," and up comes the tool bar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to "Run," and then you look up to "PowerPoint." And we are in. We are going to register. You hit "Register." Updates are ready. I should update. "Estimated time 12 minutes." So this should take about five or 10 minutes. Is this the first time you've opened PowerPoint? Why? You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you? No. I had a really rough night, and my boss can back me up on that. I'm your boss. My other boss, Mr. F'igaro. You have another job? What I do between 5:30 p.m. And 1:00 a.m. Is nobody's business but mine and my other business'. Are you a cocktail waitress? You cannot have a second job if it affects your work here. It won't. It did already. Okay, honestly, it is unlikely that I was gonna figure this out anyway. You're so funny. Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse. I invited him. It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs. This isn't information you need. This information here, yeah, you're right, I don't need this. Okay. Hey, come on. See you later tonight. I got plans later. Okay. Bye, honey. How long until you actually get this presentation ready? Why don't you do the presentation? Honestly... Because I don't want... I mean, you know how to do it. What I really want, honestly, Michael, is for you to know it so that you can communicate it to the people here, to your clients, to whomever. Okay. What? It's whoever, not whomever. No, it's whomever. No. Whomever is never actually right. Well, sometimes it's right. Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students. No. Actually whomever is the formal version of the word. Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly. Not a native speaker. I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night. Do you really know which one is correct? I don't know. It's whom when it's the object of a sentence and who when it's the subject. That sounds right. Well, it sounds right, but is it? How did Ryan use it? As an object? As an object. Ryan used me as an object. Is he right about that? How did he use it again? It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object... Thank you. To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object, which is the correct usage of the word. No one asked you anything, ever. So whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it in your skull? Hey, this doesn't matter, and I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job or you're fired here. I've never done this before. I have never quit anything in my life. So you are filming history. Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full-time jobs. One here at the lipaphadrazone diet pill company. Lipophedrine. And in the other, I was a regional manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin. Never heard of it. In this dream, I did both of these jobs beautifully and I loved it and everybody loved me. The truth is, I can't do this. Are you quitting? I am. Come back anytime. Don't forget to disinfect your headset. I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream, I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep and try it all again the next night. So... What's up? Me. All night. Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body. You're being gross. Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her. I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves. What moves? I have moonwalked past accounting like 10 times. I can't believe that's not working. Yeah. Um... I don't know if I really see you two together. Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain. She's very religious. Okay, well, I come from a line of WASPs so long it leads back to Moses. Okay, well, she takes her convictions pretty seriously. She can be kind of severe. Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall. That's right. You did. Yeah. Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight. Or Angela. Or Andy. Hey, Kevin, you're a gambler, right? A rounder? You play the ponies, small horses? I do gamble, Michael. Yeah. I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, then doubling it several more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have any tips or ideas about sure things? Like a boxer who is gonna throw the big fight? You know, like he's tied into some crooked dealings and maybe his kid is sick or something? Like, who do I call about that? The mob. Do you know anybody in the mob? Okay. Oscar, I'm gonna need to take another advance on my salary. What do you mean you have plans tonight? I have my daughter tonight. We're renting Charlotte's Web. Well, you have to make a choice. It's either your daughter or me. My daughter. Okay. That's how it is. Oops! That was cold. He's always been terrible with money. I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poorhouse. Yeah. Women be shopping. I can't believe he has a second job. He's not even good at his first one. Hey, guys. Shh. What you talking about? Okay. I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, and I think... Michael. Hey, hey, hey. Michael, are you having money problems? Monkey problems? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems? I know you heard me correctly. Oh, I hate monkeys. What's going on? Why do you have a second job? I don't have a second job. Maybe I am having an affair with Suzanne Somers. Doesn't Jan have money? I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude and unsexual. True. It's best to hide our money problems from women. I totally agree with you, but I don't have money problems. All right, you know what? Watch this. If I had money problems, would I do this? Well... You just put it back in your pocket. Yeah. Yeah, but I destroyed it. It's not even useable anymore. Hey, let's call this what it is. It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door. Well, I just need to know where this is going. Hey, I like you. All right? What's not to like? But you need to access your un-crazy side. Otherwise maybe this thing has run its course. Don't you dare walk away from me, Darryl Philbin. You are the most selfish person I have ever met in my entire... Slow down. Think it over. Darryl Philbin is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that? Hey, cuz. Heard you're having money problems. No, you didn't. Listen, I got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away. Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy. When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider. How would that help, Creed? In Monopoly, you go bankrupt, you lose. You don't go by Monopoly, man. That game is nuts. Nobody just picks up Get Out of Jail F'ree cards. Those things cost thousands. That is a good point. Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start. It's a clean slate. Like the witness protection program. Exactly. Not at all. I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. F'resh start. No debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life. I declare bankruptcy! Hey. I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen. I didn't say it. I declared it. Still. That's not anything. This is a lot of credit card debt. Yeah. Tell me about it. You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money. She thinks I'm a human ATM machine. Okay, $125 at Amazon. Oh, best of The Muppet Show on DVD. Classic. $1,200. What's a Core Blaster Extreme? That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stirrups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist and you twist and you twist. It strengthens your entire core, your back core, your arm core, your... The Marine Corps actually uses it. I think that's how they got corps. I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it 'cause I found it outside Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game. Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house. That's so cool how you have my name at the top. The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment. Right. Things like that. This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment. How did you do this so fast? Is this PowerPoint? Oh, man. Angela really had a hold on him. Angela. Michael, I'm gonna set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator. You meet with this guy... No. No. We are going to leave Jan out of this. She has to know. We will find another way. We'll ask PowerPoint. Michael, this is a presentation tool. You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this. I'm done. No, you're not... Okay. Just... You're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could have been a lot worse, but due to some fancy financial footwork, I was able to cut it in half. Jan is smart. She poses. Dwight, how's the hotel business? Stupid. Have you checked Trip Advisor recently? No. Maybe you should. Maybe you should... Whatever. We wrote a good review. Under "Comments," we wrote, "The natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms" "and makes you dream of simpler times." "The dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings." "Table-making never seemed so possible." "You will never want to leave your room." "The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm." I'm glad you enjoyed your stay. We really did. It was fun. So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt. You're broke? How did you get that from what Oscar said? How... I mean, Michael, how did this happen? Where exactly did your money go? I don't... I don't get this. I really don't. I don't... I don't understand how you could be so irresponsible. I mean, it is astounding to me, really. I don't know what more to say, it's just... Jan? Yeah? What? Michael left. Okay. Where did he go? I don't know. Well, is he coming right back? I don't think so. I'll be right there. What am I doing? I am blowing Dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. It feels good. You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign. No bars, no patios, no vegetables and no seafood. Dwight? Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton? Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam. Yeah. I mean, she was with Roy, and I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it, Dwight. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't concentrate on anything. And weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. And it is something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. And that includes you. Hey, I was thinking about dinner, we... Dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place where the dry cleaner used to be. Okay. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Jim's just really passionate about Italian food. Yeah. I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, I'm in love with Italian food. Jan, he went running that way. Okay, great. Thanks. Runaway train, never coming back Run away and I'm never coming back Michael? Hey, Jan. What's going on? Not much. What's up with you? Well, why are you sitting on a train? Where are you going? I am out of answers, Jan. What does that mean? I told you. No more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you. Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won't solve anything. You know that. I don't know that. Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world, electronically. I'll stay off the grid. Michael, come on. Come on. You can deal with this. It's not that bad. Yeah, it is. It is. I really messed up. Well... When... When my life fell apart and they screwed me in New York and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen. That's really nice of you to say. Michael, no. What I want to say is you were there for me, by my side, without even a thought. That's just who you are. I mean, no matter how badly I treat you or what I'm going through, you just... You are there for me, and that is a guy worth staying beside. So where is this train taking us? I... I think the engineer left. Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder Mifflin, and according to our records, you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay. Sure. Yeah. I can take care of that right now. Don't sell your implants, please. I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable, though. It's nice, though. Looks cute. Kind of painful, and my nipples aren't as sensitive now. Looks cute, though. Water... Earth... Fire... Air. Long ago... The four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the fire nation attacked. Only the avatar, master of all four elements could stop them. But when the world needed him most he vanished. 100 years passed and my brother and I discovered the new avatar an airbender named aang. And although his airbending skills were great he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe aang can save the world. I'm losing this war. I'm letting the whole world down. I should have seen this war coming, and prevented it. For so long, I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home now. My dad talks to me. Everything should be perfect, right? I should be happy now, but I'm not. Please, uncle, I'm so confused. I need your help. Forget it. I'll solve this myself. Waste away in here for all I care. Aang, it's time you learned my history with fire lord sozin. You need to understand how the war began if you want to know how to end it. Meet my on my home island on the day of the summer solstice. Ok, roku. You need to know the story of your great-grandfather's demise. It will reveal your own destiny. There it is. That's roku's home. But there's nothing here. Yes, there is. An entire village. Hundreds of houses. All completely buried in ash. It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, zuko. Make sure he gets your good side. Wait. I need to ask you something. What do you remember about our great-grandfather's history? Ah, zuko. It's so strange how your mind works. Fire lord sozin began the war, of course. He spent his early years secretly preparing for it but he was as patient as he was clever. He famously waited for the comet, later renamed sozin's comet and used its power to launch his full-scale invasion of the world. In the end, he died a very old and successful man. But how did he die? Didn't you pay any attention in school, zuko? He died peacefully, in his sleep. He was ancient. What does it mean? The fire sages keep the secret history in the dragon bone catacombs. The final testament of fire lord sozin. Come, aang. Where are we going? To visit my past. Our shared past. As I feel my own life dimming, I can't help but think of a time when everything was so much brighter. I remember my friend. Looks like I win again, roku. Are you kidding? The tree root did all the work. Nice one, sozin. You were friends with fire lord sozin? Back then, he was just prince sozin, and he was my best friend. Say something to her. Uh.... Love is hard when you're young. You don't have to tell me. Don't worry. It gets better. Now come with me. We have a party to attend. Wait, whose party is it? Sozin and I shared many things, including a birthday. Did something happen to my father? No, prince sozin. We are not here for you. We are here to announce the identity of the next avatar. It is our honor to serve you, avatar roku. The had to leave the fire nation and face his destiny as the avatar. He needed to travel the world so he could master the other elements. Hey, why aren't ten coralfish Ginetto brought me. They're terrific! Where did he catch them? In the Procida channel. I don't believe this channel has been offering good seafood lately. Let's make a deal. You taste it. If you don't like them, then throw them away, ok? I've spent my life here and it's never before 5am that I can get to sleep. I'm always sleepy now. Diabetes is to blame. But I'm over it, now. Enough is enough. I'll retire and yield this restaurant. - Why? Have you had any offers? - Each of them worse than the other. It's not the money, cause they've offered me pretty much. But they want to turn it into a pub or a disco. I don't give a damn, but when I pass by, I still want to see that sign "Salvatore a Mare" Salvatore, I was thinking... I'm done with the music. Enough! I don't wanna have anything to do with it anymore. I thought: if you take me as a partner, I could manage the restaurant. Are you serious, Tony? Salvató, if I'm idle at home, I'll go crazy. They'll take me to a madhouse. Maybe, one of these evenings, I could even sing a song or two for the amusement of our friends. What do you say? I just need a deposit, to be safe. Veronica! Go back, go back, you fucking bastards! Go for it! Gigi, Carlo, get closer! Go, Mauri, go! Block him! Yes! Good, Carlo. But you must roll it earlier. You, Biaggio... Ok. - Geppino, give me a hand here. - Sure. Here it is. Antonio, let me show you something. I am the king of Agropoli, Antonio. Look here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 units. 120 row cottages with seaview. We can agree that the Agropoli sea matches the beauty of Sardinia. What I'm saying, Antonio, is why don't you buy one of these cottages? Besides, if you buy it while it's still a project, it'll cost much less. Excuse me, are you following me? Sorry, I was a little distracted. - Are you gazing at Elena? - Her name is Elena? I understand you. Wait here. I know her, I'll introduce you. No, no. Forget it. Geppino, are you still willing to draw up this voucher? Sure. Come to our office on Wednesday. Maybe Thursday is better. It's you then. You said 11, but it's 3 already. I woke up late. Will you really do this to me? Died man, I'm doing you a favor. For this car, the market is as promising as for you. I'm a lawyer. Interesting. And I love theater. But there's not much going on in Ivrea. That's why every now and then I take the car and drive to Turin. - Do you like theater? - Very much. What do you like? I like... I love ballet. It's beautiful. Such an interest is rare among men. You are not superficial. This is quite interesting. You haven't asked me about my job and you never make the conversation slip towards the past. And this makes it even more interesting. It never becomes boring. A very silent person... full of mistery... but your eyes say it all. I think I'm in love with you. In any case, I'm married too... Did you say "in any case"? I'd like to go to Capri with you. Tomorrow. We'll go tomorrow. No, tomorrow is Carnival. A friend of mine is throwing a party. Why don't you come? With pleasure. Where have you learnt to kiss so well? As a boy, when I played for Verona. Hello. Tony, sit down, I have great news. - Shoot it. - A cruiser ship, from Genoa to Cairo, the Red Sea. I'll have you aboard cleaning the toilettes, Tony. You're a real friend. I knew you wouldn't forget me. I told you we only had to wait for the dust to settle down. This ship has a certain level, people with money. It's not the shitty boat trip around the Mediterranean. These are insane cabins. Thank you, Genny, seriously. Tony, I'm your manager. Unfortunately, I can't accept it. What the fuck are you saying, Tony? Are you in trouble? Nothing happened. I just don't know... a whole month at sea. I'm getting old, you know. It'll be crowded and too hot down there. It's really not for me. What the fuck do you mean with "too hot"? It's a lot of money! I don't know, this story with the ship... I see it as a step back. If you have anything better for me, I could consider it, think about it. But this ship would really mean a step back. I appreciate you thought about me, but I have other plans. Tony, you son of a bitch! A step back? ! You're dead, Tony, and I'm trying to get you back to life! Do you know what they said when I mentioned your name? That they didn't want you! That their passengers are middle aged folks, that they don't have junkies or teenagers aboard, that they'd rather have Fred Bongusto. And I was an idiot, telling them you're better than Bongusto, that you gave up the drugs and all that shit, Tony! Don't take it so seriously. Give them Fred. Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch! In my opinion, TV quality has decreased in recent years. I don't agree completely, but we can discuss it. Hi, Lucilla. You look gorgeous. - You too. - Lucilla, my dear. - Thanks for the plants, they were great. - Let's go see them. - How are you? - Fine. Forgive my delay. The traffic was terrible. - I'm coming. - A moment, please. - Yes? Who are you? I'm Antonio Pisapia, a friend of Elena's. Ah, of course. Please. Thanks, my dear. Come in! - I am Lucilla. - It's a pleasure. - Let me take your coat. - Thanks. Oh gee, poor you... I got it. You thought it was a costume party. - It's not. Hasn't Elena told you? - No. - What can we do now? - I'll go home. No, wait. You'll wear something from my husband's wardrobe. Come with me to our room. Wait, the living room is full of guests. I want to make love to you. Now? Yes. I had something else in mind for our first time. The first time can be very disappointing. It might be better to enliven it a little, don't you agree? That's my daughter. Come, we're dancing. Let's go to Capri tomorrow? Yes. I'll wait you there. Lello! Tell the boys... to put the small pastry counter where the aquarium was. The indoor tournament is over. How was it? We won. Yes, but it was a pain the ass, Alberto. I want to coach a real team. I feel I'm ready. Antonio, I must tell you something important. Anything new happened? Trevisani was fired. They called me back in. - And you? - I accepted. I barely got back in and had a fight with the President. And why? Because of you. They won't let me have you as my assistant. Till the end of the championship that stupid Palumbo will have to stay. They say the players have a good connection with him, that we shouldn't disrupt the harmony and this sort of bull shit. It doesn't matter. No, it does matter. I only accepted because they offered me a 2 year contract, assuring me that next year I could bring you in as my assistant. You just have to wait a few months. Let it be. They'll probably change their minds when July comes. No, they won't. Otherwise, I'll quit. I had to accept it, Antonio. It was a load of money. Thus I'll be able to retire in peace. It was the right decision to accept it. Don't be worried about me. You just have to wait a few months. Will you come over for dinner? Hello. Genny, I must get back. I need a come back. I won't talk to you, Tony. It's not the time to play the offended one. I'm tired of it, Tony. I'm not your manager any more. I need that job. Fuck you, Tony! I won't say it again Bongusto will be on that ship. Do you know why, Tony? Cause you can't clear customs with a pound of coke on you! We need to talk. Pisapia, what are you doing here? - We must talk. - Let's talk then. How did you know I was here? You told me many years ago that you come to the office every Sunday after the match. Let's make it quick. I must attend a wedding. The assistant coach should be chosen by Molosso. Should. But I take the decisions here. - And you chose Palumbo, that moron. - Bull shit. Palumbo is smart. And the next season? Molosso wants me. What do you say? Next season we'll see whether Molosso will still be around... whether I'll still be around. Heaven knows what will happen. What do you mean? "Whether he's still around"? Molosso has a contract. Contracts are signed and unsigned. Molosso is fine for now. I had to keep him: the fans were crushing my balls, hurling at my doorstep every second night. But why can't I be the assistant coach? I told you. Palumbo is smart, he's a promise. I got it. Next year you'll drop Molosso and promote Palumbo, right? Listen. For me, you don't have what it takes to be coach. Why do you insist? Nobody has called you in, not even a minor team. I'm telling you, try another job. Why this obsession about being a coach? If you're concerned about the vouchers, I'll issue whatever you need. What are you saying? What do they have to do with it? In any case, I'd be willing to coach even the junior team. It doesn't have to be necessarily the main team. It would be presumptuous from me to ask you that. Antonio, I must tell you what I think. Soccer is but a game and you are a man of sorrows. Give me this octopus. Octopus, Tony? You never bought one before. And now I do. Hello? I'm calling on behalf of the producers of the TV program "Public Confessions". Have you had the chance to watch it? - No. - It doesn't matter. The program is hosted by Gigi Moscati, who interviews famous guests about their personal lives. - We'd love to have you on the program. - Call me again tomorrow. We can offer our guests a 3 million reimbursement for their time. Moreover, it is broadcast from Naples, which would make it easier for you. If possible, we'd love to hear a potpourri of your old hits. I never sing potpourris! Call me again tomorrow. Ok. If you have any doubts about our program, you can watch a live broadcast tonight at 10:30. Call me again tomorrow. Ok, bye. The bashful tend to assume a defensive position. They tend to hide behind the strikers, avoiding to draw any attention. It worked well as long as the man marking was in use. But since the zone marking was introduced, there was no place left for the bashful. They were thrown into the spotlight. I never knew how to do it. But you did quite well in the spotlight... scoring a spectacular bicycle kick goal. A half bicycle kick. - What goes through your mind in front of the goal? - I've always sought to avoid the goal. Right, at that moment, when I was about to kick the ball... I saw the fans. 80.000 people and all eyes on me. Some days later, however, during the training... your ligaments were torn and your life is turned upside down. What happened? I haven't been able to get back on the field after the accident. - I decided to become a coach. - Are you coaching now? - No. - How come? The President of my former team had assured me... I'd have a chance to go on working with them. Later, he went back on his word. He said I don't have what it takes to be coach. How can anyone say that, if no one ever gave me a chance to show it? Anyway, I don't want to talk about it. I want to say something else. Today... I've met someone... Please, go on. You were saying you've met someone today. Now we'll show you a short film about Antonio Pisapia. We'll be right back. Where do we go? Take me to the airport. Are you leaving? Yes. I must go to Holland to evaluate a player. Yes? Here's Tony Pisapia. I'm supposed to be on your show next week. Can you do me a favor? I need the number of Antonio Pisapia? We can't tell the private telephone numbers of our guests. You must give me immediately the number of Antonio Pisapia. Is it clear? the telephone number of Antonio Pisapia. Is that clear? Is it 7:00? # GR 1.# # Breaking news.# # Naples: The former soccer player, Antonio Pisapia,# # has killed himself with a bullet to the head.# # The body has been found on the soccer field # # across from the Capodichino airport.# And the shaving? Everything ready. Smoking is forbidden here. Damn! Now be still. It might hurt a little. But don't move. Does it hurt? Hello? Here is the producer of "Public Confessions". Yes, I'll do it. But we need to talk about the money. - 3 million? - For what do you take me? It's our standard contract. Why, do I seem to be the standard type? I've watched the program. It's all about the past. Do you have any idea of what I can tell about my past? We could offer 4 million. You can offer 6. Call me this evening. Listen, boys. We'll try something new today... One man up. Ok. Bye. President, Antonio Pisapia is here. Good evening. We'll finish it. Wait a moment. Welcome, Tony. I am Gigi. How are you? Fine, thanks. - Saverio, my man! - Hi, Tony, what's up? As you can see, kicking ass. Tony, what's this shit with your hair? Some bastard told me to use this fucking shampoo... - Let's take our places? - Sure! That's your seat. Tony, in a few moments we'll be on live. I have prepared some questions. Do you know that I used to sing here when you hadn't even been born? Singing has always been my dream. When I was a child, I remember my father used to get real mad... but I just sang more and more. He slapped me and I sang even more. I remember the stand mics. I remember Mina, Walter Chiari and Alberto Lupo. Alberto used to burst in laughs with me. I remember every stage where I stood, every song I sang, every dressing room... every flash from every photographer, every dedication on every album... the autographs, the tours, the restaurants, the laughs... every tear shed by every fan. I was born in Vico Speranzella. I remember Naples during the war. I was 8. I remember the bomb shelter under Augustea Square. And more... I remember I used to have... 6 smokings, 150 shirts, 90 pairs of shoes. I remember the first time I wore handcuffs... every tear I shed. How I cried every time they moved me from one prison to the other. When the wardens submitted me to the anal inspection. I remember every cellmate. I remember every time I had to lower my voice and every time I've been afraid to get on stage. I remember the flowers in the dressing rooms... the women outside the dressing rooms, eager to get closer to me. They used to find me interesting and it always ended in bed. They used to tell me I was handsome, but I never felt like being handsome. I felt like being mighty. I never gave a damn. I remember everything. It's bull shit what they say about the coke fucking your memory. I've been sniffing for 30 years and I remember everything. I remember all the coke I've sniffed. But everybody did it in those fucked up times. Who can say he didn't? Only the poor haven't done it. And they don't know what they've missed. I remember when I've sung in New York... and Frank Sinatra had to come by and listen to the phenomenal Tony. I remember my mother, when she was young. What can I say? She's still the most ravishing woman of my life. I remember a good friend, his name was Antonio Pisapia. He was a terrific soccer player. He wanted to become coach and they never let him do it. And thus he killed himself. But they'll never suicide me... cause I remember one more thing: I've always loved freedom. You don't have a fucking clue of what it means. I've always loved freedom. I'm a free man. - Hi, Carmine! - Hi, Tony! What's new? Life is shit, Aniello. Take care, Tony! I'll row till Capri! Tell me how it tastes. This film is dedicated to Tina and Sasá Subtitles by kinofil and bastelik Subtitles - Ripped (and Hacked) by ravydavy - Part of the [RL] Crew A little past 10:00pm, I was dressed to the nines at Brasserie 8-1/2. Located on the corner of "Right Now" and "Everyone Was There"... it was the place to see and be seen. Look at that one. Mary, hail a cab. - Do you think he's a model? - A model what? A model citizen, a model home... - a model airplane? - I think he's the dirty-haired Gucci guy... - with clean hair. - He's so versatile. - Why don't you go over and say hello? - He's gorgeous. The only way to get a guy like him interested in me would be to pay. My love, there's no need for you to enter Hookerville. Carrie, I know what I look like. Then you can't see what I see. Carrie! Lynne Cameron was a much sought after fashion-show producer... as valuable to a show's success as Valium or Velcro. I just told Damian you have just so fucking saved my life. - I did? - Sorry, this is my boyfriend, Damian. I use the term "boyfriend" loosely, as Damian is clearly a homosexual. In that case, this is my boyfriend, Stanford. You so have to be in this fashion show I'm doing. A mix of models and New York people with style. And no one is more New York or has more style than you. Lynne, I'm a writer. You're fucking doing my show if I have to hunt you down... skin you alive, and have one of the other models fucking wear you. I'll call you next week. Could this place be any louder? Bye. I am so coming. To what? I'm not a model. Then you can't see what I see. I'll start with a salad with extra blue cheese dressing. Thank you. Are the vegetables on the veggie plate organic? They have beef pot pie on the menu, what do you think? I'll just have a cup of hot water with lemon. Thank you. Isn't it hard to eat just organic all the time? It is so hard. Last night I could not stop thinking about a Big Mac. I finally had to get dressed, go out and pick up a guy. Talk about a happy meal. Lady, you have never looked better. Your body is amazing. I hope so. I'm having nude photographs taken on Wednesday. What're you gonna do? Have postcards made up... to hand out to prospective dates? This is not about a man's approval. This photo is just for me. So when I'm old and my tits are in my shoes... I can look at it and say, "Damn, I was hot." - Isn't that a little narcissistic? - No one thinks that... when you get your seventh-grade picture taken. - You weren't naked in that. - That we know of. Look, I like my body. I'm getting these pictures taken, what's the big problem? No problem, you're my hero. I think it's fantastic that you can just put it out there. I can't even say yes to being in some charity fashion show. - "New York Style"? - Yeah. You were asked to be part of that? That's huge. - All the top designers are doing it. - They want you to be a model? No, it's a mix of real people... and models. I know the producer. You have to do it, you live for fashion. I do not live for fashion. How many fashion shows did you drag me to during Fashion Week? - Eight, what's your point? - Why are you turning down... - the chance to actually be in one? - I do not belong on a runway. Runways are for models, not writers. What's the difference between strutting down a runway... and the way you strut down Fifth Avenue? Strut? - Do I strut? Am I a strutter? - I think it'd be fun. I was a teen model when the Ralph Lauren store opened in New Haven. Okay, it's amazing I was able to keep my lunch down just now. I just... I cannot imagine walking down a runway while people sit there and judge me. - No one would judge you. - We judge models all the time. But you're not a model, you're one of the real people. Exactly. I don't want people to think that I can't see the difference between a model and me. Who gives a fuck what people think? This is a fabulous opportunity. Honey. - You'll probably get to keep the clothes. - I thought of that! - I'd do it in a New York minute. - So would I. What do you think, mutey? While Miranda would never dream of walking on a runway... she had no problem running on one. I happen to know you were on that treadmill for longer than 30 minutes. That's illegal here at Crunch Fitness. I'm starting to train for the marathon. - First time. - Wow! Good for you. I was the captain of my high-school track team, but the marathon... I'm Dave. Miranda. Have a good workout. That's it? - Is there more? - I hope so. I've been watching you for months. I think that you are very sexy. So, what's the problem? He said, "I think you're very sexy." And? I was wearing no makeup and my Hanes $3 old man's undershirt. Nice. I can't believe a guy would think that I was sexy. - Okay, I'm hanging up now. - I'm serious. Smart, yes. Sometimes cute, but never sexy. Sexy is the thing... I try to get them to see me as, after I win them over with my personality. You win men over with your personality? They want you to be a model? Okay, I'm hanging up now. Later that night, I got to thinking about Narcissus. A man so consumed with his own image, he drowned in it. Did he have no best friends to mirror back a healthier view of himself? And why is it that we can see our friends perfectly... but when it comes to ourselves, no matter how hard we look... do we ever see ourselves clearly? Samantha, on the other hand, saw herself a little too clearly. Okay, Samantha... Tiger, here, has a variety of music choices to ease you into the shoot... and help you to feel more comfortable. Tiger? - I've got some Steely Dan... - I'm comfortable. Okay. Camera, Tiger. Yes, sir. - Do you like your gynecologist? - She's amazing, why? I think I might wanna see someone else. - What's happening? - Trey and I are still just talking. - We're not ready to move back in yet. - What's happening with your vagina? Sweetie, I'm not bugged, it's just us listening. Maybe a yeast infection. But my gynecologist says no. - But something's definitely off. - What are the symptoms? I don't wanna talk about this. Can you call my machine and leave her number? Do you know anyone that Stanford could go out with? If we don't find someone, he's gonna start dating hookers. Hookers? Exactly. Charlotte... would you say that I'm strutting right now? Charlotte decided for Stanford Blatch, it would have to be someone cute. Someone with style, someone like... Anthony Marantino, her wedding-gown stylist. - What? - Anthony, hi. It's Charlotte York MacDougal. Sorry, thought it was my mother. 15 phone calls to make sure... I get her the cheapest sheets I can, from Bed, Bath and friggin' Beyond. I was wondering if you were dating anyone now. I'm dating everyone now, why? I have this friend, Stanford... What's he look like? He is adorable. In a movie, who would play him? I don't know... A younger Ed Harris. That's hot. And speaking of hot, Miranda ended her first date with Captain Crunch. - That was fun. - I hope I didn't talk too much. I think the only words you actually said all night were, "That was fun." God, you are so sexy. What? You don't think so? Maybe he was right. After all, who was Miranda to argue with the Captain? - Hello? - Miss Motherfucker... why have you not returned my last 200 phone calls? Lynne. I really don't think that I should do this show. I mean, come on, I am not a model. And as much as I would like to think... Carrie, you're in or you're out, I don't have time for this. I'm sure Dolce Gabbana can find someone else to dress. Dolce Gabbana? Each designer picks the person they want to dress. Dolce Gabbana picked me? Yes, fuckette. And those are some picky Italians. Do you think that I would be able to keep the outfit? What's up, love? I'm coming. Me likie. Perfect in the bust and the waist. Turn, love. Do we likie? No likie the length. We must take it up about four feet. I know, I'm too short. But I'm very comfortable in heels. Honestly, the higher the better. So feel free to put me up in the big gal shoes. Walk, love. If we gave it to Heidi, we wouldn't have to take it up. Heidi Klum? Yes, turn, love. Yes, trot back. Trot? Good. Look what the pussies dragged in. Hello, Oscar. We're just calling me "O" now, love. Who's this? Carrie Bradshaw, our New York Style model. Model, God, no. - I'm a writer. - I'm Paul Denai. - I'm a photographer. I'm... - Sure, I love... - I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry. I just... I know your photographs. I'm doing a little behind-the-scenes book about Fashion Week. Do you mind if I shoot your fitting? Sorry, I wasn't ready. So go ahead. That's the point, don't mind me. I like the element of surprise. I could give you a surprise, love. Now, what's your opinion, love? - Me love or him love? - You, love. I don't know, whatever you think. No, changed my mind, got something better. That was bad. I'm sorry, I'm very uncomfortable having my photograph taken. How does a girl who doesn't like having her picture taken wind up in a fashion show? I'm in it for the free goods. Maybe... if I explained how a camera works over a glass of wine sometime... I've... - never been a gal to turn down a free lesson. - Or a free dress. Here it is. Do we likie? We likie! And speaking of uncomfortable... Okay... you can put your legs down now. It is not a yeast infection. - It's not? - I have an entire file of women... all with the same symptoms. Itching, stinging, burning. All of them think they have a yeast infection. It's not. It could be vulvodynia. - Is it serious? - No. It's mostly just uncomfortable. We can get it under control. I'm gonna prescribe a light antidepressant. - But I'm not depressed. - It's not for you. It's for your vagina. Your vagina's depressed? The mood elevator sort of corrects the imbalance. Wait, how do you know your vagina's depressed? - There are symptoms. - It can't meet its deadline? It always wants to go to Krispy Kreme? It's so funny, my vagina's depressed. Stop. - I might have vulvodynia. - Vulva-what-ya? So, everyday... I have to keep a vagina journal. Come on. A "Dear vagina, why so blue?" Kind of journal? "Dear vagina... "guess who I have a crush on?" More like: "Itchy today? Not itchy." - Sounds like a bestseller. - Ready to order? I guess we're still waiting. But could I have a hot water and lemon? Thanks. I'm fine, but, Charlotte, maybe your hmm-hmm would like an order of fries. I guess not, thank you. Sorry I'm late. I had to pick up my nude contact sheets. Look. Okay, but only until the food arrives. Charlotte, I want your professional art-eye opinion. That's not very arty. I can see your... Everything. This is the full frontal. I just did that to warm up. You should have warned me, really. What's the big deal? It's just a vagina. It's magnified. I've never even seen mine that close. You've never seen yourself up close and personal? - Have you seen yours that close? - How'd I get involved? You've never looked at yourself with a hand mirror? Oh, my God! Honey, I insist you go home right now and take a look. Or better yet, take my compact and make a quick trip to the ladies' room. I don't want to look. I think it's ugly. Maybe that's why it's depressed. What did I miss? On their second date... Miranda did most of the talking. She was feeling confident and sexy. I like my life. I love my job, I love my friends. She couldn't believe how comfortable this new Miranda felt. And I love meeting new people... like you. Miranda had no idea what had changed. I want pure class. I'm thinking ash... or a charcoal-gray matte inside the frame. Inch on either side? Even though Samantha had done the photo just for her... she still wanted to be seen a certain way by men. Charcoal would bring out the gray tones. The matte should stop about an inch away from my breast... right here, see my breast? And then stop right around here, near my ass. See that? Right near my ass. How's next Thursday? Whatever. And you took this one of Cindy Crawford. See, "Photo by Paul Denai." How can you still remember? It was the '90s. It was '92. I loved her beauty mark so much. I used to pencil one on, you know, and then... I'd move it around whenever I had a blemish. So, you know, it'd be here, then here... and sometimes here and here. Here's another one. - Man. - I can't believe you have this book. - It's getting embarrassing. - Are you crazy? I love this. When I first moved to New York, and I was broke... sometimes I would buy Vogue instead of dinner. I just felt it fed me more. I used to do all that high-fashion shit... but the behind-the-scenes stuff I'm doing now is so much better. It's more real. Real. Ick. The reality of people and all their little flaws... it's the little flaws that make them so much more beautiful. Forget reality and tell me about the models. Who's a big bitch and who's a bigger bitch? Sorry... I never click and tell. Why are you so fascinated with the models? I just love 'em. They're just beautiful. I wanna show you something. You show me... one model... who's more alive... or more beautiful than her. - So, which one is your new boyfriend? - It was only one kiss. It's so predictable. A model dating a photographer. Stanny, I'm a model. Excuse me. I may have a stroke. Do I look all right? I'm nervous about the Charlotte fix-up. You look fabulous, have fabulous seats. Everything's gonna be fabulous. - I can't think about you now. I'm a model. - You're a supermodel. I made them put me in these super high heels. I'm gonna be so freaking tall. Supermodel and super size it, please. Excuse me, hi, I'm Carrie Bradshaw. Where do I go? Over with the non-models. What's her problem? - Gucci and Dolce and Dior. - Oh, my. Look, this is the Polaroid of the dress. Me likie. That's a fashion thing. Here's one of Frank Rich. And Fran Lebowitz. These are the other real people? Okay, what the fuck's wrong? Frank Rich, Lynne? Fran Lebowitz? What, Dolce Gabbana couldn't get Ed Koch? Gucci got him, what's the problem? I'm such an idiot. - Actually convinced myself I belonged here. - You do belong here. Can I go home? No, the entire show is timed per model. I'm a non-model. But you're fabulous. Lighten up. Okay, so you're not Heidi Klum. But you're the modeliest of the real people. I mean, he told me I was sexy. And then he didn't want to kiss me. Was it me? Suddenly I wasn't sexy? What does it mean? Who knows? He's a man. You can lay your pussy on a table in front of one... and still not know what he's thinking. And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse... There's been a change, you're not wearing this. You're wearing this. Okay. I'm gonna need to speak to someone. I had to lose the dress, love. I saw that Dior is showing something similar right before you. It's a fashion house of cards. I can't wear jeweled underwear. I just want you to look at them. Aren't they fantastic? How can I make this clear? Me no likie. Paul, can you do something? Okay, but not that. Oh, my God! - Try them on, you'll love them. - No, please, really, I'm gonna faint. I can't wear jeweled panties and strut out in front of Frank Rich. I respect Frank Rich. Frank Rich is a writer. You're not just wearing panties, love. They come with a fantastic coat. Trot round there and try them on. I have a certain look, you know? And I just really don't think... that jeweled panties is it. If you look like a whale, we won't send you out there. We're Dolce Gabbana, for Chrissakes. Now come out or I'm coming in. God! Fantastic. Now the hair's all wrong. We need big hair. Char, this is so exciting. Stanford Blatch, this is Anthony Marantino. Hi. Marantino, is that Italian? Sicilian. Is that different? Yeah. I'd better go check on Carrie. Ed Harris? Try "Ed, I have no hair-is." I thought you two would hit it off. Why, because he's gay and I'm gay? Let me clear something up for you. I'm a nice little package. I got good arms and a high, tight ass. I could do a lot better. Ten minutes and ten hair extensions later... I can't believe Charlotte would set me up with such a queen. Is that who she thinks I am? Someone who'd date such queen? I don't have time to decipher the levels of queendom in your world right now. Would you please go get me another champagne? That is big hair. - Thank you. - Orlando, she looks fabulous. We need the big eyes to go with the big hair. - Kevyn Aucoin, Carrie Bradshaw. - Nice to meet you, ready for makeup? Okay, sure. Hi, I know you're a genius, but here's the thing. - I'm a writer. - I know, I'm a big fan of your column. Don't worry, you're gonna look fabulous. - Okay. - Okay? - Here. - Nobody's listening to me. - They keep telling me I'm fabulous. - You are fabulous. Bring Samantha here. She'll tell me the truth. - I can't go back. That queen's out there. - Go. Crisis. Carrie needs to see you backstage. Where's her highness? - What? - Your little friend, where is he? He had to go. Why? He didn't like me? He had... a decorating emergency. I've been rejected by someone I wasn't interested in. I hate when that happens. Lynne, we're okay to go. Lights, go. Music cue four, go. Gucci. Samantha? Tell me the truth. I know people don't mean it when they say that, but I do. Honey... you're a model. - You'd tell me, right? - Absolutely. You're a model. Look how tall I am. The shoes were my idea. - Christian Dior. - I gotta get out there. - Go, model. - All right. You're Heidi Klum. - Wow! Those are fantastic. - Really? Do I look okay? - You look fabulous. - Thanks. Okay, let's go. Okay. Bye. Bye-bye. - Wait till you see our gal. - Really? When is she coming out? She's next. - Dolce Gabbana. - Carrie, go. Didn't I tell you? Fuck me hard! Heidi, go. Oh, my God, she's fashion roadkill. Stop fucking taking my picture. I had a choice, I could slink off the runway and let my inner model die of shame... or I could pick myself up, flaws and all, and finish. And that's just what I did. Because when real people fall down in life... they get right back up and keep on walking. Katia, go. Turns out, my little act of bravery... inspired three other people to acts of bravery as well. Miranda faced her fear of knowing the truth. - Hi. - Hi. I'm really confused. I thought we had a good time and then you never called. And I never called because you never called. I guess that's fine, but... I just have to know. Did I do something? No. Yeah... I don't know. We were sitting on the couch, and you just... You seem a little full of yourself. Okay, glad we straightened that out. Cheeseburger and fries. Samantha faced her fear of what real food would do to her perfect figure. Thanks. Nice ass. I didn't tip you enough. And Charlotte faced her fear of seeing herself. And just like Narcissus before her... Charlotte became so mesmerized by what she saw, that... And as for me... I tucked my jeweled underwear and my inner model away... where they belonged... and went back to my life as a real person. Subtitles conformed by SOFTITLER Ripped by ravydavy part of the [RL] Crew I CALLED YOUR ADOPTION AGENCY BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT, WHILE I'M PROFESSIONALLY SUCCESSFUL, PERSONALLY, SOMETHING'S MISSING. I HAVE A LOT OF LOVE TO GIVE, AND I KNOW THAT I WOULD MAKE A GOOD AND DECENT FATHER. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. BUT ALL I ASKED WAS YOUR DATE OF BIRTH. SORRY. I'M... A LITTLE NERVOUS. [ LAUGHS ] I DON'T THINK HE'S DOING WELL. WE'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING. NEXT QUESTION -- IS YOUR -- OH, SORRY TO INTERRUPT. CARTER, THANKS FOR WRITING THE SPEECH. YOU'RE A VERY THOUGHTFUL, INTELLIGENT, RESPONSIB PERSON. THANK YOU, CAITLIN. [ DOOR CLOSES ] SORRY ABOUT THAT. UH, PLEASE CONTINUE. CARTER... GREAT JOB ON THAT BUDGET REPORT. IT WAS VERY... LOVING AND FATHERING. UH, AGAIN, I'M SORRY. THEY'RE MY FRIENDS. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO HELP. OH, THERE YOU ARE, CARTER. I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME TO THAT BASEBALL GAME, BUYING ME A HOT DOG, AND GIVING ME THAT TALK ABOUT THE BIRDS AND THE BEES. CARTER, YOU'RE THE GREATEST. [ DOOR CLOSES ] THAT STORY WAS A BIT MUCH. ACTUALLY, THAT ONE REALLY HAPPENED. SIR, THE LATEST ELECTION POLLS ARE IN. OH, EXCELLENT. I'M BEATING WHEELER BY 19% AMONG YOUNG ADULTS, 14% AMONG WOMEN -- HEH HEH. I'M DOWN 6% WITH SENIORS. WHAT DO THOSE GEEZERS HAVE AGAINST ME? IT'S A MYSTERY, SIR. OH, GUYS, GUYS -- WHEELER'S NEW CAMPAIGN AD. I'M JULIAN WHEELER, AND I BELIEVE IN PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. WHAT ABOUT WINSTON? I BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY IS THE FUTURE. WHAT ABOUT WINSTON? [ BEEPING ] AND I BELIEVE IN OLD-FASHIONED FAMILY VALUES. WHAT ABOUT WINSTON? FOR A BETTER NEW YORK, VOTE WHEELER. BRAVO, SIR. YOU LOOKED GREAT. SIR... MY GUT SAYS WE RETALIATE. HE ATTACKS US, WE ATTACK HIM. LET'S HIT HIM BACK WITH EVERYTHING WE GOT. THANK YOU, SONNY CORLEONE. SIR, FOCUS-GROUP RESEARCH INDICATES THAT VOTERS PREFER POLITICIANS WHO STAY POSITIVE AND STICK TO THE ISSUES. THANK YOU, BRENDA MILLER. WHO'S BRENDA MILLER? SOME BRAINY GIRL I USED TO CHEAT OFF IN HIGH SCHOOL. YOU KNOW, SIR... WE COULD ALWAYS HIT THEM WITH SOME SNAPS. SNAPS? WITTY REMARKS, LIKE "WHEELER'S MAMA IS SO FAT... WHEN SHE HAULS ASS, SHE HAS TO MAKE TWO TRIPS." WELL, I'VE HEARD SOME COMPELLING ARGUMENTS. I PREFER TO RUN MY CAMPAIGN ON ISSUES, NOT ON INSULTS. SO I'M GONNA GO WITH CAITLIN ON THIS ONE. THANK YOU, SIR. IN FACT, I'VE DECIDED TO CHOOSE ONE OF YOU TO BE THE POINT PERSON FOR ALL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIES. WELL, THANK YOU, SIR. I'M HONORED. SINCE CAITLIN HAS THE MOST CAMPAIGN EXPERIENCE, I'M CHOOSING HER. GOOD CALL, SIR. WELL, THE ADOPTION AGENCY SAYS I'M STILL NUMBER 3,000 ON THE WAITING LIST. AT THIS RATE, I'LL HAVE A BABY WHEN I'M 87. I'LL BE TOO OLD TO TEACH HIM HOW TO THROW A BASEBALL. ON THE UPSIDE, YOU HAVE 50 YEARS TO LEARN YOURSELF. GUESS WHO. CHANEL No. 5... LAVENDER HAND CREAM... BRIAN? CARTER! YOU KNOW IT'S ME. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE! MICHELLE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN TOWN? CARTER TOLD ME EVERYTHING HE WAS GOING THROUGH TRYING TO ADOPT. I KNEW HE WAS UPSET, SO HERE I AM. WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR EACH OTHER. EVEN IN HIGH SCHOOL, CARTER WAS THERE TO CHEER ME UP WHEN I GOT DUMPED BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM. AND MICHELLE GAVE ME A SHOULDER TO CRY ON WHEN HE DUMPED ME. HELLO, MICHELLE. IT'S SO VERY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. AS ALWAYS, YOU LOOK LOVELY. THANK YOU, STUART. YOU ARE SO SWEET. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO GET SOME LUNCH? GREAT IDEA. SEE YOU GUYS LATER. GOODBYE, MICHELLE. IT WAS LOVELY SEEING YOU. HAVE A LOVELY AFTERNOON. SO, HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD A CRUSH ON MICHELLE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I JUST THINK IT WAS LOVELY THE WAY YOU SAID SHE WAS LOVELY. STOP IT. LOVELY, LOVELY, LOVELY, LOVELY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, MR. JERRY FLYNN, THE KING OF PORN, IS DOING A VIDEO SIGNING. YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE THE KING OF PORN? WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME? YOU LIKE MICHELLE. WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER? I CAN'T. I GET NEAR HER, I CAN BARELY TALK. MAYBE CARTER COULD TALK TO HER FOR YOU. OH, CARTER CAN'T KNOW. HE'LL EITHER DISAPPROVE, OR WORSE -- GET EMOTIONALLY SUPPORTIVE. OKAY, I'VE JUST CALLED WHEELER'S HEADQUARTERS, AND I'VE SET UP A SIT-DOWN MEETING WITH HIM. WE'LL GET HIM IN A ROOM, LIQUOR HIM UP, MAKE HIM SPILL SOME SECRETS, AND RUIN HIS CAMPAIGN. NO, WE'RE GONNA SIT DOWN, AIR OUT OUR DIFFERENCES, AND ESTABLISH GROUND RULES. THEN WE'LL LIQUOR HIM UP AND RUIN HIS CAMPAIGN. NO. WE SHOULD BE BEATING THIS GUY INTO THE DIRT. YOU NEED TO PULL BACK ON THE TESTOSTERONE. YOU NEED TO PULL BACK ON THE -- WHAT IS THAT STUFF CHICKS HAVE? THERE'S A REASON THE MAYOR MADE ME THE POINT PERSON. I'VE RUN SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGNS, AND THIS IS HOW I DO IT. WHATEVER. OH, I SEE WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. YOU'RE UPSET THAT THE MAYOR CHOSE ME OVER YOU. HE MADE THE CALL. I'M FINE WITH IT. THERE'S A LOT MORE GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD THAN YOU LET ON. LIKE RIGHT NOW, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? RIGHT NOW. THOSE DANCING HOT DOGS FROM THE "LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY" END MOVIE SONG. WHY DO I BOTHER? * Let's all go to the lobby... HI, STUART. OH, HEY, MICHELLE. WHERE'S CARTER? HE WENT OUT FOR A WHILE. I'M HAVING A BEER. I'LL GET YOU ONE. THAT WOULD BE... GLORIOUS. "GLORIOUS"? ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN. YOU CAN DO THIS. DON'T FREAK OUT. YOU'RE THE MAN. YOU'RE FREAKING OUT. YOU'RE NOT THE MAN. HERE YOU GO. STUART? ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING? I'VE REALLY LIKED YOU FOR A LONG TIME, AND I WOULD LOVE TO GO OUT WITH YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I ALWAYS IMAGINED YOU SAYING, "ARE YOU KIDDING? I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU." OH, AND THEN YOU LAUGH. I WOULD LOVE TO GO OUT WITH YOU. WHY? I MEAN, COOL. NO, "WHY" WAS RIGHT. REMEMBER TWO CHRISTMASES AGO WHEN CARTER DRAGGED US TO ROCKEFELLER CENTER TO WATCH THAT FIGURE-SKATING SHOW? YEAH, IT WAS FREEZING. AND YOU GAVE ME YOUR MITTENS. THAT'S WHEN I KNEW I LIKED YOU. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? YOU'RE ALWAYS SO PROPER AROUND ME. "YOU LOOK SO LOVELY." "IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU." I MEAN, WHEN I A GUY LIKES A GIRL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY, "BABY, I WANNA GET WITH YOU." THAT WAS WHAT WAS IN MY HEART. WHEELER'S 20 MINUTES LATE. HE'LL BE HERE, SIR. THEN WE'LL WORK OUT A SOLUTION TO THESE PERSONAL ATTACKS. IF THIS DOESN'T WORK, WE COULD ALWAYS BAKE HIM SOME COOKIES. I NEED A DRINK. EXCUSE ME. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE SUPPORTIVE. I'M HERE, AREN'T I? IF YOU EXPECT ME TO BE YOUR CHEERLEADER -- WHO'S THAT GUY SITTING WITH THE MAYOR? I DON'T KNOW. WAIT. THAT'S JERRY FLYNN. HE'S, LIKE, THE CITY'S KING OF PORN. WE'RE BEING SET UP. THANKS, MR. MAYOR. OH, BY THE WAY... MR. WHEELER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT. HE'S GONE WAY TOO FAR THIS TIME. I'LL SAY -- WHEELER SHOULD'VE CALLED IF HE KNEW HE WAS GONNA CANCEL. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU LIKED ME? WE COULD'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME AGO. WE HAVE BEEN... IN MY MIND. YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN MY MIND? OH! MICHELLE... GOOD. YOU'RE HERE. THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. ACTUALLY, THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. ME FIRST. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I WANT TO HAVE A CHILD. AND ADOPTION WILL TAKE FOREVER. SO I DECIDED THAT THE BEST THING TO DO BE WOULD BE GET A SURROGATE. CARTER, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO, BECAUSE I WAS HOPING MAYBE YOU'D CONSIDER DOING IT. WOW! I'M TOUCHED THAT YOU WOULD ASK. BUT, WELL, I-IT'S COMPLICATED. I UNDERSTAND - - YOU LIVE IN A DIFFERENT CITY, IT'S A HUGE COMMITMENT, IT COULD AFFECT OUR FRIENDSHIP, STUART'S ARM IS AROUND YOUR WAIST. WHY IS STUART'S ARM AROUND YOUR WAIST? MICHELLE AND I ARE -- WHAT ARE WE? WELL, I-I GUESS WE'RE DATING. YOU'RE DATING STUART? WHY? I ASKED HER THE SAME QUESTION. CARTER, I'M GONNA SERIOUSLY CONSIDER WHAT YOU'VE ASKED ME, BUT, UM... I FEEL LIKE STUART AND I HAVE STARTED SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY BE SPECIAL, SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S COMFORTABLE WITH IT. WELL? AM I COMFORTABLE WITH CARTER IMPREGNATING MY NEW GIRLFRIEND? NO. HAVE YOU SEEN THE HEADLINES -- "MAYOR DINES WITH SMUT KING"? "WINSTON'S BREAST BUDDY"? "WINSTON - - A PORN LEADER." WHAT PAPER WAS THAT IN? NONE. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY. WELL, IT'S NOT. WE HAVE TRIED TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD, BUT WHEELER HAS GONE TOO FAR. IF YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO GO AFTER THIS GUY, WE'RE READY. I HAVE NEVER LOST AN ELECTION, AND I'M SURE AS HELL NOT GONNA LOSE ONE NOW. I'LL ADMIT, I WAS WRONG ABOUT WHEELER. HE'S A LOWLIFE. SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW? STUART'S CHECKING HIS TAX HISTORY WITH THE I.R.S., AND CARTER'S LOOKING FOR ANY CRIMINAL RECORD. MAYBE ONE NIGHT, HE GOT INTO A DRUNKEN BAR FIGHT, STOLE A CAR, AND DROVE INTO THE HUDSON RIVER. THAT'S MY STORY. IT SOUNDED FAMILIAR AS I WAS SAYING IT. HEY, GUYS, A BUDDY OF MINE SAYS WHEELER'S BEEN SHOWING UP AT HIS APARTMENT BUILDING WITH SOME LITTLE CHIPPY. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE HAS A WOMAN ON THE SIDE. THAT'S WHAT A CHIPPY IS? WOW! THAT'S EVEN BETTER! THIS IS HUGE. HE'S GOT A WIFE AND FOUR KIDS. I'M NOT SURE THIS SEX SCANDAL IS THE WAY TO GO. THIS GUY'S WHOLE PLATFORM IS ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. I KNOW, BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF. THEN WE'LL GET SOME. WE'LL STAKE OUT HIS BUILDING AND TAKE SOME PICTURES. MAYBE WE'LL CATCH HIM DRUNK IN A ROOFTOP POOL, PLAYING NAKED MARCO POLO WITH A LONELY DIVORCéE FROM 3-G. I GOTTA STOP TELLING YOU MY STORIES. REAL NICE, CARTER. YOU SHOW NO CLASS. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE MICHELLE IS LISTENING TO THE OPINION OF MAN WHOSE INTERNET NAME IS "BOOB MONGER." WELL, SHE IS, AND FOR THE LAST TIME, IT'S "BOOB MEISTER." WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GROW UP? WHEN ARE YOU GONNA STOP BEING A POMPOUS JERK? GUYS, COME ON, YOU'VE BEEN AT IT ALL DAY. NOW, THE THREE OF US, WE'RE GONNA SIT DOWN, AND NOBODY'S LEAVING UNTIL WE FIX THIS. OKAY. WHAT'S GOING ON? I JUST STARTED TO DATE CARTER'S BEST FRIEND, AND NOW HE WANTS HER TO CARRY HIS GAY BABY. YOU GUYS WILL WORK IT OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT? I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I WANT TO HAVE A CHILD, AND MICHELLE IS THE ONLY PERSON I'D WANT TO BE MY SURROGATE. YOU CAN STILL ADOPT. THE WAITING LIST FOR A NEW BABY IS TWO YEARS! BY THAT TIME, ROSIE O'DONNELL WILL HAVE TAKEN THE GOOD ONES! HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT MICHELLE MIGHT MEAN TO ME? SHE COULD BE THE GREATEST THING THAT'S HAPPENED IN MY LIFE. BUT INSTEAD OF BEING HAPPY FOR ME, ALL YOU THINK ABOUT IS HOW IT AFFECTS YOU. YEAH? WELL -- AT LEAST I DON'T EAT FOOD OUT OF THE GARBAGE. IT WAS ONE UNPEELED TANGERINE! WOULD YOU LET IT GO? ! SO I GUESS YOU'RE NOT ON BOARD FOR CARTER'S BABY PLAN, HUH? FOR ONCE, HE'S BEING PETTY AND SELFISH. I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS, AND I KNOW I'M RIGHT. WELL, I'M SURE YOU ARE. ALTHOUGH YOU MAY WANT TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT IF YOU AND MICHELLE DON'T WORK OUT? IS THAT WORTH RISKING YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH CARTER? ON THE OTHER HAND, IT MAY WORK OUT. WHAT IF YOU AND MICHELLE ARE TOGETHER FOREVER? ISN'T NINE MONTHS A SMALL SACRIFICE IF YOU CAN GIVE YOUR BEST FRIEND IMMEASURABLE HAPPINESS? WELL, I'M SURE YOU'VE THOUGHT OF ALL THE ANGLES. ALL THESE YEARS, AND YOU CHOOSE THIS MOMENT TO START MAKING SENSE. I PICK MY SPOTS, BOOB MEISTER. YOU EVER BEEN ON A STAKEOUT BEFORE? NOT ON THIS END. THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME. IF WE GET OUT OF HERE NOW, I COULD STILL MAKE MY DATE. YOU HAVE A DATE TONIGHT? WE GOT THE VAN. WAIT. CHIPPY -- 3:00. HE'S GOT HIS ARM AROUND HER, AND THEY'RE KISSING. AH! YOU ARE SO BUSTED. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS WRONG. IF WE GO PUBLIC WITH THIS, WE'LL BE COMING DOWN TO HIS LEVEL. I SAY, "RUN A POSITIVE CAMPAIGN," YOU'RE AGAINST IT. NOW I'M READY TO GO NEGATIVE, AND YOU'RE AGAINST THAT? WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? I'M A COMPLICATED DUDE. YOU CAN'T HANDLE TAKING ORDERS FROM ME. THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU'RE NOT IN CONTROL, SO YOU'RE UNDERMINING ME. WHY ELSE WOULD YOU WANT TO PROTECT THIS JERK? BECAUSE HE'S GOT KIDS, OKAY? LOOK, WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, I IDOLIZED MY FATHER. ONCE DAY, ME AND SOME FRIENDS, WE SKIPPED SCHOOL, AND WE WERE HANGING OUT IN THE CITY, AND I SAW HIM COMING OUT OF A HOTEL, KISSING ANOTHER WOMAN. I NEVER TOLD ANYONE ABOUT IT, AND I NEVER LOOKED AT HIM THE SAME WAY AGAIN. I KNOW WHEELER'S A SLEAZE, BUT I DON'T WANT HIS KIDS TO FIND OUT BECAUSE OF ME. YOU'VE HELD ON TO THIS PAIN FOR SO LONG. GO AHEAD. LET IT OUT. IT'S OUT. THAT EXPLAINS SO MUCH. I MEAN, DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHY YOU'RE WITH SO MANY WOMEN? NO, I JUST REALLY LIKE SEX. THESE PICTURES MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO GIVE US THE ELECTION. I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WAS A PSYCH MINOR IN COLLEGE, AND IF YOU EVER WANT TO SIFT THROUGH YOUR REPRESSED FEELINGS ABOUT YOUR FATHER -- CHARLIE! HEY, STUART. I WAS, UH, THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID, AND YOU'RE RIGHT. SO YOU'RE GONNA STOP WEARING THOSE RED LEATHER PANTS? I WAS SO BUSY THINKING ABOUT MY OWN PROBLEMS, I COULDN'T SEE HOW MUCH THIS MEANT TO YOU. I'M REALLY HAPPY YOU FOUND EACH OTHER. REALLY? YEAH. SHE'S AN AMAZING WOMAN. SHE'S WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE. MY MOTHER SAID THE SAME THING. WHAT ARE THOSE? I'VE DECIDED TO SEARCH FOR A NEW SURROGATE. I'VE DIVIDED THEM INTO THREE SEPARATE CATEGORIES -- PROFESSIONALS, ARTISTS -- WHAT ARE THOSE? BAD FASHION SENSE. HEY, GUYS. HEY, MICHELLE. CARTER, I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT THINKING ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL. IT'S A HUGE COMMITMENT, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. I'LL PROBABLY BE MOODY ALL THE TIME. I'LL BE SICK EVERY MORNING. MY BREASTS WILL GET HUGE. THERE ARE A MILLION REASONS WHY I SHOULDN'T DO THIS. BUT I WANT TO ANYWAY. WHY? I CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE WHO DESERVES TO BE A FATHER MORE THAN YOU DO. AND HELPING YOU GET THERE COULD BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS I EVER DO IN MY LIFE. YOU OKAY WITH THAT, STUART? WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND IF ANYBODY HAS TO KNOCK UP MY GIRLFRIEND, I WANT IT TO BE MY GAY ROOMMATE. YOU KNOW... IN A STRANGE WAY, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. CHARLIE... YOU LOOK TERRIBLE. I WAS OUT LATE WITH MANDY. I'M TOO OLD TO BE FOOLING AROUND IN VANS. I'M NOT 29 ANYMORE. HERE ARE THE PICTURES. HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT YOU WANT TO DO? NO. I KEEP GOING BACK AND FORTH. [ DOOR OPENS ] SO, CRAWFORD... I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE SOME PICTURES. WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO WITH THEM? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I PLAN TO DO WITH THEM. I'M GONNA SEND THEM TO THE PAPERS AND WATCH YOU GO DOWN IN FLAMES. THEN WE'VE GOT NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT. WAIT. WHY SHOULD I STOOP TO YOUR LEVEL? I'M NOT GONNA USE THE PICTURES. OKAY. ON THE OTHER HAND... I'D DO ANYTHING TO GET WINSTON RE-ELECTED. THEN AGAIN, THIS IS NOT HOW I WANT TO DO IT. I'M LOST. ARE WE USING THE PICTURES OR NOT? I DON'T KNOW. I THINK I WORKED MYSELF INTO A CORNER. HOW AM I LOSING TO YOU GUYS? YOU'VE GOT KIDS, AND THEY DON'T NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS, SO I'M NOT USING THE PICTURES. BUT... OH, JEEZ! I'M NOT GIVING THEM TO YOU EITHER. IF YOU TAKE ANY MORE SHOTS AT THE MAYOR... I WILL BURY YOU. NICE. WHEN I WIN, THERE MAY BE A PLACE FOR YOU IN MY ADMINISTRATION. [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] I'M SORRY I MADE THIS SO DIFFICULT. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LET MY... PERSONAL ISSUES AFFECT OUR WORK. IT'S REFRESHING TO SEE YOU LIKE THAT. ON THE OUTSIDE, YOU HAVE THIS MACHO SHELL, AND ON THE INSIDE, YOU HAVE THIS... CREAMY FRUIT FILLING? SENSITIVE SIDE. YOU HAVE SO MANY DEEP, REPRESSED ISSUES. LET IT OUT. IT'S OUT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT DEBATE. WE NEED SOMETHING SHARPER. HOW ABOUT THIS -- "WHEELER'S MAMA IS SO FAT WHEN SHE DANCES, THE RADIO STATION SKIPS"? DOESN'T QUITE POP, DOES IT? HERE WE GO -- "WHEELER'S MAMA'S SO FAT, ON HALLOWEEN, SHE SAYS 'TRICK OR MEATLOAF.'" SNAP. SIT, UBU, SIT. GOOD DOG. (BARKING) MOO. Strangers are here! Strangers again! The vibrant colours of Turkey, have given way to the colour of death with incredibly high speed. Death by pneumonia! In the past 6 months, the disease has claimed 2049 lives, in the Bursa region alone. Although pneumonia is not infrequent in third world countries. This outbreak in Turkey is highly uncommon. The United Nations Health Organization, has dispatched a delegation of 4 International scientists, on a field trip to the desert of Anatolia, to find out what possibly went wrong. The Turkish government invited 26 nations, to their National Day. Hello! Someone's here. Park Won Jung. It's still warm. You'll be too fat, to reel in the rich guys? Customers! Your intuition again?

So I left! If I were in America! I could have joined the army. Or the FBI! Or even the CIA! I could be a spy! are we fighting a non-contagious disease, that's been spreading, but we've been searching for its source in its wrong place. Frank, get to Riverdale. Find anything that ties the victims there to the victims in Willemet. All right. I found Carla's birth mom. Her name is Cyndi Weaver. According to her records, she was an unwed teenager who gave the child up at birth a little over ten years ago. There's no mention of a father. She's married now. She lives at Covington estates. I'm sure this is one knock on the door she wasn't expecting so soon. Try one she was never expecting. On her surrender form terminating her parenthood, she checked the box that said she never wanted to be contacted regarding the child, ever. You guys are early for pickup, but just in time for cake. No, we, we're not here to pick up any children. We're here to talk to Cyndi Weaver. Oh, it's Cyndi Harmon now. - Just a sec. - Thank you. Honey, door's for you. Hi. Can I help you? I'm Dr. Stephen Connor. This is Eva Rossi. We're from the national institutes of health. What's going on? We're here to talk to you about one of your children. Is there something wrong with one of my boys? It's not your boys. It's a girl. Your daughter. Daughter? No, I don't have a daughter. I have two sons. We're talking about the daughter you gave up for adoption a little over ten years ago. Adoption? This is some kind of mistake. She's very sick. She needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. - Well, you have the wrong person. - Your maiden name is Weaver? Right? From Lexington? Yeah, but I never had a daughter. Honey? Come on, we've got a pinta to bash. Oh, they were just leaving. Good luck to you. She's lying. And this is gonna prove it. Hey. How's she doing? Miles says she's a fighter. She's not gonna give up. Sounds like someone I know. If she does make it, without family, it's not gonna be pretty. You don't get adopted at ten. You bounce around from foster home to foster home. It's just not fair. - It's her, isn't it? - Cyndi Weaver is Carla's mother. DNA doesn't lie. How could a mother not want to help their child? I have my theories, but don't get me started. We need to get this woman in here, type her marrow. - Carla needs her. - I'll get her here. All right, including Carla and her father, we have six cases in Willemet. We now know there were two other cases before this 30 miles north in Riverdale. One retired contractor, one college coed. Add that to the background diversity of these victims in this local cluster, and we have nearly every walk of life covered. The only thing we don't have is someone alive to talk to, to see how these people all fit together. We have one. A transfusion could give Carla enough strength to wake up. A transfusion could also reduce her ability to accept a bone marrow transplant. Connor, she's not creating any red blood cells as it is. It's only a matter of time before her marrow shuts down completely. At least if we try this transfusion now, she may be able to wake up and tell us something that will help us stop this thing. Hey, C? I don't like the risk either, but the kid has a point. Even if we can't save her, maybe she can help us save others from the same fate. Do it. Eva, whatever you do, make the sale. - I need to get to work. - And I need to talk to you. I knew you'd be back. Summa cum laude at Yale, recruited by the cream of the fortune 500 crop. An out-of-wedlock baby hardly fits into the plans of a high school sophomore going places like that. I'll be the first to admit, I was young and stupid getting pregnant in the first place. The truth is, I was drunk at a party. I don't even know who the father was. So giving her up for adoption was the best thing for the girl and, yes, for me. The girl's name is Carla. Don't make it sound like I, I threw her in the trash or tried to sell her to the highest bidder. No, it wasn't like that. She shares your gift for music, by the way. I never saw her when she was born. I forced myself not to look at her. I was afraid she'd look at me. I knew if our eyes met, I'd never let her go. They told me she was adopted by good people. She was one of the lucky ones, but her luck has run out. Both of her parents have died in the last few days. Her mother of a long-term illness, and her father of the same disease that's killing her. You said something yesterday about, uh, bone marrow? She has aplastic anemia. It means that her bone marrow doesn't work. And she's not responding to medicine. If she doesn't get a transplant soon, she'll die. Okay, you can't just walk in here and drop that on me. Your husband and sons, they don't know, do they? No. No one in this life does. That's why I waited for them to leave. And, and how do you expect me to explain this to my husband and to my boys with no warning? That I created all of this based on a lie? You don't have to tell your family. You don't have to look at Carla, but only you can save her life. Any word from Eva? Nothing yet. I've got a bone marrow specialist standing by if... when Carla's donor comes in. - She's waking up. - Get Powell. Carla? Carla, can you hear me? Can you open your eyes? There you go. Where am I? You're in a hospital. My name's Dr. Connor. Where's my dad? He and your mom aren't here right now. But they'd want me to take care of you. Am I sick? Yes, Carla, just like your daddy. I need to ask you about places that you and your dad may have gone to lately. Or things you may have done that you normally wouldn't have. I'm really tired. Just stay with me just for a few more questions, okay? And then I'll let you rest. Has your dad taken you anyplace where there may have been a lot of chemicals? Like a factory. My dad works at home and except for school, piano and soccer, we're usually there. All right. What about soccer? Have you seen anyone spreading fertilizer on the field you know, to help the grass grow? If they did, it didn't work. The field's mostly dirt. Carla? My dad got that for me, my birthday. He brought it when mama took me to the river. You went to a river? I invited my dad... for a picnic. She wanted us to be a family again. But they fought. They always fight. That must not have been a very fun picnic. Except for me and my dad went swimming. You and your dad swam in the river? For a little while. The water didn't smell very good. Why don't you get some rest now? If you need anything, there'll be someone right out here for you, okay? Thank you, Carla. There's a river near Willemet. 20 minutes upstream on its banks in Riverdale, the town where the second cluster developed. Check it out, Frank. Was that really fair? What are you talking about? Lying to Carla about her mom and dad, suggesting they're still alive. Aren't you just setting her up for an even bigger fall? That little girl just lost both of her parents and you want to talk to me about being fair? The only thing I'm concerned about right now is saving that little girl's life, and when I do, then I'll tell her the truth. Riverdale, Maryland Truth is, my husband loved being out on that river more than being home. I'm sorry for your loss. Fred was a good man. You take these from the river? Yes, ma'am. Your husband must've loved to fish. Every day. He worked his whole life so he could spend his ... last years putting a line in that dirty water. - Dirty? - Gower chemicals, two miles up. Turned every fisherman on the river into catch and release. Their insecticides must work. I haven't seen a cricket around here in three years. The plant's right on the river. Saw it myself. The EPA confirmed to me they were cited a year ago for excessive benzene waste output into the river. All right, the dead fisherman I get, but what about the coed? I talked to her parents again. Turns out... she spent the last few months of her life working as a water-ski instructor. On the river. You got it. Nice work, Frank. Duran. / Nat, we're looking for benzene. Double-check Carla and her father's blood and pray like hell it's there. Dr. Connor! What happened? / Out of nowhere, her blood pressure plummeted! She could be septic. Push I.V antibiotics. Mask her. Her resps are too high. She's in V-fib. Defibrillator! Stay with us. Stay with us. Clear! No change! / Again! Clear! Normal sinus rhythm. Push the bicarb and dopamine. If her heart rate drops, give her atropine. Miles, keep pushing the antibiics. We got to stop this infection long enough to buy us some time. Unfortunately, time is something we're still gonna need. I'm sorry, Stephen. She wouldn't come. She's showing early signs of heart failure. Shortness of breath, fluid in the lungs. Her immune system is practically nonexistent. Another bacteria invades her body, she won't make it. Connor. I found something. Hey. / Hey. I did a GC-mass spec analysis of blood samples from both Carla and her father. Were they positive for benzene? The blood tested negative for benzene, but I found a nitrobenzene compound. What do you think, chloramphenicol? It was under the rock the whole time, we just never knew where to look. What the hell is chloramphenicol? It's a powerful antibiotic, and it's been known to cause aplastic anemia. So how did it get into the little girl and her father? Other countries use it in livestock to keep their animals healthy. Imports containing traces aren't supposed to be allowed in the country. You can't inspect everything that comes in. It's in a variety of products, chicken, crayfish, shrimp. It's even found in milk and honey. You don't need a high dose of it to cause aplastic anemia. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait a minute. The retired contractor from Riverdale, the guy who fished all the time... according to his autopsy, he had undigested shrimp in his stomach. Can I talk to you? My family thinks I'm visiting a friend for the weekend. So you have me until Monday morning. But I need to know that you're sure about this. Because once the procedure starts, there's no backing out. I'm not backing out. I'll do whatever you want. But as I told Ms. Rossi, it's all on one condition. I don't want to see the little girl, and I don't want her to see me. Okay. You really think that's what got my husband sick? That's what I'm gonna find out. Did you eat any of these? I'm allergic to crustaceans. But Fred couldn't get enough of them, he ate them like peanuts. He had them damn near every day for lunch. There's no markings on this bag. Do you have any idea where he got them? I think he picked them up down in Willemet, but I have no idea where. Vitals? B.P., heartbeat, respiration as stable as we can hope for. - How's the mother's marrow? - Clean. We should be ready to transplant in a few minutes. - Connor. - Yeah, look, it has to be the shrimp. Any idea how it ties into Carla and the dad? No, I'm not for sure, but I know there weren't any shrimp in dad's house. Are you positive? Absolutely. If we're sure it's chloramphenicol in the shrimp, where did they ingest it? Hell if I know. What about Carla's mom? There was no food in that house, except for toaster pastries and sugar cereal. Wait a second, what about take-out? Take-out? For the picnic at the river. We know Carla and her dad ate there together. I'll call you back. Picnic, what do I know about a picnic? You were her friend. Carla said her mom had her dad meet them at the river. Yeah, I remember that. She brought food. Do you have any idea where she got it? I gave her all the leftovers from the happy hour from the day before. Which was shrimp. Yeah, peel and eat. Who's your supplier? - Why? - Who's your supplier? Ming distribution. It's about a mile from here. The guy imports from Southeast asia, it's really cheap. Yeah, but it's also deadly. If you have any left, I suggest you dump it. Most of the marrow's infused. One more unit and we're done. Stephen, her breathing. Get a mask on her. Hives. She's having an allergic reaction to the marrow. We need to stop the procedure now. - No, she needs the marrow. - Her B.P.'s dropping. She's going into anaphylactic shock. We need to take care of this now. She will die without the marrow. Nurse, push epinephrine, benadryl and steroids. Right away. Let's hope for the best. I found the source of the shrimp. A seafood importer from Vietnam. He's been shut down, shrimps been recalled, the word's out. Good work, man. How's the kid? Touch and go. Well, that has to be a good sign. Hey. How are you feeling? Hungry. Miles, get this young lady something to eat. Happy to. Where's my mom and dad? Did she... Did Carla... is she okay? Why don't you look for yourself? Hey. - You okay? - I'm fine. You sure? I'm fine, Stephen. What was it like for you? You know... when you knocked on your birth mother's door? She didn't answer. Thanks for coming, guys. Really. Of course. It was a great party. I'll miss you. It's only six months. I know, but... It's Virginia Beach, not South America. You'll have a great time, and we will come visit. Thanks, Oscar. You sure everything's okay with you and Greg? He just drank a bit too much. Okay. I love you. I love you, too. She kissed me in the morning. She said she was gonna call me when she got to Virginia. I never heard from her. When the people from the program called last night... to ask where she was, I started getting really concerned. What was this program? Julie's a marine biologist. She had gotten a grant through the University of Virginia... to do a six-month expedition at Virginia Beach. Why didn't she take her scuba gear? - What? - Her scuba gear. That was too heavy for her to take on the train. She didn't have to be in the water until next week... - so I was just gonna send it to her. - Right. What time did you say she left yesterday? Around 8:00, I think. I was a little groggy in the morning. And the train left Grand Central at... At 9:00. How was she getting to the train station? - Taxi. - Was she taking a car service or a cab? I'm not sure. I think she was just gonna hail a cab. We talked to the doorman. He said he never saw her leave the building. That doesn't make any sense. Maybe she took the freight elevator. That goes down into the basement, out into the alley, right? I doubt it. I don't know why she would have gone out that way. We also checked her credit cards. She never purchased a train ticket. She could have paid cash, right? Somebody called and made reservations first class. They were very specific about the seating arrangements... but nobody ever picked up the ticket. Are you guys telling me that she never even made it to Grand Central? Oddly, a redcap found her suitcase on the platform going to Virginia Beach. Oh, my God. This is insane. We know you work at the Canal Street Community Shelter, yeah? Yeah. Did Julie ever go there? She volunteered there sometimes. That's how we met. Is there anyone there who could be dangerous? - No. - Anyone that you can think of... maybe she became friends with... talked to about her plans, anything like that? Not that I can think of, no. - And there was no one unfamiliar... - Jack. We checked their phone records. Turns out that a man placed a call from here to a car service at 4:00 a. M... the night she disappeared... and canceled her scheduled pickup for the morning. - It's not looking so good for him. - No. - I'll go ahead and rally Forensics. - Okay, great. Excuse me, Mr. Knowles. Would you mind coming to our offices? What for? We need to send some agents in to check for evidence. It'll be more comfortable if you come with us. - Evidence? - Technically... this is the last place that Julie was seen. No. Sure, of course. I'll just grab my coat. I don't know what is was, but something strange was going on that night. - Strange how? - I can't explain it exactly. There was just this weird dynamic. - Between who? - Greg and Julie. And Greg's brother, too. Come on, now. You'll have to wait till we leave. Obviously, it's easy to confuse them, them being twins. Wait for what? Oh, God. Is that Rick? I'm sorry. This is just too weird. How do you think we feel? I don't know what it was, but she was off. Do you think Julie was sleeping with Rick? No. I was only joking about that. She loves Greg. Okay. What happened after that? Next thing I saw, she and Greg were going at it. Why don't you just ask him and find out... - What's that about? - I don't know. April. Oscar. You promised me! Who told you about that? Almost everybody at the party saw it. We were just wondering why you never mentioned it. Because it was just a spat. It was nothing. About what? Julie thought I was flirting with one of her friends. It was just a misunderstanding. Three different people heard Julie say the words... "you promised me" during that argument. Really? Apparently, the argument was quite agitated. What did you promise her? It must have been the context of me promising... I wouldn't make it difficult for her to go away. Did you promise her you weren't gonna drink anymore? Is that what the fight was about? Yeah, maybe that was part of it. I'm sorry, I wish I remembered better. Do you have a drinking problem, Greg? I used to. Some of her friends think that you still do. Since I've been with Julie, it's gotten a lot better. I don't drink too much at all anymore. The night of the party was an exception. Greg, how did you and Julie meet? At the shelter. I was organizing a Thanksgiving dinner, and she volunteered. Love at first sight. - For me it was, yeah. - Not for her? To be honest with you, I think Julie was impressed with my philanthropy. Surrounding yourself with homeless people can be pretty sexy. - Is it okay if I smoke? - No, it isn't. Right. That's okay. I figured. Greg, what kind of a relationship does Julie have with your brother? - What do you mean? - Are they close? Yeah, they get along fine. They don't really see each other when I'm not around. Rick volunteers sometimes at the shelter. - So the three of you socialize. - Sure. Sometimes. And when was the last time that happened? Rick made us dinner over at his apartment last week. Do you think Rick and Julie ever discussed your problems? Julie and I didn't have any problems. - Didn't. - What? You just said the word "didn't" have any problems. Past tense. You didn't say "don't," present tense. - Did I? - Yes, you did. Well, we didn't, and we don't. Julie and I have a normal relationship. Right. Do you and Rick have similar taste in women? How do you mean? Isn't it a fact that identical twins, even ones that have been... separated at birth, often marry women that look very similar? Sometimes they even have the same name. I'm sorry. I don't understand your point. One of Julie's friends got the impression that Rick and Julie were flirting. No. Julie wouldn't flirt with Rick. She'd never do that. - Do you think your brother might... - No. No. Is it possible that Julie called Rick from your apartment after the party? No. We have telephone records here that indicate that somebody made a call... from your apartment at 2:32 a.m. Four minutes. I don't know. I must have been sleeping. Okay. If you'll excuse us for a minute. I just can't figure out why he hasn't asked for a lawyer yet. Guilty conscience. Wants to confess. I don't know, Jack. Everyone we've talked to... all of his friends, everyone who knew them... says he loves her. It wouldn't be the first time that a man killed the woman he loved. He's hungover, he's tired. I think we've got him for a couple more hours, tops. In a few hours we're gonna have to read him his rights. Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Knowles. That's all right. - Where's my brother? - He's downstairs. We're just wrapping up an interview with him. - Please take a seat. - Sure. It's so terrible, what happened. It's like a woman can't go anywhere alone these days. Do you think that Julie was having an affair? I don't know. I doubt it. Why do you ask? Are you attracted to her? You're kidding, right? She's an attractive woman, isn't she? She lives with my brother. One of Julie's friends saw you hitting on her at the party. - Who? April? - What were you and Julie talking about? I was telling her how happy I was for her and Greg. - You guys are great together. - I know. I'm just nervous about being away so long. He loves you, Jules. When you get back, I think he's gonna propose. - Really? - Absolutely. And he'll be a lucky guy. Thanks, Rick. According to this person, you were flirting with her. Well, this person is wrong. I gave her a hug. Platonically. Your brother, Greg, has indicated that you and Julie were quite close. - No, he didn't. - Excuse me? He didn't say that because it's not true. I hardly know Julie. They've been dating for nearly two years... and living together for 10 months. I know her through Greg, but we haven't spent any time together. We're certainly not close. Then why'd she call you that night at 2:30 a.m.? She didn't. Someone called you from their apartment. The phone records confirm you talked for five minutes. Greg called me. He was cleaning up. He just wanted to chat. Interesting, because he doesn't remember talking to you. Yeah. Greg tends to drink a little bit too much sometimes. Things can get a bit hazy for him. Is your brother the jealous type? You guys think that Greg did something to Julie... because she and I are having an affair. We're just asking you questions, Mr. Knowles. No, you're fishing. That's what you're doing. And I'm not gonna take the bait. Good for you. Excuse me. - So you're the caddy? - Excuse me? He's Tiger Woods, and you're the caddy. You're very perceptive. - Why don't you take a seat? - Sure. You're not the least bit nervous, are you? Why should I be? Your brother's girlfriend's missing, he's the prime suspect... and you're here at the FBI being questioned. - My brother's the prime suspect? - You know he is. Let me ask you something. - You have a brother? - What's your point? Well, if you did, would you protect him, no matter what? - Not if he killed someone. - Right. You have a higher code. That's what they teach you at Quantico. You don't learn morality at Quantico. I'm gonna keep looking for an article about caddies in here. They don't seem to write about that. There was this guy at the party... who spent the whole night taking pictures. Okay, look at this picture. Here's one of them. You see the lamp on the end table? Okay, this picture was taken by one of our photographers tonight. Same angle, no lamp. I just spoke to Viv. There's no sign of the lamp anywhere in the apartment. Nobody remembers anybody taking the lamp or breaking it... - or anything like that? - No way. Did we double-check the dumpsters behind the building? There's nothing there. We're checking the others in the neighborhood. - Bad news. - A body? Yeah. But not Julie Cochran. Anne Mathis. She's a homeless woman from Canal Street Community Shelter. She disappeared from there three weeks ago. Washed up on the shore of the Hudson River four days later. She was slipped a roofie and strangled. I'm assuming you asked Greg about possible suspects... - or strange events at the shelter? - Yes, Danny, I did. And he forgot to mention this. Apparently so. That's Anne Mathis. - Why didn't you tell us about it, Greg? - I don't know. I guess I just didn't want to... think that the same thing could have happened to Julie. - I don't suppose you know who killed her. - No, of course not. - Did you even know she was missing? - Yeah, we all did. But that's pretty much par for the course for the shelter. We filed a report, but the police didn't pay any attention. It makes them ideal victims, doesn't it? The homeless. - No one deserves to die like that. - No. They don't. But what I'm saying is, it's a lot easier to get away with... if that's what you like to do. I suppose. What happened to the lamp? What lamp? White porcelain lamp in your living room. It's missing. - It broke. - When? When we were cleaning up, I was drunk... and I stumbled into the table, and it broke. - Where is it? - I threw it out. - Where? - I don't remember. You don't remember? No, I had a lot to drink. - Yes, you already said that. - No, wait. Julie was gonna take out the garbage on her way out in the morning. But it wasn't in the dumpster. - I don't know. That's strange. - Yes, it is, isn't it? Like I said, I was passed out. Julie came in, kissed me goodbye, and left for the train station. With a lamp that nobody can find. In a car that was cancelled from the phone in your apartment at 4:00 in the morning. She cancelled the car service? No, a man did, and I'm assuming it was you. - It wasn't me. - Then, if it wasn't you... was another man in your apartment at 4:00 a.m.? - I don't know. - You don't know? No, I don't. I swear to God. Maybe. - Maybe? - I don't know. Excuse me. We found the lamp. - I'll be right out. - Okay. Sit tight. It was in a dumpster three blocks from Greg's apartment... wrapped in a bloody sheet. Preliminary forensics say that it's AB negative, the same as Julie's. The same as some traces of blood that we found on their apartment floor. Did they find the duffel bag? - The bag for the scuba gear? - No. She's petite, right? She's about 5-foot tall. She could easily fit in a bag like that. Tough for him to get her out of there on his own, don't you think? That's what I think the phone call to the brother was about. Jack. According to the police report... Anne Mathis was wearing a necklace with a ruby medallion... the last time she was seen at the shelter. People who knew her say it was a keepsake. - She never really took it off. - Okay. When they found the body, she wasn't wearing it. - So where did you find it? - In Julie's bag. Here's the thing. What if Julie found this in their apartment? She starts thinking maybe Greg killed Anne... kept the necklace as some sort of trophy. She confronts him, he kills her. He's 43 years old. If he likes killing women... the chances are Anne Mathis is not the first. - I'll get into it. - Yeah. I'll keep this. Pretty gruesome. - Do you know her? - No, not really. Greg and Julie were pretty upset about what happened to her. - What's that? - It belonged to her. Anne Mathis. - She was wearing it when she was killed. - Greg didn't kill that girl. She's not a girl. She's a woman. She's 46 years old. I don't care what she is. Greg didn't kill her. I think he did. And he killed Julie because she found out about it. - You wanna know how he did it? - Sure. He smashed Julie over the head with a table lamp. He called the car service, cancelled it... stuffed her body into a scuba bag, took her down in the freight elevator. The only thing I can't figure out is what he did with the body. That's where I think you can help me. - Me? - He talked to you that night. My guess is he was asking for your help. No. I think I would have remembered that, Jack. Mr. Knowles, we're going to find that body, and when we do... we're gonna prosecute your brother to the full extent of the law... and I'm going to assume that you had something to do with it, or knew about it. And I'm gonna charge you with accessory to murder. Even if that were true, do you honestly think I would turn against him? He's my brother. We're from the same egg. And you cannot break that. No matter how long you keep me here. No matter what kind of games you play. A few more hours, and we lose Greg. We may not need to worry about that. - Why not? - Because I think Rick's the killer... not the accomplice. What? First of all, Rick's a pharmaceutical rep... and Anne Mathis was drugged with a roofie. But you don't have to be in pharmaceuticals... to get your hands on Rohypnol. Secondly, I've been cross-referencing his travel records... against unsolved female homicides and disappearances, and I found six. One in Hartford, one in Boston, one in Philly, one in Providence... and two in Baltimore. In every case, he was in the same city as the crime for a very short period. - What about the women? - Two of them are still missing. But the other four? They were found in nearby bodies of water. They were strangled. There was no sign of sexual assault... and there were traces of Rohypnol in their bloodstream. And get this. They were all homeless. - Six women. - Eight, if you count Julie and Anne. Martin, if you're right, this means Greg is covering for Rick. Think about that for a second. Rick kills his girlfriend, and he's still covering for him. They're twins. - So what was it like? - What? - Growing up with a twin? - It was great. We've always been very close. So I noticed. According to this... you applied early to the University of Michigan. - He followed you there. - Right. - It's a great school. - Then you both moved to New York. Moved to the East Village. - Two blocks apart. - Right. Then you both got married. - That tends to happen. - Three months apart. Then you got divorced, one month apart. It would seem that he followed you around. I suppose. I had a bit of a jump on him. I was a couple minutes ahead of him out of the womb. So you're the dominant one? Either that or he was more attached to Mom. What about your dad? I think you know that my dad died when we were kids. - When you were seven, right? - You got it. So I assume that both of you were pretty attached to Mom. What's your point? From what I can tell, the only time that you and Greg... were really separated was between the age of 12 and 15. You were sent to Bridgewater Prep, he stayed at home with your mother. Yeah. Right. Why did she send you away, and not your brother? She didn't send me away. - What, you wanted to go? - Why is this relevant? I just thought we were having a conversation. Is it making you uncomfortable? It's not an issue of my comfort or discomfort. I just don't understand the point. Why did your mother send you away, and not Greg? I just told you, she didn't send me away. I read your transcript. You got yourself kicked out so you could go home to your mother. You don't like women much, do you? - I like women fine. - Really? What do you like about them? What do you like about women? I like the way they smell. I like the curve of their back. I like the glint in their eye, the bounce in their step. But most of all, I like the feeling that you get when you look at a woman... and you can see the little girl in her. Wow. - You've really thought about this. - And that's just off the top of my head. Give me a pad and a pen and 15 minutes... and I'll give you a complete dissertation. Now, what do you like? I think that's a bit too personal. That's a pity. I thought we were bonding. You think you understand me? Not by a long shot. But you think you can manipulate me. I think we're just having a conversation. - Do I need a lawyer? - Do you think you need one? - I'm not sure. - It's 4:00 a.m. Do you have one standing by? I thought we were just having a conversation, but... be my guest. - Has my brother asked for a lawyer? - No. Is he still downstairs? And he's been very cooperative. I'd like to talk to him. I can arrange that. - Martin. - This guy's a real prince. Yeah, well, I'm gonna need you to spend some time with him. He wants to see his brother. I need you to stall him. I'll do what I have to do. Jack. NYPD just found Julie Cochran's body. It was washed up on the Hudson River. She was beaten, strangled, and stuffed into a duffel bag. - Hey. - Hi. - Really? I thought... - It's okay. I just couldn't let you smoke while my boss was here. Thanks. - I might join you. - Do you smoke? Every now and then. I'm kind of trying to quit. You know, I should tell you at this point... you have the right to go home if you want to. I really appreciate how helpful you've been... and I would love to talk to you a little bit more. - But it's up to you. - It's okay. Where would I go? - Back to my empty apartment? - Right. So what was it like growing up in Providence? It was okay. Small, compared to New York. How about you? Where are you from? Kenosha, Wisconsin. Talk about small. Really? You don't have much of an accent. Yeah, I kind of worked really hard on that. - You have siblings? - Older sister. - Close? - We were. At one time. - You and your brother are close. - Yeah. So, then, what was it like during that period when you were separated? What, do you mean when he was at boarding school? Well, my mom just thought it would be better. - Better for him, or better for you? - For both of us. Yeah. Gave us a chance to develop on our own. That didn't take? No, it was good. Those were okay years. I used to sense what he was feeling sometimes. Like I'd get these images, flashes. Like there was this one time I was in the yard helping my mom hang laundry. And I got this searing pain in my chest. I couldn't breathe. And two hours later... we got a call from his school saying he'd been in a fight... at exactly the same time. This kid had punched him in the chest, and knocked the wind out of him. It was strange. You guys are really linked. I can't imagine life without him. So Jack sent you to baby-sit while they arrange for me to see my brother? No, I just came to chat. I thought it might be fun. So how long you been doing this job? A couple of years. Bet you've seen a lot of ugly stuff. You could say that. - That ever get to you? - No, it's part of the job. It's amazing what human beings... are capable of doing to each other, isn't it? Yeah. It is. But, then again, if they weren't out there doing those things... you wouldn't have a job, would you? Yeah, I guess not. - So what about you, Rick? - What? - You like your job? - It's a living. - You get to travel a lot. - Yeah. Sure. A different woman in every city. After a while, one's the same as the next, right? Yeah, I'm sure. Here's the bag. And I just got some early forensics back on Greg's apartment. They found a wine glass with traces of Rohypnol in it. Thanks. Recognize that? We found your girlfriend stuffed inside it. We just fished her out of the Hudson. Rick killed Julie. He also killed Anne. - Why are you protecting him? - I'm not. I know he's your brother, but he is a monster. - He killed your girlfriend. - He didn't. You're gonna go down with him... - just as hard. So stop protecting him! - I'm not. I'm not. He didn't kill her. I did. I killed Julie. You killed Julie? - Why? - I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? Like I said, I had too much to drink, and... We were fighting. I must have blacked out, because the next thing I knew... I woke up and went into the living room, and there she was. I killed her. Okay. Then? You were right, obviously. I dumped her scuba gear out of her bag... and I put her into it. Then I took her down the freight elevator. And I put my car around, and I managed to get her into the trunk. What did you do with the body? I drove over to the West Side Highway, and I dropped it in the Hudson River. Greg, what did you do with the lamp? I threw it in a dumpster a couple blocks away. There's still one small detail missing. - What? - The phone call to your brother. Right. Yeah, I called him. After I found her body. But I didn't tell him what had happened. - Why not? - I was gonna ask him for help... but when I heard his voice, I just couldn't involve him. I managed to make small talk for a couple of minutes... and then I hung up. It wasn't the first time. It wasn't? When we were 12... there was this girl, Trisha Payton. She lived down the road from us. I had a crush on her. One day we were all hanging out at this old boathouse. Trisha, Rick and me. And she'd taken this bottle of Scotch from her dad's liquor cabinet. I was really nervous because I liked her. And I ended up drinking most of the bottle of Scotch. And then I think Rick took off, because he... He wanted to leave us alone. And so I kissed her. And she wasn't into it, and she pushed me away, and I... I don't know, I must have gotten really... really mad or something... because when Rick came back, I had passed out. And Trish was dead. I killed her. - And no one ever found out? - I told my mom. That's why she sent Rick away to boarding school. To protect him. From me. So I was reading one of those pamphlets in reception. Are you related to Victor Fitzgerald? He's your father, right? So your dad is the deputy director of the FBI. No wonder you have such a chip on your shoulder. That's funny, 'cause I was thinking the same thing about you. Yeah? What's that? Your father died when you were seven, right? That's right. It seems to me that you really could have benefited... by having another male role model in your life. Or did you have a parade of men coming in and out of your mother's house? Now don't start talking about my mother. What's the matter? Did I hit a sore spot? - She's dead. - Yeah. And so is Julie. And so is Anne. I think we've established that. What about the other six? I don't know what you're talking about. - You ever been to Baltimore? - Baltimore. Good crabs. Why? - What about Philly? - Cheese steaks. So what? I say Boston, you say chowder, right? You know, I don't think I want to talk to you anymore. I'm done. That's okay, because I don't need you to speak anymore. I'm gonna do the talking. This is a confession from your brother. Unfortunately, I can't let you read all of it... because some of it's gonna be used in the case against you. And what case would that be? That would be the murders of Wendy Bledsoe... Diane Vallone, Judith Kirschner... Penny Landon, Barbara Trent, and Katie Worth. So those are the six? Your caddy here was saying something about that. Was he really? Would you like to know what I think happened, Mr. Knowles? Sure. I think Julie found out that you killed Anne. That's what you were arguing about at the party. I found the necklace, Rick. The other night when we were at your place for dinner. Anne gave that to me. That was from her mother. Why the hell would she give it to you? I don't know. I guess she liked me. She barely even knew you. Julie, think about what you're saying. It's crazy. And then later, when Greg and Julie were fighting, it was over you. You promised me! You promised me that you would ask him about the necklace. I'm not gonna ask him about something I know he didn't do, okay? Now just drop this. And when you saw the two of them fighting... you thought it was the perfect opportunity to do what you had to do. You gave your brother a dose of Rohypnol. You waited for the party to end, the guests to leave. You hid out in the hallway. When they left, you snuck back into the apartment. You killed Julie, and you set it up to make it look like Greg did it. So why on earth would Greg confess? Because he remembers a little 12-year-old girl named Trisha Payton. He told me about her. That's what you were counting on, wasn't it? His guilt. But that's not gonna help you lay off those six murders onto your brother. Like I told you, I'm done speaking with you. And I'm done talking to you. I'll set it up so that you can see your brother. - What the hell is wrong with you? - What? I told you to stall him, keep him relaxed. Instead, you're in there provoking him. Ten more minutes I might have had the son of a bitch. Ten more minutes and he'd have been walking out of here. He would've called for a lawyer. We don't have a thing on him. - What about Greg's confession? - Greg confessed to killing Julie. I don't believe it. We're hanging on to Rick by a thread. I hear what you're saying, but I was in there... I saw an opportunity, and I took it. You took the wrong opportunity at the wrong time. I don't need you going off the rails in the eleventh hour. You got it? Yeah, I got it. Danny, you got that forensics report on the wine glass with the Rohypnol? - Actually, I have it right here. - Okay. How long before we get the coroner's report? Four, five hours. We're just gonna have to make up one of our own. - Greg, can I ask you something? - Sure. What was Julie drinking the night she was killed? Soda, I think. - Not wine. - No. Julie barely drank. Especially when she was getting ready for a dive. What were you drinking? Red wine. That's interesting. Let me show you something. This is a forensics report from your apartment. Now, we found a wine glass with traces of Rohypnol in it. Your brother sells pharmaceuticals, doesn't he? Now, whoever it was knew exactly how much... to give so that you wouldn't sleep through the night. So that you'd wake up after a couple of hours. Now this is a preliminary autopsy report on Julie. You see this? Traces of semen. Somebody had sex with her that night. - Was it you? - No. Now, you understand the implications of this, don't you? Your brother forced himself on her. You didn't do it, Greg. You didn't kill any of them. He's killed at least eight women. Eight. And he never raped any of them. Except for your girlfriend. Your brother's coming up here to see you. Is that okay? Yeah. I knew you'd cave. - You raped her? - Who? - Julie. - I didn't do anything to her. I loved her! Then maybe you shouldn't drink. I didn't do it. You did it. What are you talking about? - You killed seven other women. - No, Greg. - I didn't. - I loved her. You loved Trisha, too. You can't help yourself. It's in your nature. - It isn't. - Yeah. It is. Do you remember when I was on the road? And you'd come visit me sometimes? You'd drink, you'd drink too much, and you'd go out. And the next morning I'd ask you where you were... and you wouldn't remember. Well, every single time you'd go back to New York... and a couple of days later I'd read... in the local paper about some woman who was missing. Some body that washed up on shore somewhere. - No. - Yeah. I've been covering for you for all these years. I don't buy it. - I don't remember. - I know you don't. - That's the problem. - Oh, my God. Listen to me, Greg. Whatever you said to them, it was coercion. It was duress. They'd had you here for over nine hours. Did they offer you a lawyer? I didn't ask for one. - They told me I could go. - Listen to me. Whatever you told them, you recant it. We both get lawyers, and we both get out of here. How? We're from the same egg. That'll be enough. It's the DNA. They have the same DNA. 50% doubt is more than reasonable in any court. That's why he made sure Greg was everywhere he was. He makes the perfect alibi. Now he's the perfect scapegoat. We're gonna be all right. I know I didn't do it. And they can't prove that you did. It's just you and me, man. That's all that matters. No. - What do you mean, no? - I can't keep hiding from the truth. Greg, don't be stupid. We're gonna fight this. I can't have you fighting for me anymore. You just go live your life. - I want him out of here! - Get in there and break it up. Greg, don't do this. I'll talk to you, but I don't wanna talk to him anymore! - Greg, just calm down. - Let's go, Rick. Wait a minute. I wanna talk to my brother. - Let's go. - Greg! Jack, listen to me. He didn't kill anyone, okay? Not Julie. He didn't kill that girl when they were younger. We cannot let him take the fall for this. Do something. There's nothing we can do. I wanna get him a lawyer right now. That's gonna be up to your brother. You're free to leave. Agent Fitzgerald, would you escort him out, please? Samantha! I need to talk to you! Don't forget to read him his rights again. It's not like he's gonna ask for a lawyer, Jack. I want to remind you of your rights, okay? Yeah. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in court. You have the right to talk to a lawyer... [ Man #1 ] Don't sit so far away. - Anything that creates a distance should be avoided. - [ Man #2 ] Okay. And try not to frown. - I'm sorry. Was I frowning? - You have to relax. How can I be expected to open up if you're not relaxed? - Right. - Take a deep breath. Start again. As you can see, this piece of paper has been divided into squares. There are 287 of them. Your sex history will fit on this single page in a cryptic code. Don't forget to mention that there's no written key to the code. The interview subject will only be candid... ifhe knows he's speaking in the strictest confidence. Right. Okay. So, when were you born? June 23, 1 894. Are you single or married? Married. - What is your race? - Don't waste time asking the obvious, Martin. - Fill it in yourself. - What is your religion? - Methodist. - How often do you attend church? Not at all now, but I did regularly until I was 1 9. How did you get along with your father and mother when you were growing up? That's a multiple question. It allows me to ignore any part I don't want to answer. - How did you get along with your mother? - Fine. - We had a close relationship. - And your father? - How did you get along with your father? - [ Taps Glass ] [ Man ] And what are we to do? We turn away from matters of the flesh... and we turn to things... of the spirit. Lust... has a thousand avenues-- the dance hall, the ice cream parlor... the tenement saloon... the Turkish bath. Like the Hydra... it grows new heads everywhere. Even the modern inventions of science... are used to cultivate immorality. The gas engine... has brought us the automobile joyride... and an even more pernicious menace... the roadside brothel. Electricity... has made possible the degrading picture show. Because of the telephone... a young woman... can hear the voice of her suitor... on the pillow, right next to her. And let's not forget the most scandalous invention of all-- the talon-slide fastener... otherwise known as the zipper... which provides every man and boy speedy access... to moral oblivion. [ Man ] Are you currently in good health? I suppose so. Mm-hmm. What makes you doubtful? Every doctor I've ever seen. Early disease left me with a weakened heart. Did you have any illnesses that kept you out of school? I had typhoid fever and rickets. Also rheumatic fever. Measles, chicken pox, pneumonia... and several bouts of influenza. [ Clears Throat ] Pomeroy, what are you doing? You're worse than Martin. Never make judgments about people. I wasn't. Your body posture told me that my list of ailments made you uncomfortable. Maybe it did. Sorry. Maintaining a nonjudgmental attitude... is harder than you think. The best way is to smile, nod your head... while looking me directly in the eye. Where were we? Your health as a boy. It improved greatly when I finally discovered the outdoors. I never got over the excitement of setting off into the wild... escaping bed, illness, family. Alone? No. No. Never alone. I was surrounded by friends. Being in the outdoors taught me to rely on my own judgment. I started to learn about things by grasping them... tasting them, looking at them. - Biology? - Yes. Biology. The science oflife. The fields and woods became my new place of worship... my cathedral. The only sadness they brought was when I had to leave them. How old were you when you first tried to pleasure yourself? [ Sighs ] No. No. No euphemisms. If you're talking to a college graduate... use "masturbation," "testicles," "penis"... "vagina, " "vulva, " "urination, " "defecation. " With the lower-level male, it's "jacking off," "balls"... "prick, " "cunt, " "piss, " "shit. " I don't know, Gebhard. Maybe your Harvard degree is too ivory tower for our purposes. I was brought up out west. I've rubbed shoulders with ranchers, miners my whole life. - And I thought you were gonna shave that mustache. - I like it. It's a disguise, a cover-up. Look at any movie. The villain's always the one with the mustache. My wife likes it. You have a chance to make an important contribution to knowledge and science. Are you telling me you'd give that up for a little facial hair? Yes, I suppose I am. Ah. Well, keep it trimmed. Let's get back to masturbation. - [ Bird Cooing ] - That's a mating call. So, how'd you wind up at the Stevens Institute, Al? I thought you wanted to be a biologist. There are enough scientists in the world, son. Engineers are what society needs now. I, um-- I had one of the old fits again. I tried to stop it. "Any habit which causes the sex fluid to be discharged must be resisted. "Doctors link it to an assortment of illnesses... "including insanity, blindness, epilepsy... even death." What if it happens while you're asleep? "It is said that the loss of one ounce of seminal fluid... equals the loss of 40 ounces of blood." I'm killing myself, and I'm not even awake. What are we supposed to do? "Keep your bowels open... "read the Sermon on the Mount... "sit with your testicles submerged in a bowl of cold water... think of your mother's pure love." Why don't we pray. - [ Kinsey ] Come on. Keep firing questions. - [ Sobs ] - [ Kinsey ] Come on. Keep firing questions. - [ Sobs ] Extreme rapidity makes it very difficult for a subject to lie. How young were you the first time you had an orgasm while dreaming? - How frequently did you have wet dreams? - What did you dream about? How young were you when you first experienced hugging or kissing? - Necking? - Petting? - Oral sex? How young were you when you no longer thought of your parents' home as your own? [ Kinsey Sr.] Al, it's getting late. Let's make the rounds. - Al.! - Be right down! Pack of Fatimas. Okay, son. That'll be 1 5 cents. You're a criminal, sir. I shall report you at once to the local authorities. DearJesus, a goddamn Protestant. - Did you not sell this vile weed to a minor? - What business is that of yours? It is the Lord's work to protect the young from temptation. - Men like you, sir, men of weak character... - Get the hell out of my store. - I've given you proper warning. -are offensive to right-thinking American citizens-- Shut up! You know what you are, Father? A prig. - Al. - A skinflint, a petty tyrant and a hypocrite to boot! You think you matter? You don't matter. There's something wrong with him. - Come on, Al. - No. Maybe your workload is too heavy. You could drop mechanical drawing. I've withdrawn from Stevens. That's impossible. I'm a senior member of the faculty. Someone would've informed me. Why? Everyone there hates you. I'm going to Bowdoin to study biology. And how do you intend to pay for that? They've given me a partial scholarship. And I've socked away most of my scouting money. You've become a shady person, Al... a person who keeps secrets. I had no choice. What a disappointment you turned out to be. - [ Pomeroy ] How many years of schooling did you complete? - Twenty. After taking my undergraduate degree at Bowdoin... I received my doctorate from the Bussey Institute at Harvard. I took a position as assistant professor of zoology... here at Indiana University. At first I studied the Rhaetulus didieri... or stag beetle. Then I discovered a far more fascinating insect. [ Kinsey ] This is the American Cynipidae, or gall wasp. Here the wasp deposits an egg... into its host plant. In this case, an oak tree. The adult wasp chews its way through the tree... and copulates. At which point it has the good sense to die. The animal kingdom includes... at least two million insect species. So, what makes the gall wasp so fascinating? I've spent the last three years... crisscrossing the continent, collecting gall wasps. And what have I learned from my tiny friends, half the size of the household ant? [ Whispers ] That you need a date. - Shh! - [ Student Giggles ] After studying thousands of these pesky creatures under the microscope... I've yet to find a single gall wasp that's the same as another. In fact, some are so different... that the offspring of one generation... bear no more resemblance to their parents than a sheep bears to a goat. There are those of us who might take comfort in this fact. Consider the implications. If every single living thing is different from every other living thing... then diversity becomes life's one irreducible fact. Only variations are real. And to see them... you simply have to open your eyes. Hello. Mind if I sit here? Why? Because you're the only unattached male... and I'm the only unattached female. That's very sensible. A man who cooks. How refreshing. I picked it up when I went out west to collect galls. I was gone for 1 1 months, and I don't think I saw more than a dozen people the whole time. - Sounds lonely. - Oh. [ Chuckles ] I enjoyed it. I've been reading up on gall wasps. - I think I know why they appeal to you. - Uh-huh. They have great big wings, but they can't fly. They are incapable of getting from this hill to that hill... unless it's close enough to walk... which means it's possible... to retrace each generation's steps, hill by -I didn't mean- - Alan. Well, if-- if I got mad, I- - I'm sorry. -Well, that's better. In that case, welcome to the quietest little town on Earth. Winnicon, Ohio. -I'm sure you'll be comfortable here, Miss Weston. It's cheerful, isn't it? And you won't have to climb any stairs, if you're just out of the hospital. -What? -Oh, there. All I have to do is open my mouth and all the wrong things come out. Alan didn't want me to mention it about your being sick. -That's all right. -You come along and have your breakfast. -Oh, coffee. That's all I want. -Oh, girl just out of the hospital and only coffee. You're gonna have bacon and eggs and tell me all about yourself. [PHONE RINGING] Oh, excuse me. Hello? Yeah. Oh, yes. Oh. Yeah. Well, that'll be just fine. OK. Bye. That was Dr. Wall. He's on his way over. -Who? -Dr. Wall. Oh, I see. No, no. Not Alan Wall. Alan's uncle. He's the doctor here. -Oh. -I'm sure I raised that blind. -Oh, but I-- -Pretty day, isn't it? Real pretty kind of day. You come along and-- and have your breakfast. I'll have it ready in a minute. You go on in the parlor and turn on the radio. Music and a pretty day, they kind of go together. [MUSIC PLAYING] MRS. BAILEY: You like music? -Uh huh. -Well, what do you know? You're good. You're very good. [DOORBELL] Ah. DR. WALL: Good morning, Mrs. Bailey. MRS. BAILEY: Oh, good morning, but you can go back home now, Doctor. The patient's been dancing. M-- oh, Miss Weston. This is Dr. Wall. -Hello. Good morning. -It was just the music. I couldn't help it. -Alan, I thought you said the young lady was tense. Nervous. -Well, she was. Hello. -Hello. -Is it true about the dancing? -It was just the music. It-- it made me feel different. -Well, you don't look the picture of hypertension. Since I'm here, though, how about a check up? -Well, I won't do it again. -If Dr. Wall says it's all right, you most certainly will. -Mrs. Bailey means there's no law against it. -Shall we have the check up now? -All right. -Maybe after, you'd-- you'd like to take a ride? I'll wait for you in the kitchen. -Now, if you're ready. -Nobody disappears just like that, into thin air. -All right, so it's the first time in history. But she's gone, just like that. I ought to know. I looked. -Where? In a gin mill? -What's the matter with you? You're not the only person that doesn't like people disappearing into thin air. I don't like it, either. -Where'd you go? -Oh, every town along the way. Every place the train made a slow down for mail. I covered the whole line. A traveling salesman doesn't know it better. -Did you talk? Ask? You know, they've got station masters. -I talked. I asked. Nobody saw a girl get off a train from Abby Junction to Winnicon, period. -Rotten, crazy way to run a business. Leaving your biggest liability lying around for anyone to pick up? -Look, she ran, didn't she? She said she wouldn't tell the cops. Now, maybe it's just as well. Why don't you relax? She's not going to talk. She's scared. -Everybody stops being scared sometime. How do I know what that Honey's going to do? Even the dumb learn ways to speak. The blind wake up some morning and they can see. What is this advice you're giving me? Pearls of wisdom? -Well, what else do you want me to do? -I want to know where Honey is, and you're stalling me. -Ah. -You've got a yen for her. -Wait a minute. It was your idea to get rid of Dave Weber. Not mine. -Yes, it was. But I didn't know that she was going to witness it. Now, get this through your head. I'm not paving your way to that doll with my dead body, you understand? You stall with me, and you'll get it, too. -All right. All right. Relax. There's no reason for us to argue about it. The important thing is, what are we going to do now? -Mary Warren. -What? -Honey is just the kind to write letters. -Yeah. -Morning. -Well, now that's a how do you do I like to hear. My husband, God rest his soul, only knew how to grouch at this hour of the day. Best grouch in the county, I used to say. -It's a big county. -Yeah. -Is the mail maid here? -Got a letter, huh? No, not yet. Nice young man waiting for you out there, huh? -Mrs. Bailey? -What? -Why isn't he somebody? -What do you mean? -Well, his uncle's a doctor, and he just works at the station. Why isn't he somebody? -Well, nobody looks down on him. He's a grown man that-- -That's just it. A grown man-- -Ah, women in the kitchen. It's a good sign. Hello. -Hello. -Yeah, women in the kitchen mean food. Had your breakfast? -Yeah. -Well, have some coffee. -Poor it out, ma'am. Poor it out. You feel excited? -What? -You've got a sense of circuses, parades, giant spectacles? -What are you talking about? -It's in the air. Can you believe it, Mrs. Bailey? I've got a surprise for the lady. She can't even feel it. The communications are dead. The wires are down. -Surprise? -The local Houdini show's [INAUDIBLE]. Nothing up my sleeves. -Oh, Alan. How you talk. -It's a present, Francis. -Present? For me? Well, what? What is it? -Why don't you take a look? It's out in the hall. -Always I had to ask for things. Nobody just brought me anything. [MUSIC PLAYING] It's Mr. Callahan. How'd you know I liked it? -I thought you might. You like music an awful lot. -Makes you stop feeling lonely, like-- like you really are some place. -Like you're connected to something, huh? -Yeah, that's it. Like-- like a connect with something. When I was a kid, I used to do this all the time. You know, big family. Nobody ever having time for anybody else. Used to make me feel real good, like-- like I was somebody special. -You needed music to make you feel like something special in those [INAUDIBLE]. -Alan? Alan, why aren't you somebody? -What? -Why aren't you somebody? I mean, well, your uncle's a doctor, and-- and you work down at the station. Why aren't you somebody? -Well, I am somebody. I'm me. -That's not what I mean. You're-- you read a lot. You know a lot of things. You could be somebody important. -Inside myself, I am somebody important. -Oh, that's not what I mean. -Be somebody, huh? Well, that is your idea of what a somebody is. The example of the times. The model. The man with the limousine and the diamond cuff links. It's the way you grew up, Francis. The way you grew up. -What's that got to do with it? -Success. That's the word. Well, I am a success. I did what I wanted to do. Grow up, inside myself. Look, Francis. My name's Alan Wall. I live in Winnicon, Ohio. Why can't I be a man in the 20th century who doesn't want to own a yacht or drive the fastest car? Are those the signs of being somebody? The truth is they prove you're a nobody. -That's crazy. -Is it? Like kids. They join something to get a uniform, an award, a badge-- something to make them feel like somebody. That's self-protection. Well, I don't need those things to live by. -I-- I-- -Yeah? -Ah, you mixed me up. -You mix yourself up, Francis. You remember what I told you that night in the station? -What? -That there are a lot of ways of growing up? A lot of ways? Different kinds of growing up? -I don't know. It didn't seem like being nobody. It didn't seem like-- -What didn't? -Well, back in-- Oh, what'd you start all this for? Speeches, speeches. All the time, speeches. -You started it yourself. You must have had a reason. Francis, about me being somebody. Is it important to you? -No. Yes. Yes. MRS. BAILEY: Francis, I can't keep the eggs warm much longer. -I'm coming. -Look, how about having dinner with me tonight at the station? About eight? -Do you dance? Do ya? Huh? -What are you doing? Well, well. I thought I saw a manhole with the cover left off the top. May I help you? Any old mascara? Recipes? Last Sunday's crossword puzzle? -Where is she? -Look, I know you know where she is. She's written you letters, and I want to know where those letters are. -Why, Skeets. I didn't know you could write. -You know the boss, Timashin? -Unfortunately. -Well, he owns this place. I happen to have influence with him. -I've had it. -You know, you could be out of work a long time. Now quit stalling. Where is she? Don't make it tough on yourself. -Look, there's something I want you to know. During the last conflict, I riveted ships together for a living. There was lots of fresh air on that job. That's something I've been missing around here. Now, you get out. -OK, baby. I'll be seeing you. -Not if I see you first. -No limousines. No yachts. But you do dance to the best bands. -Yeah, at the old Winnicon, the fanciest night spot in the world. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I learned at school, when I was a freshman and everything. -I bet you think I'm still pretty much of a kid. -Well, it's not that. It's just that everyone should have a solid beginning. A place from which to start growing. So it's all one motion, and not a hop, skip, and a jump, or a zig zag. You know, you may not believe it, but besides dancing, I can also sing beautiful things. Like the night's a funny thing. What comes out of it, I mean. Everything in it can come roaring and rushing up, and then suddenly, standing silently on the platform's a girl. And the first thing you want to know is, what's her name. What's her name? Well, the world's full of lonely people, and everybody in it needs each other. Look, you're afraid to talk. -Please talk. I want to hear you talk. Where did you come from? Who'd you know? What did you do, once upon a time? -I live a good life. -That's not once upon a time, that's now. Right now. I should've known you. Once upon a time. -Honey. Honey. Honey! -What did you call me? You called me Honey! -This came three days ago. Go to the police, Honey. -Are you crazy? -No. Don't slip back. I didn't tell you because I wanted you to know I love you first. -And now you want to get me killed. -No, change. I want you to change. But hold on to what you've got. All kids get scared. Kids run away. Where do you think you can run to? -Out. Away. Before they get to me. Before they kill me. -You've got to go to the police. -Police. Police. What do you know about it? Sitting inside this crate, a million miles from anywhere. Reading. Talking. I'm going to go before they kill me. -You can't keep on running. I'm leaving. Three days ago, and you've got to wait until now to tell me. -Because I wanted you to know who and what you really are. That the Honey Weber was a mistake. An accident. Something that happened to you without you even thinking about it. -Let me go. -Go to the sheriff. -Let me go. -You know, my husband, God rest his soul, never could face an egg first thing in the morning. He used to say, Mr. Jones, it was the sorrow of the hens. [MAN LAUGHING] Francis? There's a nice young man waiting to see you. -Hello. You may not remember me. I'm a friend of Dave Weber's. There's a friend of yours outside named Timashin. Now, uh, just what are you going to do about it? ANNOUNCER: And now let's pause a moment and look at our Westinghouse program and Betty Furness. Ever plug in your dinner? -No? Well, you can, just like this. If you own a wonderful Westinghouse electric roaster oven, it plugs in anywhere and it will cook a complete meal all at one time with these handy heat-proof glass dishes. And you can enjoy all your favorite menus, too. Here's a delicious dinner, for instance. Look at that first dish. It's a pork chop casserole. And then the second dish, baked potatoes. And here in the third dish, chocolate nut pudding for dessert. Then you just put on the lid. Set the dial at 375 degrees, and forget about it. In an hour, your dinner will be all ready, and your roaster oven will do everything but serve it. And the Westinghouse roaster comes in mighty handy as an extra oven, too. For instance, it's wonderful to roast your turkey, say holiday time or any time. Look, I want to show you something. Just look here. A great, big, luscious turkey, and plenty of room for it, too, in the Westinghouse roaster oven. You just set the dial at 300 degrees, and the roaster oven takes over. And then when that turkey comes to the table, all golden brown on the outside and succulent meat inside, well, I'll bet you'll say that the pilgrims should've had it so good. This 48-page cookbook comes right with the Westinghouse roaster oven, and it gives you lots of ideas. Everything from, oh, how to bake pies and cakes to cooking enough spaghetti and meatballs for 50 people. And the Westinghouse roaster oven is so inexpensive, too. It's only $42.95. And that price includes the 48-page cookbook and the heat-proof glass dishes. Go to your Westinghouse dealer tomorrow and ask to see one of these roasters. And remember, you can be sure if it's Westinghouse. ANNOUNCER: We return now to Westinghouse Studio One, and "Plan for Escape." -So east is east, and west is west. And we meet up anyway, huh? Thanks to the US mail and a lady named Mary Warren. -I won't tell, Skeets. I swear I won't tell. Oh I know you won't. -I'll go away with you. You want that, don't you, Skeets? I'll go with you. Stick with you. Timashin doesn't have to know. -That's for the smack on the head you gave me. Now, let's get out of here. I've been around here long enough. -Oh, let me stay, Skeets. I won't tell. I swear I won't tell. -Oh, you think I'm playing games? Let's go. -Francis, you're going out? -Yes, she's going. -Oh? -Now, look, lady. This is none of your business. -This happens to be my house. -Still, lady, it's none of your business. -Get out of here. -Get your things. Now look, lady-- -Get out of here. -You should never stick your nose where it doesn't belong. -If you make any trouble, and I'll call the sheriff. -I'll wait in here. -Francis, who is that man? -You've got to help me. Go in there. Give him anything. Give him something. -What is this? What's going on? -Keep him in there. Don't let him come in here. Everything's going to be all right, only I've got to get away. And I need time. Time! Go! -Now, just what do you want with that girl, anyway? -Lady, why don't you go cook something? Fry an egg or something. [GUNSHOTS] -The window, you fool She went out the window. She's running. Run! -Francis? Francis? Where are you? Francis! Hello? Operator? Operator! Get me the sheriff. The sheriff, quick! -Alan, I've got to get away. -What? -You've got to help me. They're here to get after me. They came to Mrs. Bailey's. Both of them. -What's the matter? Who? -They're coming. I've got to escape. -Oh, stop it. -They're coming. -What? -I've got to get away. -What? What is it? -Timashin's the one who killed Dave. He knows I saw him, and he's afraid. They'll kill me. I've got to get away, Alan. I've got to get away. -Did you call the sheriff? -I'm scared, Alan. -That's no reason for not calling the sheriff. Listen, did they follow you here? -For Pete's sake, say something. -Oh, don't let them hurt me, Alan. -Do you like yourself? Running scared? Trying to crawl into a corner? [CAR APPROACHING] They're here, all right. There's a car out there. Here. Here. Take this. Hurry up. Hide! TIMASHIN: Hey, why don't you open up in there? -I'll get 'em spun around and knocked up against the sides. TIMASHIN: Open up. Don't move, mister. There's someone coming around the other side. -She's not out here. TIMASHIN: Where is she? -Who? -That girl. -I didn't see any girl. -Give me the keys for everything. Closets. Store room. Everything. Keep an eye on him, Skeets. -Now, come on, talk. This is none of your business. Where is she, huh? Come on. Where is she? What do you want with her, anyway? Built pretty good. Nothing in her head but an alarm clock always going off. Bling, bling, she's nuts. What's this? -A dog. You going to shoot it? -Timashin? TIMASHIN: Yeah? -Any sign? TIMASHIN: Not yet. Now, come on. Why don't you talk? Give it up, huh? You've seen that Honey. You know what she is. A dumb kid, always playing games. Listen, did you ever-- did you ever, at Christmas, see a tree all lit up and pretty, all dressed up? Then after Christmas, fall in the gutter? Well, it's after Christmas for her. -Skeets. -Find her? -No. Now listen, mister. You're going to talk now. You're going to open up your mouth big and give me answers. -I don't have any answers. -You're going to answer me or I'll break every bone in your body one by one. Now talk! -You've got the gun, huh? You've got the meanest voice. Therefore I've got to talk, huh? What do you guys stand for that I should talk? [INAUDIBLE]. -Skeets! -Put the gun down, Skeets. Put it down! You're crazy if you think I won't shoot. -Now, baby, just relax. Take it easy. [GUNSHOT] -Come out. -Put down the gun. Put down the gun. HONEY: Come out! -I'll make a deal, Honey. I'll leave, and I'll just swear, I won't bother you. -Come out here. -I'll give you dough. You can use dough. You know how to spend it. -You've got the wrong girl. Honey Weber stayed with you and I'm going to get you both. Don't move! Maybe we'll stay here all night. Somebody'll come along. Maybe the man to fix the wires you broke. But you're going to get it all back. You and Skeets and Timashin. I don't want it anymore, lying in the dark like that. [CAR APPROACHING] [GUNSHOT] -There's the man! The one outside the door! -All right. See what's going on in there. -There's the other one! -All right, boys. Let's be nice and peaceful. MRS. BAILEY: Alan, Francis is waiting outside. ALAN: Francis? Francis! Where are you going? -I don't know. Just going. -I sort of-- sort of hoped you were looking for me. -Oh, Alan! Now Betty Furness wants you to guess where this girl is. BETTY FURNESS: Well, it looks like she's basking on a beach where the sun shines all winter long, doesn't it? But that's just a travel poster on the wall. And she's really right in her own living room getting a suntan with a Westinghouse sun lamp. Just a few minutes a day and you'll get are really good tan with the Westinghouse sun lamp. And just think, it costs only $8.50. And it's so wonderfully convenient to use anywhere in the house, especially since Westinghouse now offers you this convenient sun lamp holder. Now, with this handy holder, you can clamp your Westinghouse sun lamp-- well, let's see. To the headboard of your child's bed or to the bathroom mirror or [INAUDIBLE]. So many places all throughout the house. And it's only $0.35, and only Westinghouse brings you this convenient sun lamp holder. Now, to get yours, just send a sun lamp box carton top to Westinghouse, Box 431, Bloomfield, New Jersey. That's Westinghouse, Box 431, Bloomfield, New Jersey. Now, get a Westinghouse sun lamp from your dealer tomorrow, and don't forget to send for your convenient holder. And remember, you can be sure if it's Westinghouse. ANNOUNCER: This is Paul Branson saying goodnight for Westinghouse, who have made more than 40 million products for the American home. We hope you'll be with us again next week. Until then, goodnight.

Philip the Fair convoked the first Estates General. Agincourt? What year was the Battle of Agincourt? 1515. No... let's see... 1515's Marignan. So try a bit harder. Agincourt? Agincourt? 1415. Bravo! 1415. And who were we defeated by ? By our hereditary enemy. - Which one ? - The English. Exactly. Do you happen to know where Agincourt is ? In the department of Pas-de-Calais. The department is named after the strait which connects the English Channel to the North Sea. - You owe me 10 francs. - Good. Hurry up now. We're going to be late. - Papa ? - What ? The Battle of Poitiers... what year was it? What a question. What's that to you ? 1356. Why do you ask if you already know ? Already awake ? Good morning to you, too. You don't get enough sleep. You fret too much. Why that look ? Who's that. Of course it's not connected. - Here's your mail Yes, dear lady ? Not for 48 hours ? Ah, of course. Quite...yes. Take a marshmallow enema, and call me back this evening. Yes, you already told me that. Your ribbons are all crumpled. Tell Rose to give you some others. - Did you get good press ? - Not bad overall. This is an auspicious day: The Viscountess sent me a cheque ! Listen to this : "An iceberg...a field of ice, "that's the chill projected by Madeleine Vincent as Régine." It was over 38 degrees on stage... You know what critics are like... In "Combat", they said I played with fervour... - Do you find me that cold ? - Dopey ! Unhappy ? - Not because of that review ? - Don't be silly. I don't like that particular smile. - What about that smile ? - Dunno...an impression. - You're troubled ? - What an idea. - You lunching here ? - No. Everyone in Auteuil has flue. I'll have a cup of coffee at noon. - You ? - Same thing. I've a broadcast at 10, a fitting at 11.30 and I'm rehearsing the rest of the day. - Say something nice to me. - "Nice" ? - Doesn't matter what...quick ! - See you tonight. - Pierre ? - What ? - What day is it ? - Tuesday. - The date. - May 14th. Why ? Nothing. You and your questions ! Off you go ! Above all, make sure he doesn't catch a chill. You hear what the doctor said ? No more football stadium. He didn't say that. That's what he said. No more draughts. Attend to little Simonet right away. He's very tired. See you tomorrow...g'night. Hey...what do you want ? - I'm after Dr Vallon. - It's not his day on. It's for the concièrge at 1 Rue du Moulin-des-Clercs. A tenant just gassed himself. The concierge knows Dr Vallon. He's her doctor. - 1 Rue du Moulin-des-Clercs ? - It's 5 minutes away. Third right and second left. Go ahead, I'll meet you there. It's on the second floor. I'll show you. Hands off my bike ! Madame Nicolas, the doctor ! But it's not Dr Vallon. It's not his day on. Have you called the fire department ? - No. - You should've. I thought I was doing the right thing calling Dr Vallon. Stop smoking. You'll blow us all up ! Please move away from here. We're going, we're going. You heard...! This is no place for children. - Was he exposed for long ? - I can't say The 3rd-floor tenant alerted me. It smelled strong, when you came in ? The smell almost knocked me out. He should pull through... he's quite pink. - That's exactly what worries me. - Gosh ! - Is there a phone here ? - There. Fire brigade please. Rue du Moulin-des-Clercs. Number...? 1. Fire brigade ? Dr Pierre Richard calling. About a gassing suicide attempt. He's unconscious. Needs transport to Boucicaut. Rue du Moulin-des-Clercs. Number 1. 2nd floor. No, I won't budge. I'll wait for you. He'll go to hospital ? Does this boy have any family ? He's does have friends... but family... - What's his name ? - Daniel Prévost. - What's he do for a living ? - Painter. You see what sort ? I don't know where he got all this from. But he was very nice. - Is that his wife ? - No way...he's not married. It's a girl-friend. She's not a bad type for a woman like that. He was pretty much the baby of the building. When he had nothing to eat, I made him a stew. - She came to see him often ? - Can't say for sure. He was away for a long time. He had a year in the TB sanatorium. He's just come back. But he was just the same. I could see he knew he done for. That's why he wanted to kill himself. Poor girl. It'll hit her hard. It happened soon after she left. She was here today ? She arrived when my kid got home from school. - Had they been together for long ? - Oh, she's a faithful one. The first time I saw her, was during the Occupation. Truly ! Pick up a box of lobeline at the pharmacy. - Of what ? - Same as this. Applaudissements. Tonight, when you left me to join him at the opera, you were happy. I was happy because I'd decided to kill him during the night. I had no doubt that he'd die. I'd been watching him for a long time, this man who'd tried to dishonour me. I granted him a slight reprieve. I said I'd only kill him when he'd emptied his cup. I wanted to experience every pleasure from such a murder. Just for fun, I held his arm for a minute. He shrugged, not understanding. He drank. I have never been more lucid than that moment. I struck him twice in the heart one after the other. It was dreadful ! He was staggering, clinging to the furniture, with a terrified expression... But it was too late to feel any pity for him. You're here ? Régine... I'm no longer a woman one greeted at the opera. I've gone over to the other side. For better or for worse, Régine. We'll both leave, right away. By dawn we should be far from Paris. Whatever should happen, Arnaud, I'll have no regrets. Good evening, darling. It's gone better than yesterday. I think it'll work. We're doing our level best. You understood ? - If it's the police... - If it's the police, I surrender. No, stay there. - Are you waiting for me ? - I still have a call to make. Régine, it's Maxime. Good evening, Maxime. What a time to come visiting friends ! See you soon at home. I'm here to invite you to finish the evening with me. What a great idea ! I feel like dancing. I'm Dr Richard. I sent you a gassing victim. I'd like some news. He's been 2 hours on resuscitation. Now we just have to wait. You can see him, but he's weak. No, it's just to reassure his girl-friend, a married woman. I gave her a 50-50 prognosis... it might work out, but there's still danger. He thought he was condemned, so... - He hasn't spoken ? - No...no. - Incoherently. - Nothing compromising ? Anyway, if there is an investigation, I'll limit the damage. - Is there a jealous husband ? - One never knows. I'll give you my number, just in case. - You can call me. - Sure. Thanks a lot...'bye. - Is that you, Pierre? - Yes. Don't come in yet, wait a sec' . - Why ? - It's a surprise. That's for sure... - You were supposed to wait ! - What's it all about ? This ? Honestly ! ... This morning I asked you what day it was. You answered Tuesday. "The date?" You said May 14. Ungrateful ! So you've forgotten your French history ? 14th May 1942. Do you remember ? It was our own 14th of July. Here are fruits, flowers, leaves and branches. And here is my heart which beats only for you. It was 10 years ago tonight that we made love for the first time. As I'm an actress, I've learned our happiness by heart . They're nice lines. I won't recite them to you, they're too long, and my happiness seems to be annoying you. I love you, Pierre. That's all. And now, sit down and have dinner. But before you sit down, maybe could you kiss me? So that's the general missing from your collection. - I've got a present for you too. - I knew you would. That's nice. It was also missing from your collection. Pierre... Pierre... What ? You've got something to say ? There's nothing to say. You can see I'm quite calm and taking it well enough. I don't know yet what I'll do about us, but the....... what do you think about it ? What usually happens in cases like this ? There are those who kill and those who leave, those who kill themselves, and those who get drunk and then there are those who couldn't give a damn. I don't give a damn. Look, your daughter's on the roll of honour. So, I await the sordid details. To see to what extent you intend lying. After all, what do I know ? One photo proves nothing. You might be snapped with a childhood sweetheart. Thank goodness there was this photo. Otherwise there we'd be sitting... eating away like a pair of idiots. I had a lucky escape. Did he come to find you? Oh no...pure chance. Nothing but chance. By chance... his anniversary present. When I think... The things going through your head... You've got a whole range of lies to choose from in there. I don't intend to lie to you. So speak...! at least say something. No? Make yourself comfortable. This is really terrific. By day at her lover's, then by night they toast their 10-year old. You really pulled one on me. The moron who thought you were having a fitting at the theatre ! Funny sort of fitting ! I suppose you made him listen to your little recording. Look at me. Look me in the face, please ! Three days ago, you had the hide to say that in all the world you loved only me . Me...three days ago. You slut ! You're crying ? Who are you crying for ? For your little Mr Nobody ? Hullo...yes ! ? Very well, thanks. Yes, it went well. He's here, I'll put him on. It's Bernier. 'Evening, old boy. Yes... so ? He has a racking cough ? But he's not actually choking ? His breathing is very noisy ? It's stridulous laryngitis. I said he'd be like that tonight. Yes, she got your flowers, she thanks you. Sure. 'night, old boy. Can I talk to you ? So you've come up with an alibi? Hard, eh ? Is it because the story goes back a long time. Already under the Occupation, eh ? Where did you get to know him? At The Studio, the night of Anouilh's hundredth. "Anouilh's hundredth" ? You don't remember I played Circe at The Studio ? Sorry to have forgotten that historic event. And does this remind you of anything ? Oh, I'm so sorry. Ah yes, I do remember a rather sordid scenario. A woman I barely knew. - That you wanted to know better. - Don't change the subject. - I'm answering your question. You wanted to know where I met Daniel. I met him in '44, at The Studio, the night of Anouilh's hundredth. Because that night you'd humiliated me. So that's it... we've got it ! You deceived me and it's my fault. Excuse me. I would like to know why you were humiliated. You were horrible all evening. It was your party wasn't it ? For once we had the chance to forget the hassles of the Occupation. Everyone was having a good time together. But you pulled a face and went around sulking. No, I was exhausted. You didn't mind signing people's programs. I noticed that... -...over Madame Duranti's shoulder. Yes, because that night, I was jealous, you see. You danced out of step, as usual, but Madame Duranti ignored it. You looked silly in your vanity. A woman who only had top class lovers... You saw yourself there. A bed that men fought to enter... I didn't have any ulterior motive. No. Your desire was quite straightforward. Mony wasn't wrong there. - Is that the renowned Madame Duranti? - Yes, why ? Just wondering. - You know her ? - By reputation. You might find she has a weakness for doctors ? Jules, a glass of red. You two suddenly felt a great need for solitude. You took her by the arm and pulled her into the room. Then I had what I admit was a stupid crazy thought, I believed you two had left and disappeared into the night. Into the night, oh... You were sitting down. You only had eyes and ears for her. She talked and talked and you listened and laughed. I didn't exist anymore for you. You were truly alone in the world with Madame Duranti. And i said to myself : "He's laughing, he's happy. "If I tried to join their conversation, "his happiness would quickly evaporate." You didn't even hear me when I sat down behind you. And suddenly, all my unhappiness left me. Not sad, or worried, or tired. I studied that pretty back of Madame Duranti's. It was her laughing now. It was up to me to stop that laugh. Besides, it really felt great. One, two, two and a half... Pardon! What are you doing ? Are you mad ? - I'm going to pass out. I'm terribly sorry. Is there a first-aid kit here? Cigarette ? Just in case you need it. That's how I met Daniel. Then you arranged to meet ? Not quite. You mean it was fate that made you meet again ? He wanted to see the play again. I left him two seats. He came to thank me. - So then it was off to his place ? - A long time later. Oh yes...you struggled ! You endured a crisis of conscience over a brute who suspected nothing ! He'd hang around backstage. We used to chat. One day he brought me some records. - You hated them. - I'm no judge of music. Those were his records ? He dared me to come to his place. What'd I have to lose ? He wanted to test me. I almost turned back, and then I thought... "If I turn back it means I'm crazy about this boy. "What does he mean to me ? Not much. "He might be intimidated, but not me. "Who does he think he is ?" Here for some 'flagrante delicto' ? Come on in. I didn't want to come up but the concierge wasn't there. It doesn't matter, you're at home. - Your records. - Thank you. Just 5 minutes. Time to see your masterpieces. My masterpieces should be given more time. Marceline, we're finished. See you same time tomorrow. It's your portrait. She's only posing for the body. Your body remains unknown. i won't let you put my face on it. Why not ? She's got a nice body. Bummer ! I'm down to the cellar. I don't trust these alerts. - Nothing to be afraid of. - I'll wear your raincoat. Would you rather someone other than my Canadian? Where's the cellar ? Usually in the basement. I can't help it, I'm nervous. It's my liver. You can't leave now, you'll have to put up with me. Maybe it's a false alarm. You'll still be here three hours from now. It's written in the stars. I'll freshen up. - Do you fear death ? - No. But I hate it. You ? Oh, I'm crazy about it. - You can trust Death. - You're more worried about Life ? No. We know it has to end. I had a friend who really wanted to blow his brains out. Only he didn't have the means. So, as I'm a nice guy, I offered him a revolver and a wreath. At the last moment he chickened out. He sold the revolver to pay for a slap-up dinner. I don't like cheaters. In any case, he's dead to me. - And the wreath ? - There it is. I'm keeping it for my grandchildren. The gravediggers' melody. You're home. Come in, but don't break anything. This is Paris ! Don't touch the Folies-Bergère. Stop being stupid. Americans up in the sky... have pity on us Interpreter... An interpreter ! We need an interpreter. Explain to them that we're nice people, and they should spare the rooftops of Paris. Pray for us, black gods. Grant us a reprieve. Heed the voice of your masters ! Let's take advantage of a bad day. Bad days for some are good days for others. No thanks. I drink to love. You listening, the rest of you ? To love ! To my love, with a small 'L'. My love is very small, because love with a big 'L' is too easily found out. Madeleine, let me kiss you. Nobody will know... it's a camouflaged kiss. Madeleine, I swear on the back of Madame Duranti, that I love you. I'd regained my composure. Daniel amused me, no more than that. The act he'd put on had left me cold. I was sure he didn't love me. A bed, a woman and an alert... and he didn't try to take advantage ? I'm not defending myself. I'm explaining what happened. Don't push it, my lad. I'm not an easy woman I don't have a lover, and at the risk of you despising me, I love my husband. The sawbones ? - The sawbones. See what happens when you say outrageous things. That stab with the cigarette... it wasn't for spite, but for love. It was for love. - Your husband has a degree ? - Yes. - And a gong ? - That too. - And a good clientele ? - What are you getting at ? Upright citizen, model father, good tenant, a gentleman in every respect. How nice to have such a husband. A husband in polished walnut, guaranteed for life. Honour, family, country, duty, and boiled chicken. I'd give anything for a bomb to fall on this house. We could die together like Tristan and Isolde. Take that, King Mark ! Death for lovers is a fine beginning. It has to be the King Mark passive defense. He'd also like a medal for rescue ! Hey, I can see him now ! With his pickaxe and his little boots. And what does he find there under the rubble ? Love. Our two entwined bodies. You and I struck down, turned into statues. That'd fuck him, Tristan's Uncle Mark ! I'm talking to you. Are you listening ? I'm listening to your paintings. They show you the way you are. - How am I ? - No higher than this. You're about 6, like all the paintings. - That Apollinaire? - Yes. The only military man I like. "Under Mirabeau Bridge flows the Seine and our love "It must be remembered "Joy always came after the pain..." "Let night sound the hour The days go by, I remain "Hand in hand let us stay face to face "While under the bridge of our crossed arms, "eternal eyes of the wave so tired, "comes the night, sounds the hour. "The days go by but I remain." Try that some time with your husband. He lives in another world. You and I were one for just a moment...weren't we ? No. We've been alone together. It's not the same thing. - Why are you smiling ? - Nothing... because the alert's over. - "Over"? - It's over for me. For us both. Don't rush off, the Metro'll be jammed as usual. Do me a favour. In memory of this alert, take this as a souvenir. If anyone asks you what it is tell them it's a horse. Take it...off you go. Don't you dare? It's an evil painting ! Thank you. You're taking a part of me. I was eager to be near you, to hear your voice. Nothing happened. Bravo! Congratulations ! He offered you his bed and you didn't jump straight in. Such willpower ! What I have to listen to ! That's his picture ? You said you'd bought it from a Jew. And I believed it. A horse... look at it. It's as much like a horse as I'm an archbishop. And you were so proud. "The artist had managed to transcend the horse." "Transcend the horse"... I swore I'd never see him again. And you saw him again in a week. I saw him a year later, about Mony. - "Mony"? - Yes. When she had her accident Her miscarriage in rather obvious conditions. I have my opinions about Mony. - She was in an... - unavoidable situation. A husband who was to be freed, and find his wife in hospital. - You know she wasn't the only one. - That's not an excuse. If you'd seen her... I could have deceived him under normal circumstances, but these days it's impossible ! - What did the doctor say ? - That it runs its course. I've a fortnight left here, save for complications. I need some penicillin. Then I'll be up in three days. But it seems that's difficult. What there is reserved for major problems. I don't count. Silly little idiot. I'll have some penicillin for you within the hour. Please watch my bike. I'm Madame Richard. - Are you waiting for the doctor ? - Yes. He's next door. My boy's on the radio. Mademoiselle? I'm waiting for my husband Dr Richard. He won't be tied up long. You can sit down. - I watched your nurse. - So what? - That was Matron Fourcot. - No, no. It was that pretty Madame Meunier. - You're sure ? - Certain. - I guess it's possible. - She was more than pretty. A real stunner. But you know, when I'm working... At the time, certain details didn't register. Later, on reflection... Madame Meunier was an orderly woman. Yes, yes. And an overwhelming modesty. Excuse me. Go ahead. Apparently it's very good. The doctor lent it to me for my opinion. I was just being polite. I'm not accusing you of anything. Get dressed quickly, little man. What are you doing here ? Quite an event. You've met my colleague, Madame Meunier ? - I didn't say "colleague". - Yes you did. - I didn't mean it. - What brings you here? After...finish what you're doing. Establish the demand for care. There it is. I'd already prepared it. Good work. Righto my boy, we'll send you off on holiday. Three months at the sanatorium. It'll all be arranged. Goodbye doctor. Goodbye ladies. Say goodbye to the doctor. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, my boy. So now to you. Mademoiselle, could you leave us alone ? No, you stay there. Come in here. Your colleague had to be treated with kid gloves ! She wasn't my "colleague" ! Don't forget to note the date of the turnaround. It's already done. What's this about ? - I just left Mony. - How's she going ? She still has a fortnight, save for complications. Her husband's about to be repatriated. He'll be in for a big surprise. She said that with penicillin, she'd be on her feet in no time. Yes, with penicillin... Send in the next patient. So what's this about ? I've told you everything. Luckily we've got you. - You'll get her out of trouble. - Oh no, my pet don't count on me. - So who should I talk to ? - I don't care. Mony has a love-life that's just a bit too complicated. But, Pierre, I've promised her. You were wrong. She has her own doctor. If he has penicillin to spare, I see no problem. It's the first time I've ever asked you for something important. Important for whom ? Besides, she's not in any danger. Am I going to start handing out penicillin to unfaithful wives ? But she's my best friend. That doesn't absolve what she's done. You going now ? Pierre, be nice. I'm not here to be nice. This isn't a pharmacy here. I'm surprised that you could think that I'd go through with that. You obviously don't know me. - Suddenly you get all high and mighty. - I'm not high and mighty. I won't give penicillin to that slut ! And if she kills herself ? The suicide blackmail ? No and no again ! Doesn't work on me. So are you going or are you staying in here ? Oh well, as you wish. - What's his problem ? - Glands on his neck. Come and sit here, my man. - Been like this for long ? - 3 or 4 days. You'd never spoken to me so harshly before. You were right... I really didn't know you very well. I who'd loved you because of your indulgence to me ... - Here's a story about Mony. - Who told you about Mony? Much worse was that I couldn't count on you. So be it. I'd look elsewhere. But where ? The sale of penicillin was illegal. Who'd risk jail just to be nice ? I needed someone reliable. Let me see... "Someone reliable."... - It's funny all the same. - What is ? That you thought about me for such a thing. I haven't forgotten you. You had a chance, an opportunity, a cover story. This afternoon, I made a discovery. - I reviewed my friends... - In detail. I didn't find much reliability there. Many friends, few accomplices. You're the only one I can confide in. The others... No doubt you despise me a little, right? Would you like opium, cocaine? I also take care of currency smuggling. What are you getting at ? I have confidence in you, that's all. I have the face of an honest man ? Daniel, what are you doing ? - Do I have the face of an honest man ? - No ! Was that all because I said you gave me confidence. Where there's confidence, there's respect. But I don't want your respect. It's a degrading sentiment. Keep it for your easy friends. All I want is your love. There's no rush. If one day you find the need to love and be loved, do as you've done for the penicillin, and 'phone me. How's my horse ? How's my horse going ? He's not kicking his frame too much ? He's never doubted that he was a horse. Maybe he thinks he's something else. I'd pass for some shady character who sells some penicillin. Madeleine, look at me. Look at me. I'm going to kiss on the mouth, long and hard. No, it's not over. I said 'long and hard'. Thank you for that silence. All very touching. I'm not kissing you, but I'm telling you that I'm kissing you What a generation ! I'm trying to explain exactly what happened. I still didn't know that you'd love him. I didn't realize that I did. He didn't delay giving you his news, after that unforgettable encounter ? He promised to spend next day at the theatre. I was doing a repeat of Romeo and Juliet. I wasn't with it in what I was doing. "Death is less strong than my love, Juliet. "By this blessed moon..." "Death is less strong than my love, Juliet ! "By this blessed moon..." -Hey, Madeleine ! - Sorry ? - You're on. - But yes, dear friend. Would you rather skip this scene? Would you like someone to get you a coffee ? I'm not tired, I'm just a bit distracted. I'll pay attention. Give me the line again. It's nothing, I assure you. "Death is less strong than my love, Juliet." Who's that down there ? Ah, it's for me. Just a moment. Please just give me a moment. Have you got what you promised ? I've been to the market. I've brought your order. Here's the coconut. - How much do I owe you ? - Don't be rude. Thank you, Daniel. You're wonderful. I'll never forget this... It's what you have done for me. Most appreciated. Daniel ! - Can we get on with it ? - Yes, of course. So do we go back or keep going ? Keep going. I only wanted one thing... to rush off to Mony. And see Daniel again. - It's not so simple. - What ? - You didn't go to his place that day ? - No. Where are you going ? - Daniel's. - He doesn't get home before midnight - 2 am. So late ? Yes. Especially since he's been doing his number. "His number"? Painting doesn't feed him. He's got an act at the 'Zero for Conduct', A nightclub that's just opened. You wanna leave him a message ? No. You said the 'Zero for Conduct' ? That's good for him, eh ? That's where you'll find him. It starts about 9. You have to understand that his name's Jules. He created Caesar, Pompey and Pagnol. Jules, like the other one, would rather be first in Paris than second in Marseilles. Besides, he's from Toulon. - Mademoiselle Vincent ? Please come through. Maybe not right now. Just a little uninteresting act. You must hear our feature artist, Barbara. She's terrific. I discovered her. She was punching tickets on the Metro. A bit of luck... I never take the Metro. Just need to put a name to the face. Jules to his close friends and he only has close friends. Give him the applause he deserves. Hold on, I'm not finished Mesdames messieurs, Just the once won't hurt, at last we have a quality member of the audience here tonight. She's listening to me, standing there, with total deference. Spotlight...aim...there You all of course recognize Madeleine Vincent, the moving, the stirring, the enigmatic, the mysterious. the irregular Madeleine Vincent. Don't clap ! Don't clap ! She's not here for you. She's here for me. Ignore him... And I'll have the pleasure of working for my pleasure. This is a very dangerous exercise. The drawing of death, without a safety net. Attention, I'm starting. The stream that follows your course, and flows out of you. Nice eh ? The stream... It has nothing to do with it, but it's nice anyway. And there's the work. Work fast, mourn next day, all done by the student of master Photomaton. Let me introduce... Teddy Kortman, the boss. We going ? Mademoiselle, let me introduce myself : Taboureau, a big fan. Make my day and take a drink at my table. But on what grounds ? She doesn't know you and you want her to make your day ? In 20 minutes you'll be asking for her blouse ! - You're pretty aggressive ? - I can stay 5 minutes. And if they were the last ? You're not funny this evening. Some champagne 'll do you good. I don't insist, but I expect you at my table. - You're going a bit far. - I don't drink with just anybody. Taboureau is a fine fellow and a good customer. You have to hear Barbara. You're only interested in selling your booze. Nonsense! The bottle's on me. Albert, a Mumms '37 to table 21. Mademoiselle Vincent doesn't want to appear with your black-market kings. Now, out of interest, take a look at your customers' snouts. You know what you have to do. I certainly do, thank you. Madeleine ? - Are you angry ? - I don't like your character. What "character"? The one that you seem obliged to play. I came to see you. I'm not impressed by your tomfoolery. You can't leave like this. Daniel, I order you to conduct Madame to my table. - You can stop bugging us. - Tut, tut nobody ever talks to Toto in that tone of voice, ever. You must talk to him like yesterday when you needed him, with consideration and respect. The penicillin, eh, who got it for you ? - Are you gonna shut up ? You were quite happy to find it through Toto. Little bastard ! Why had I spoken so harshly to him ? "His character"... He at least had the courage of his convictions. What did he pay for the penicillin with ? You didn't even ask him. It was of no interest to you. Who had he stolen from ? Would you ever steal for me ? I once did the wrong thing at a soup sellers. - Were you remorseful ? - Maybe. And if you meet me again, avoid me. That's my advice to you. You like this character ? - What happened to you ? - A bottle of champagne. I didn't like how your name sat on certain peoples' lips, so there was a bit of fisticuffs. You can't stay like this. It's not too obvious ? Observe that the champagne didn't hurt anyone. - Who hit you ? - I didn't notice. But it was a good bottle. It was a '37. Apparently it was a good year. - Where are you taking me ? - Where do you want me to take you ? - 1 Rue du Moulin-des-Clercs. - Hey, don't mess up my seat-covers. - Get undressed. - Me get undressed ? Yes, undo your belt. Lift your legs. If you're trying to make up to me... What a memory. - Is that all I take off ? - You'll have to manage that yourself. Drink that. If only I'd known, I'd 've got wounded more often. - Tilt your head toward me. - With pleasure. - That hurt ? - No it's The Prime Minister's on the phone. Tell him I'll call him back, would you? You know, Rimmer. This survey of yours isn't going to make it any easier for me at the party conference. There have been some rumblings, you know. I suppose if we only publish the more... positive aspects of your leadership, it might, er... (HUTCHISON) Ah, yes, well, hmm... Have you ever thought of going into politics, Michael? We need some dynamic young blood in the party. (RIMMER) But are there any seats available? (HUTCHISON) Oh, yes. There are always seats available to the right man. Old Eric Bentley's thinking of retiring. (RIMMER) Well, I would be very interested. (HUTCHISON) Of course, it depends on what happens at the conference. (RIMMER) I think I can help you there, Tom. - Really? (FAIRBURN) (LOUDLY) No, no, Ferret! *That* one! (HUTCHISON) (DECLAIMING) "And the first priority" "must be that of trades union reform..." (RIMMER) (HECKLING) What about unemployment? (HUTCHISON) "Don't talk to me about unemployment!" (RIMMER) Very good. Keep the turn, that was beautiful. Now if we could just try it once again. (HUTCHISON) "Don't talk to me about unemployment, young man." "I was... unemployed before you were born." "My memory of those terrible days in the Thirties" "still brings tears to my eyes." (NISS) Now. Cry now. (RIMMER) Don't worry, Tom. We'll supply your tears. (HUTCHISON) Oh, thank you! (RIMMER) Right – next heckle. (HE SINGS 'THE RED FLAG') "The people's flag is deepest red..." (NISS) "It shrouded oft our martyred dead..." (HUTCHISON) "Thank you for your charming rendition" "but I do not think the group" "is ready to record yet." (RIMMER AND NISS APPLAUD) Lose the smile, love. (RIMMER) Right, applause, applause. (FOOTBALL RATTLES TURN – RIMMER AND NISS CHEER) - Hurray! - Bravo! - Wonderful! - Well done, Tom! (RIMMER) Well done, Tom! (NISS) What a ham. (RIMMER) Tom, that was absolutely terrific! (NISS) Fantastic warmth! (RIMMER) So natural this time... (NISS) You've done it again! (RIMMER) Keep expecting the students – everything's going to be all right on the night! (VIOLENT CROWD NOISES) (STUDENTS CHANTING) Police violence! Police violence! (CHANTING) Shame! Shame! (CHANTING) Fascist pigs! Fascist pigs! (NISS) And how did you persuade the authorities to establish a Faculty of Applied Violence? (RANJIT X) Direct action. It's the only way, with the minimum of non-violence. U.S., plus napalm, equals – what? (STUDENT) Fascism, Ranjit. (RANJIT X) First class, Gary. Now, as I understand, you guarantee maximum TV and press coverage, travel expenses, and a bonus for speaking parts. (NISS) Plus your usual personal appearance fee of... (RANJIT X) Oh, don't let's go into bourgeois things like money. Speak to my agent about it. Get up! None of that old Gandhi rubbish! Get up and hit someone! Oh, Che. Forgive them, for they know not what they do. Would you all come over here, please? Will the group singing 'We Shall Not Be Moved' move over here, please? Fellow students. Next week, the Conservative Party is holding its annual conference... (APPLAUSE) (CHAIRMAN RAPS GAVEL) (RIMMER) Hold on to the handkerchief, Tom, and no smiling. Ladies and gentlemen. The next Prime Minister of Great Britain, and leader of the Conservative Party... Tom Hutchison! (PROLONGED APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) Ladies and gentlemen. (STUDENTS SING) "The people's flag is deepest red..." "It shrouded oft our martyred dead..." (CHAIRMAN) Order! Order! Throw them out! Throw them out! (RANJIT X) Leave me alone! Leave me alone... Down with the fascist pigs! (SINGS) "The people's flag is deepest red..." (VOICE IN CROWD) Throw them out! (HUTCHISON) No, no! No, no – I would ask the ushers not to eject our friends of the left. (UPROAR DIES DOWN) The Conservative Party believes in freedom of speech. (APPLAUSE AND CHEERS) And I only wish they did! (MORE APPLAUSE) Thank you for that charming rendition but I don't think the group of vocalists of the left are ready to record yet! (APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER) (NISS) It's going very well. (HUTCHISON) And now, if I may turn to economic matters... (WOMAN IN AUDIENCE) What about the Old Age Pension? (RIMMER) That's not in the script... (WOMAN) What about the Old Age Pension? (HUTCHISON) Don't talk to me about unemployment, young man! I was unemployed before you were born. My memory of those terrible days in the Thirties still brings tears to my eyes. And I, and the whole of the Conservative Party are strongly committed... (CAPSULE HISSES) and I emphasise this... (BANGS ON LECTERN) We are committed to a policy of full employment... (SOBS) lower taxation... social justice... (UNCONTROLLABLE SOBBING) and... and... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry... (ENTHUSIASTIC APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) Amidst amazing scenes at the Conservative Party conference this afternoon the Leader of the Opposition was accorded an unprecedented seven minutes ovation. Mr Hutchison. Your position as leader must now be completely secure. How do you feel about the violent heckling that punctuated your speech? I am not saying that the Labour Party was responsible for this disgraceful episode. But I will say this – it did seem to be organised. (PHOTOGRAPHERS) One more, sir! - Look this way, sir! (HUTCHISON) Michael! Niss! (RIMMER) Well done, Tom! Very good indeed. (HUTCHISON) What's the next move then, Michael? (RIMMER) At the moment, Tom, I've got my personal life to consider. - I'm thinking of getting married. - Oh, congratulations, Michael. - I think an MP needs a wife by his side. - Quite right. (NISS) Who is it? That... I'm not entirely sure of. Have you got the result of that poll yet? Yes. Queen, number one, as usual. She's out. Oh, yes. Number two. Second most popular girl in Britain – Pat Cartwright, showjumper. - Very nice. - Love at first sight? - Pretty girl, isn't she? - You romantic fool, you! (# ROMANTIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (CLICKING OF TYPEWRITER KEYS) (RIMMER) Morning. Hello. (# ROMANTIC MUSIC CONTINUES) (SMALL TALK IS IN BACKGROUND) (PAT) Would you like to have a drink? My parents would love to meet you. I'd love to, the trouble is I've got to dash and see the Prime Minister. (PAT) Oh. - How about dinner some time? (# 'RIMMER' THEME) (BLACKET) Hello Michael. Nice of you to come. My privilege, Prime Minister. - Make yourself comfortable. - Thank you. Tell me, Michael. Have you ever thought about going into politics? We're always on the lookout for fresh blood and there are one or two seats available. Well, I've never really thought of myself as a socialist. Can't see why that should be an impediment. We're not bound by dogma. Think it over. The offer's there. Thank you. Now then, my spies tell me – not literally, of course! (PRESSES RECORD) ...that your firm has been investigating the reasons for the slight decline in the popularity of my government. I'm afraid it's you, sir. But your polls have always shown me as being more popular than the government as a whole. Exactly. The public haven't been seeing enough of you. I mean, you haven't been on our TV screens for quite a while now. Well, I try to give the impression that we work as a team. But every team needs a leader. True. So you think a little more exposure on the silvery tube? The more the better! (BLACKET LAUGHS QUIETLY) (PRIME MINISTER, ON RADIO) Good evening, and hello again. A lot has happened since ten o'clock this morning, so I thought it was about time we had another of our little fireside chats... (RIMMER) Never seen a man dig his own grave before. (PAT) Go turn him off, Michael. (CHANNEL CHANGES TO 'LOUNGE' MUSIC STATION) (RIMMER) I must tell you how much I've always admired your seat. It's been an inspiration to me over the years. (HE KISSES PAT) (RIMMER) With this ring... Stop it. We mustn't... Once doesn't count as breaking training. I've got the Olympic Heats tomorrow I've got the 'olympic heats' tonight. (DREAMILY) I think I've achieved a new personal best! (TV COMMENTATOR) The surprise upset at the White City was the defeat of Pat Cartwright who failed to complete her round. (SOUND OF SPLASH AT WATER JUMP) She complained afterwards of stomach cramps. (INTERFERENCE) ... We see her now coming out on Brown Goblin. She's safely over the first – riding slightly higher in the saddle than usual – a quick turn here... (FERRET SWITCHES SET OFF) (MRS FERRET) Where's it all gone? (FERRET) Huh? Where's all what gone? - The furniture. - Ah. Well, while you were out this morning it started getting a bit shaky. So I just popped it into the furniture shop to have it re-pawned... repaired. I rather like it like this. A great feeling of space. Care for a glass of 'Fors'? (BLACKET) Good morning! (GUARD) Nice to see you again so soon, sir. - You know the way, I imagine? - Oh, yes. We thought of building you a flat up there, sir. Oh, no, no. Very amusing! Because I'm here so often, you mean? (LAUGHS) Bloody Capricorns! I'll have a word with Bob about him. A little regional unemployment, I think. (LAUGHS LOUDLY) (# PASTORAL FLUTE AND HARPSICHORD MUSIC) (HUTCHISON) Oh, Michael. Let me introduce my old friend Teddy Mandeville. The next Chancellor of the Exchequer, eh, Teddy? (RIMMER) Very nice to meet you in the flesh, sir. (MANDEVILLE) It's a pleasure. (SPOT) Hello. (HUTCHISON) I must say that Blacket idea's working out awfully well. (SPOT) Even our gardener's sick of him. I mean, he's never off the box! (RIMMER) I hope he doesn't die of over-exposure. (LAUGHTER) Such a ghastly little man! (RIMMER) He is a big help. You know what's going to decide the election? Law and order. That, and the race issue. I think we should be tougher with the immigrants. Well, I don't see how we can be any tougher than the Labour Party. We can't let in less than zero. (SPOT) We could let a few out. I mean, Uncle Eric's got this super idea about a boat race. Five thousand pounds for the first West Indian who can row back to Jamaica. When they all sort of row off, it'll be fantastic! - I mean... (SPOT'S AUNT) Spot. Your shot. Oh, my shot... Coming, Auntie Vanya! (RIMMER) As Sir Eric is retiring in any case why don't you allow him to express his real views? (HUTCHISON) The man's a lunatic! Good shot, Eric! (RIMMER) Exactly. He could make a grossly inflammatory speech – you could sack him and emerge as a man of principle, yet the impression would still get about that we are tougher on immigration than the Socialists. (RIMMER) Peter, I wonder if I could tear you away from my fiancée for a moment? Like you to call up a few newspapers... Nobody could accuse me of being a racialist... (SPOT LAUGHS) ...but when I hear stories as well-authenticated as this which I heard from a very close friend of a constituent who had been talking to somebody in a pub who had heard from an extremely reliable source that a fragile old lady of ninety-two had been locked in a lavatory by a group of ten immigrants who proceeded to poke at her with sharpened broomsticks for a period of fourteen hours whilst they chanted anti-white slogans, and finally forced her to use a newspaper photograph of Mr Enoch Powell in a way... that I'd rather not go into here. When I hear stories like that, I wonder – are we mad, to allow, in this country, fragile old ladies to be ruthlessly poked by blacks!

Are we mad? Are we? Have you read this filth? (INDIFFERENTLY) Yes, I have. Dreadful, quite dreadful. Dearie me. Oh, dear. What are you going to do? I can't be Home Secretary in a party that condones racialism. Don't you worry, Hugh. I will act – I will act. In fact, on matters of principle I am acting the whole time. Sir Eric is announcing his resignation this evening. Yes, Michael's taking his seat at the General Election. But that still gives the impression we're a lot of racialists! I admire your integrity, Hugh but you must realise we must win this election. (# HUTCHISON BEGINS TO PLAY LIGHT PIANO PIECE) And let's face it – this won't do us any harm at all. No harm. At all. It's no good. I must speak out! You see, Hugh – I don't think Tom wants another five years in opposition. I don't care. I won't be muzzled! (PIANO CONTINUES) Hello, whitey! Good evening.

Just, erm, a few drops in the eyes to get the merry twinkle going! (LAUGHS) And, er, could you make the mouth more generous? (NISS) Keeping fit? (PAT) That's about all there is for me to do around here. (NISS) Yes, I used to be pretty fit when I was in the army. The only trouble was, it made me so incredibly ...randy. (PAT) Yes. It does. Incredibly randy. Yes, you must be... pretty fit. How's married life suiting you? How should I know? I've hardly seen him since the ceremony. What about all those lovely pictures of you together in the papers? That's about the only time we've been together – when there's a photographer around. (NISS) Yes. Yes, I must admit there is a calculating side to Michael that I find very... disturbing. But do you actually know anything about him? I mean, where does he come from? Never talks to me about it. Just tells me that he was found in the bulrushes. (PAT) You can't stand him, can you? No. Er, no, no, no – nothing like that. I just don't like to see what he's doing to you. What he's *not* doing to me... (COUNTRY SOUNDS) Good evening! Before you vote next week I'd like you to remember that basically, you know, friends, this election isn't about money and material things – it's about morality. The Labour Party's nothing if it is not a moral crusade. It's hardly necessary for me to remind you what we stand for. The Labour Party stands for... (AUTOCUE CLICKS INEFFECTUALLY) well, er, it stands for, er... (AUTOCUE IS SWITCHED OFF AND ON) well, it stands for... we stand for, er... (SHOUTS) Look! I'm not standing for any more of this!

Stop the machine! Is there nobody in control here? (HUTCHISON) I must say, Michael, you did an excellent job with Blacket. I hope I can continue to do well, sir. (HUTCHISON) I've been thinking about the composition of the Government... (HE GASPS AT THE COLDNESS OF THE WATER) ...and I was trying to work out where your many talents would bear most fruit. Well, as all my experience has been in financial matters I thought Chancellor of the Exchequer. (HUTCHISON) Oh, my dear Michael. You're not even an MP yet! (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I must say I admire your directness and drive but you must see that Mandeville must be in charge of the Exchequer. Of course, I've always believed that a man's personal life is his own affair. What do you mean? You haven't heard anything, then? No. What is there to hear? Well, I hate to spread gossip, and they're probably faked, in any case. What are faked? The photographs I was sent. Of Mandeville? ...And friends. But even if they're real, I don't see why they should affect his efficiency at the Exchequer. Do you have these, erm, photographs with you? Yes, I thought it better to hand them over to you and say no more about it. God knows where the negatives are. That's not Mandeville. The other way up, sir. Good God! The continental pig! Good heavens! Tut, tut! Keister! God... I may have to reconsider. (NEWSPAPER SELLER SHOUTS RAUCOUSLY) "Conservative Shadow Chancellor resigns" "without giving his reason. Surprise appointment" "of Tory whizzkid, Michael Rimmer!" The next Conservative Government will reduce Income Tax, reduce Purchase Tax and increase Old Age Pensions. This I solemnly pledge.

I mean, it isn't connected to anything. Oh yes it is. Goodnight, Peter. (# CURRENT AFFAIRS THEME) Good evening and welcome to Election Grandstand. The first result should be coming in quite soon from Clitheroe. This is Hugh Wilting's seat and traditionally the first constituency to complete the counting. But first, with no results in, let's ask Peter Niss of Fairburn Polls, what he thinks of the situation. Well frankly, Steven, I think we've started the programme about an hour too early... (HENCH LAUGHS) Well, let's go over to Freddie Daring at Clitheroe, to see if there's any news yet. Well, these lads have a great reputation to maintain and they're absolutely determined to give us the first result! I've never seen such fast, hard counting, and I think we should have something to tell you in a few minutes. Well, thank you Freddie. And now let's take one more look at the state of the parties. Well, that's the position at the moment with no results in yet, and now perhaps we can get a reaction from New York. So over there now, by Early Bird, to Tom Stoddart. I am not your buddy. Neither am I your mother! Appalling people! Ah, yes, well – over here in New York we are all, as they say over here, 'dog-gone keen' to hear the first result... (HENCH) ... And so are we here in London. And we must go back up to Clitheroe as I think they may have something for us. Come in, Freddie. (HENCH) Freddie? Can you hear me? In that case, back to New York! Here in Stockholm, we are extremely excited... (HENCH) We don't want to talk to you at the moment, Doctor Luns – if we could talk to you later. We're going back to Clitheroe to get the first result. - Oh, but I want... (HENCH) Thank you, Doctor Luns, we'll come back to you in a moment. So over to Freddie Daring in Clitheroe for the first result! (HENCH) Hello, Freddie? - Hello, Freddie? (TOM STODDART) Over here in New York... (HENCH) Hello, Freddie? If we could just get Freddie... No, we don't have the result yet, but in the closing minutes these lads are going really berserk. George Winthrop, one of the most experienced counters, broke a finger just now – but he's carrying on. (DR LUNS) Hello, London! (HENCH) Well, thank you, Freddie. Well, still no results from Clitheroe. Peter Niss? In that case, let's rejoin our good friend Doctor Luns in Stockholm. Are you there, Doctor Luns? He has gone to the... He will be back. In that case, let's go over to Paris where Pierre Dubois is waiting. Bonsoir, Pierre! (WAITER) Bonsoir! (HENCH) Pierre Dubois, both candidates at Clitheroe are keen supporters of the Common Market. What's the French reaction to this phenomenon? Ecoutez, Monsieur. Je ne comprends rien et je m'en fou! Salut! Le service non compris. Comme d'habitude d'ailleurs! ...Well, I don't think we've located the right Pierre Dubois. But while we were talking to Paris we did get the first result – not from Clitheroe but from Beccles – and here it is. A Conservative gain of 17,000. Now let's see what swing that is. Over to Magnus Orbison on the swingometer. (HENCH) Peter Niss... Well, that's just under a twenty percent swing to the Conservatives. It's exactly what we predicted at Fairburn. If it's repeated it'll give the Conservatives an overall majority of, what, 265? Ah. Well now the results are coming in thick and fast. And here's an interesting result. Michael Rimmer has held Budleigh Moor for the Conservatives with a greatly increased majority. (# MAIN 'RIMMER' THEME) (MRS FERRET) He's in. I knew he'd do it! (FERRET) But only by 17,000. (HENCH) That's another Conservative gain. And so, with 435 results in, we have the news that the Prime Minister has conceded defeat. (TV EXPLODES) And now it's six-fifteen in the morning, there's only the Clitheroe result to come in. And here it is. After three recounts Hugh Wilting has retained his seat with a majority of only five. That's over 18,000 down from the last election, due no doubt to his courageous stand on the race issue. So now we leave Election Grandstand with a new Conservative Government in office. And it's thanks to all our experts, and good night. (FLOOR MANAGER) Right, that's it, studio. Wrap it up. (# CURRENT AFFAIRS THEME) (MUSIC ENDS) (ON MONITOR) Luns, here. Doctor Luns. Er, hello. Hello, London... This is Stockholm... (NEWSREADER) The Prime Minister is holding an emergency Cabinet meeting at Chequers to discuss what he describes as the very grave financial situation... (GENIAL CONVERSATION AND LAUGHTER) Gentlemen. The Chancellor is bringing the exact figures but I do feel that unless we announce strong measures there is a grave danger of another run on the Pound. I wonder if you would excuse me a moment? I have a rather important call to make to my wife in Zurich... Gentlemen. I must ask you as patriots and ministers not to speculate against the Pound. (HUTCHISON) Michael. There you are! Sorry to keep you, Tom. I wanted to have all the figures. (HUTCHISON) Good. We've just been discussing the appalling mess we've been left by the Socialists. (HUTCHISON) We have inherited a mess, haven't we? - Oh yes, yes. Yes, we have. - Good, fine! In fact, overall, the financial situation could be described as disastrous. - Catastrophic! - 'Hopeless' is another good one. I think we're all agreed on the nature of the problem. Now, Michael. What are your proposals for dealing with this, er... crisis. Well, first of all I'd reduce Income Tax, reduce Purchase Tax, and increase the Old Age Pensions. You must be mad! Well, I think we ought to honour our pre-election pledges. (HUTCHISON) No, no, Michael. - Nobody expects that of us. - Hear, hear! No, the normal routine is to say that we are all staggered and horrified and then blame it all on the last lot! I mean, what are our gold reserves at the moment? - Two-and-a-half million. - God Almighty! No, seriously, Michael. What are your proposals? Well, I've been having a word with our friends in Paris and Bonn. I didn't know we had any friends in Paris and Bonn. And I think that while I'm sort of, sorting things out it would be best to sit back and do nothing for a couple of weeks. Good idea! Will all those in favour of sitting tight and doing nothing for two weeks, raise one arm? (LAUGHTER) (HUTCHISON) Carried unanimously! Thank you, gentlemen. That's all I want to say to you. - Goodbye, Prime Minister. - 'Bye, Michael. Oh, and I do think we should try and create the impression of some activity. What about a summit? That would pass the time. Very good indeed. And talk about things in terms of keeping our options open. (HUTCHISON) Right. (CHAIRMAN) Jolly good idea. Very good idea. No comment, gentlemen.

(SOLEMN TYMPANI NOTES) Tonight, the country lies stunned by the tragic news of the death of the Prime Minister. (BLACKET DISGUISES INVOLUNTARY LAUGHTER BY COUGHING) Messages of sympathy have been pouring in from all over the world. The Pope has condemned the senseless violence of our times. The President of the USA has spoken warmly of the man with whom he recently spent so much time. Here in the studio tonight we have three men who knew him well. First, the Home Secretary, Hugh Wilting, who was with him when he died. This is a black day... er, darkish sort of day for Britain. (HENCH) Your Grace... I think it ironic that a man who so loved the sea should be, so to speak, bitten by the mouth that drowned him. Was it St Paul, or Cole Porter who said we always hurt the one who loves us? But I'm sure this fine man has found solace in Heaven with Almighty God – if there is such a person. Mr Blacket. You, at times, have been on rather acrimonious terms with the late Prime Minister. We've had our differences. On one occasion – indeed, on several occasions – you described him as a 'two-faced, weasel-eyed git'. In the rough-and-tumble of parliamentary debate one often says things that are easily misinterpreted. But there was a great warmth between us. One hates to make, er, party points, but, erm Suffer little ones and let the little ones suffer. He giveth and taketh away, and casts his bread upon the waters. Well, let's take one more look at the tragic accident, this time in slow motion. (FILM ON SCREEN HAS NO SOUND) (HENCH) Here, we see the Prime Minister moving to one side to give the photographers a better view of the gold. This is the crucial moment. The Prime Minister slips.

I might be a bit late. - I want a divorce. - Divorce? Why? To put it in the only terms you'd understand... sexually speaking we're seventy percent below the national average. I shouldn't pay too much attention to one month's figures. Seasonal variations can be very misleading. I mean it, Michael. I want a divorce. That's normal. About forty-two percent of married women go through this phase during the first year of their marriage.

I sentence you both to six million years in prison. (Gavel Bangs) Shrift: Come along. I'll take you to the dungeon. Milo: But- but you can't. I mean- only a jailer can put you in prison. Shrift: Good point. (Magic Music). I am also the jailer. Come on, come on! Humbug: Keep your chin up, my boy. Maybe they'll take a million years off for good behavior. Bee: Be the "e" of good hope. H-O-P-E. (Somber Marching Music) Shrift: You'll find it quite pleasant down here. Milo: Isn't it a little dark? Shrift: Of course it's dark. Dungeons are always dark. If they weren't dark, they wouldn't be so unpleasant. Milo: But you said it would be pleasant down here. Which- Shrift: Precisely. Which (*Witch). You can always chat with a Which if you get lonely. Shrift: This is it, all the comforts of home. (Door Creaks/Slams) See you in six million years! Frightening Music Plays Which: Oh, there you are! How do you do? Milo: (hesistates) Hello. Which: Come in, come in, come in. Milo: You'd better be very careful, m'am. There's a witch around here somewhere. Which: Well, of course there is! I am she. Faintly Macabre, the not-so-wicked Which. There, you see? Official Which: Kingdom of Wisdom. Milo: Oh, a Which! Like the Whether Man. Which: Of course! The Whether Man is my brother. At least he used to be. I don't know whether he still is, I haven't seen him in years! Have a cookie. The question marks are delicious! Milo: What does a Which do? Which: Well, I used to help people choose which words to use- Which were the most proper and fitting words for any and all occasions. But when Rhyme and Reason were banished- Milo: Rhyme? And Reason? Which: Yes, Milo. When the two kings had their terrible quarrel- (Adventerous Music Begins) Which: When King Azaz insisted that words were far more important than numbers, and hence his kingdom was truly the greater, and when Mathemagician claimed that numbers were much more important than words, and therefore his kingdom was supreme, why then naturally, they asked the Princess of Sweet Rhyme, and the Princess of Pure Reason to settle the question. Milo: And what did they decide? What is the most important? Words or numbers? Which: The princesses decided that words and numbers are of equal value. Tock: In the cloak of knowledge, one is the warp and the other in the woof. Which: But you see Milo, this decision infuriated the two kings, and they banished the princesses to the Castle in the Air. (Dramatic Music Plays) And I was thrown into this dungeon. Tock: And that's why people don't seem to care anymore which words they use, as long as they use lots of 'em. Milo: And that's why there's no rhyme or reason around here, and everybody thinks he's so good! Hey! Maybe we can rescue them, and rescue you too Mrs. Faintly...in about six million years. Soldier L: Ah, there you are. Soldier M: Where have you been? Soldier N: Been looking all over for you. Soldier O: Royal banquet is about to begin. Soldier P: Soup's on. Milo: I still have to serve my sentence of six million years in prison. Soldier L: No time for sentences. Soldier M: No time for words. Soldier N: Condemn boy to hearty meal. Soldier O: Prisons are for the birds. Soldier P: Jailbirds. Soldier L: Mustn't keep Azaz waiting. Soldier M: Things get hungry, too. Soldier N: Royal banquet's just beginning. Soldier O: Just in time for royal stew. Soldier P: Chow (Ciao). Milo: Goodbye Mrs. Macabre, don't worry. I'll find a way to rescue you. (Cheerful Music) Tock: Bye, Faintly. We'll be back. (Glittery Tones Play As Which's Tears Fall) (Royal Trumpets Sound) Soldier: His Majesty, the Supreme Ruler of Semantics, Most Eminent Chieftain of Participles, Lord and Master of Words, Super Sovereign of Syntax, Chief Potentate of Adverbs and Prepositions. (Soldier P Whizzing to Grab Chair) King Azaz the Unabridged. Milo: If you please, sir. (Azaz Bristles At "Sir") Milo: Your majesty. My name is Milo, and this is Tock, my watchdog. And we've been sentenced to six million years for- Azaz: Ahhh! Six million? That's not a sentence, that's a number. It's against the law to mention numbers here in Dictionopolis. Words are the only things that matter. Milo: I'm sorry your kingship, sir. Azaz: After all, me boy- (Singing) You couldn't have one fine day without the "day," could you? You couldn't have tea for two without the "tea," could you? You couldn't have three blind mice, without the "mice," could you? So you see, Milo, words are really, very valuable things. If you think a great thought, how do you write it down? Words! If you spot a brush fire, how do you warn the town? Words! If you have opinions, how do you speak your piece? If you rent a castle, how do you read your lease? If you know a good joke, how do you tell a friend? Words, words! That's how. Words in a word are amazing. You can read 'em, you can write 'em, you can sing 'em, and recite 'em, underline them. Misdefine them. They're amazing! Words in a word are fantastic! You can hint 'em, you can say 'em, you can print 'em, you can pray 'em. Emphasize them and despise them. They're fantastic! String them into sentences and thoughts profound. We'll abound, in a symphony of spoken sound, truth is found, beauty crowned. In other words, words in a word are delicious! You can taste 'em, you can treat 'em, you can waste 'em, you can 'eat em. And digest them, I suggest them! They're delicious! (King Sighs) Words. (Music Ends Dramatically) Azaz: Speechers, speechers. Time for speeches. You my boy, as our guest, may speak first. Milo (clears throat): Your Majesty, uh Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity- Azaz (claps): Enough, next. Tock: Soup bones, dog biscuits, porter house steak, carpet slippers. Humbug: Roast turkey, mashed potatoes, vanilla ice cream. Soldier L: Veal Cutlet Parmesan. Soldier M: Eggplant Florentine. Soldier N: Eggs goldenrod. Soldier O: Jones sausage, "reosh." Azaz: Pate de foie gras, soupe a l'oignon, faisan sous cloche, salade endive, fromages et fruits et demi-tasse." (Servants Marching, Music in Rhythm with Chewing) Food (whispering): Your majesty, ladies and- Milo: But that's my speech! I didn't know I was going to have to eat my words. King (chewing): Of- of course you do. That's what we're all doing. (Chews). You, you, you should have made a tastier speech. (Gasps). I seem to have a touch of indigestion. Milo: Perhaps you've eaten too much too quickly. Azaz: Too be sure, too much, too quickly. I most certainly haven't eaten too little, too slowly. Or too much, too slowly. Or too little, too quickly. Or taken all day to eat nothing. Or eaten everything in no time at all. (Chair Creaks) Milo: But wouldn't that be just as bad? Azaz: You mean just as good. Things which are "just as bad" also are equally good. Try to look at the bright side of things, Milo. Milo: I don't know what side of anything to look at. Everything is so confusing! And all your words only make things worse. Azaz: How true. Words seem to have lost their meaning. Milo: But there must be something you can do about it. Couldn't you pass a law- or something? Azaz: We have almost as many laws as we have words, but the laws don't make any sense either. Milo: Perhaps you might allow - I mean uh, because you are a wise and -and righteous and just king, you might allow... Rhyme and- and Reason to return? Azaz: How nice that would be... No! No, no never! Not while that stubborn brother of mine... (*Gently) Things always did go very well when they were here. (*Gruffly) I won't allow it! Milo: Why not? Azaz: (Gently) Why not? (Gruffly) Why not, indeed! Azaz: (Gently) Yes. Why not? My boy, I cannot tell you how it would solve all our problems, if only you could bring back Rhyme and Reason. (Humbug Snores) Bee: Odious wasp, eh? (Bee Zooms) Bee: Didactic Drone? Bee: Parsimonious word miser, is it? Azaz: Perhaps someone else among my faithful court would volunteer to join this brave boy in his efforts to rescue Rhyme and Reason? (Music of Dismay Plays) Azaz: No volunteers? (Humbug Snores) Bee: Insectious Humbugious, ey? We'll see. Azaz: Wonderful! A volunteer! Congratulations. Milo: That's great! With the Humbug's help, I know we can do it! Azaz: Goodbye, my boy. Here, in this bag, are all the words and ideas I know. With them, you may ask all the questions which have never been answered. And answer all the questions which have never been asked. All the great books of the past, and all the ones yet to come, are in that bag. Go now. But remember, use these words well,and there is no obstacle you cannot overcome. Azaz: Goodbye. Milo/Tock: Goodbye! Milo: And thank you. Goodbye! Azaz: Goodbye! (Music Begins) (Adventurous Music Plays) Milo: Wow, what a mess! How will we ever get through that? (Music of Confidence) (Humbug Knocks/Kicks Wood)* Humbug: It is of no use my lad. The wall is absolutely impenetrable. However, your heroic effort shall not be unrewarded. Our eternal gratitude will be yours. Shall we start back? Milo: Now look here, Mr. Humbug. If you think for one minute that- Dodecahedron: I say young man, what seems to be your problem? Milo: Who are you? Dodecahedron: My angles are many, my sides are not few. I'm the Dodecahedron, and who are you? Milo: What's a dode-kaheadrun? Tock: As I remember it, it's a twelve-sided mathematical shape. Dodecahedron: See for yourself. I usually use one at a time... saves wear and tear. By the way, what was your problem? Milo: We have to get to Digitopolis to ask the Mathema- Dodecahedron: The only way to get there is through the Numbers Mine. Milo: Numbers Mine? But we can't get through there. The entrance is blocked tight. Tock: Milo, you remember how you got us out of the Doldrums? Milo: Yeah, maybe we can think our way through! Dodecahedron: Can you remember any mathematics? Milo: Let's see. Things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other. (Wood Cracking) Dodecahedron: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 is known as the- Milo: Fibonacci Series! (Wood Cracking) Dodecahedron: Vectors have both magnitude and directions... Milo: Scalars have only magnitude! (Door Crashes/Crashes on Ground) Milo: We did it, we did it! Humbug: (Laughs) Yes, yes. We handled that brilliantly, my boy. 'Tis a good thing we knew the Fibonacci Series, eh? (Laughs) Yes, ee-dee. (Pleasant Flute Music Plays) Milo: Golly. And I used to think numbers weren't important or valuable. Mathemagician: Not important? Not valuable? Humbug: It's- it's the Mathemagician. Mathemagician: By the 4,827, 659 hairs on my head, I'll tell you what's important. Mathemagician (singing): You couldn't have 1 fine day without the 1, could you? You couldn't have tea for 2 without the 2, could you? You couldn't have 3 blind mice without the 3, so you see? Numbers are the 4, 5, 6, 7, 8- Wonders of the World! If you had a big plan, how would you know how big? Numbers! If you had a high hope, how would you know how high? Numbers! If you had a deep bog, how would you know how deep? If you had a close call, how would you know how close? If you had a wide choice, how would you know how wide? Numbers! Numbers! That's how! Numbers can be decimated, verified, manipulated, carried forward, backward, and replaced. Numbers can be added to, subtracted from, divided into, multiplied by, crossed out, and erased. But not with words. You're stuck with words. Words are things you have to keep, have to watch, have to weigh, have to mind, have to know, have to say. (Singing) But it's amazing what a digit or two can do. Why anything you cannot figure out, they figure out for you. And when troubles mount and they become too much to bear. (Bag Drops Heavily) Never Fear. (Talking) Just divide them and divide them. And divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, until they disappear. Nothing counts like numbers. Numbers! Numbers, wonderful numbers! Those Dewey decimal dearies, square root and mix them in series, They give the heart inspiration, no words can bring such elation! 1 to 9, they're the most. Pour the wine, drink a toast to- Numbers! (Music Ends Dramatically) Mathemagician: Welcome to my workshop! Humbug: Very impressive, Your Majesty. But, could you show us the biggest number there is? Heh, heh. That will give him something to figure out. Mathemagician: Very well, Sir Humbug. What's the biggest number you can think of? Humbug: 9,999,999, 000,999 and 9/10. Mathemagician: Very good. Now add 1 to it. Humbug: Add 1? Mathemagician: Now add 1 to that. Add 1 again. Add 1 again. Add 1 again. Add 1 agai- Milo: But he'd never be able to stop that way. Mathemagician: Never. For the number you hope for is always at least one more than the one you have. And that's so large that if you start saying it yesterday, you wouldn't finish 'til tomorrow. I hope that's clear to you. Milo: Nothing's very clear to me. Here, or in Dictionopolis. Mathemagician: (Gruffly) Right! It's all the fault of that wretched brother of mine, King Azaz. (Gently) Ever since the little princesses left, nothing make sense. (Gruffly) And it's all his fault! Milo: (clears throat) If you please sir, we'd like to rescue Rhyme and Reason. Mathemagician: (Gruffly) Rescue Rhyme and Reason? ! (Gently) Rescue Rhyme and Reason? What a wonderful idea! (Gruffly) Wait, has Azaz agreed to it? Tock: Yes sir, he has. Mathemagician: Then I don't. We've never agreed on anything, and we never will. Milo: And if I can prove otherwise, can we have permission to go? Mathemagician: Of course, of course. Milo: Very well then. Now if Azaz agrees with something, then you disagree, correct? Mathemagician: Correct. Milo: And anything Azaz disagrees with, you agree, is that correct? Mathemagician: (blowing) Correct. Milo: Then each of you agrees that he will disagree with the other, right? Mathemagician: Right. Milo: Then you admit that you do agree with Azaz about something. You agree about disagreeing! (Surprised Music) Mathemagician: I've been tricked! (Music of Dismay Plays) Mathemagician: Again, I want to thank you for showing me how foolish and stupid I've been. But this gift can supply you with all the numbers, theorems, equations, and mathematical ideas the world has ever known, or ever will know. Use it well, and there is nothing it can't do for you. Milo: Thank you! Mathemagician: Goodbye and good luck. Milo: Goodbye. Mathemagician: Goodbye. Milo: Goodbye! (Violin/Tambourine Music Plays) Milo: Tock, look! Is that a demon? Humbug: Quick, let's go back! Tock: No, no, no. That's the man I told you about. That's Chroma the Great. The one sane man left in this country. Milo: You mean the one who conducts rainbows, and sunrises and sunsets and things? Tock: Right. We're lucky. It looks like he's ready to conduct today's sunset. Watch! (Birds/Bugs Chirping) (Conductor's Baton Raps on Music Stand) (Birds/Bugs Continue Chirping) (Mystical Music Plays) (Music/Chimes Correspond With Movement of Chroma's Fingers) (Pleasant Music Plays/Chimes Continue) Milo: That was a very beautiful sunset, sir. Chroma: Why, thank you my boy. I've only been practicing since the world began. Sometime, I'll get it just right. Milo: I thought it was perfect. Chroma: You ought to see my lightning, and fireworks! (Wand Chiming) Chroma: (Yawns) Well, good night my boy. Oh, don't forget to wake me at 5:23, for the sunrise. Oh. I really, really must get some sleep. Tock (loud whisper): Milo, Milo! Come on, we're wasting time. Milo (loud whisper): I can't! I have to wake Chroma for the sunrise. Humbug (loud whisper): Why don't you conduct the sunrise yourself, Milo? (Humbug Laughs Menacingly to Himself) Humbug (loud whisper): Save us a lot of time! And you won't have to disturb Chroma- at all! Milo: Hey, that's a great idea, I'll do it! Tock: Why, you fool! What did you tell him to do that for? Do you know what trouble he can- (Conductor's Baton Raps on Music Stand) Tock: No, Milo. No! (Pleasant Music Plays) (Frightening Music Begins) (Sounds of Explosions) (Thunder Clasps) (Siren-Like, Warped Music Begins) Tock (slow, warped voice): Oh no. (Warped Music Continues*) Tock: Come on, come on! We have to get out of here before Chroma wakes up. (Warped Time is a Gift Music Plays) Milo: Now there's no sense any place. And it's all my fault. (Warped Adventurous Music Plays) Senses Taker: Names? I must have your names before you can proceed. Milo: Well uh, this is the Humbug. Senses Taker: Humbug. Milo: This is Tock. Senses Taker: Tock. Milo: And my name is Milo. Now can we go? Senses Taker: Milo. Ooh... I haven't had an "M" in ages. Now then, if you'll just tell me: when you were born; where you were born; why you we born; how old you are; how old you were then; what grade you're in; Your shoe size; shirt size; collar size; hat size; and the names and bank references of six people who can verify this information- then you can go. Milo: What do you need all this for? We're in a hurry. Senses Taker: I'm the official Senses (*Census) Taker. I must have this information before I take your senses. So now, if you will fill out in triplicate: your height; your weight; how many ice cream cones you eat in a week; how many you don't eat in a week; Senses Taker: how many you would like- Milo: We can't waste the time. We've got to get to the Milo: Castle in the Air! (Thunder Roars) Senses Taker: That does it! Now I'm going to take your sense of duty, your sense of precaution, (Menancing Voice) and especially, your sense of direction. (Spinning Music Plays) Tock: Milo! The bottle of laughter! Use this bottle of laughter I got from Dr. Dischord. He can't take away our sense of humor! (Bottle Pops Open, Laughing Begins in Car) Senses Taker: (Gruffly) Stop That! Senses Taker: (Laughs) Stop that, stop that at - (Laughs) at- at once. (Laughing Continues) Senses Taker (Laughing): Stop...stop. Woooo! Heee! (Ominous, Adventurous Music Plays) Terrible Trivium: Hello, little boy. Milo (breathing heavily): Huh? Terrible Trivium: Welcome to you, your faithful dog, and that handsome gentleman. I'm so terribly happy to see all of you. But before you travel on, I wonder if you could spare me a little time, and assist me with a few trivial tasks. Humbug: Why of course! We're in no hurry. Tock (whispering): Don't do it, Milo. Milo: But Tock, we need all the friends we can get up here! Besides, it's only for a little while. Terrible Trivium: Now young man, if you will take those exquisite tweezers, and move this pile of sand from here to here. Milo: With these? ! Terrible Trivium: Of course. And you sir, have the privilege of taking this delicate needle and digging a hole through this cliff. Humbug: Why, thank you, sir! An exacting assignment, quite worthy of my talents. I shall enjoy it to no end. Tock (whispering): Don't be a fool, bug! I think this bird is the Terrible Tri- Terrible Trivium: And you sir, get to take this eyedropper, and empty that well. Milo: But these tasks don't seem very important. Terrible Trivium: Of course they're not important. If you always do the easy and useless jobs, you'll never have to worry about the important ones. Humbug: Right. Tock: Now I know who you are, you're the Terrible Trivium! Terrible Trivium: Quite correct. The Terrible Trivium, demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs. Ogre of wasted effort. Milo: Come on, Humbug! Let's get outta here! Terrible Trivium: And friend to lazy and foolish people everywhere. (Tock Barks Loudly, Terrible Trivium Boings Into Tree) Tock: Run Milo, Run! Intriguing Jazzy Music Plays Terrible Trivium: Come back, come back! There are so many things to take away, and things to bring back. Humbug: So many stamps to lick, so many pencils to sharpen. Terrible Trivium: There are so many holes to dig, Humbug: So many nails to straighten, Terrible Trivium: so many doodles to doodle. Humbug: so many goofs to off. Terrible Trivium: Come back! There are are you doing he... oh, the, uh, the letter for Pi... the... I just, I'm about to... I just gotta make a few tweaks. - You haven't written it. - Not all... not yet. I thought you might need some help... So I came up with some talking points for you. Oh, good. Okay, um... "Outstanding person... natural leader." Dad, I know you and Pi don't always see eye-to-eye. If you don't feel comfortable doing this... No, listen, hey... Hey, Pi and I see eye-to-eye on one very important redheaded thing. - I love you. - I love you, too. Hey! Can you believe that about Mandy Sutton? - It's weird, right? - Yes, weird... Remember how much I loved her show, and those secret identity glasses? If you were mad at me, I'd wear a pair of glasses to dinner, and you'd pretend like you didn't know who I was? I remember, actually... But then she grew up. And whoa! I mean, how does that happen to someone... becoming such a hot mess? I... Oh, my God. - I... thought you were... - Yeah. Alexis, this is Mandy. We're just, uh, keeping her under wraps for now. This is my daughter. Hmm. It's nice to meet you. No, dad, it's not true. Yes, I know what they wrote. We're still engaged. What do you mean aunt Theresa put it on her Facebook? Well, t... tell her to take it down. I gotta go. I love you. Bye. Hey, Espo. Do you believe everything - that they write in the newspapers? - Oh. Hell, no. I mean, except for that thing between Castle and his ex-wife. I mean, it's... Did you find anything on Claire? As a matter of fact, I did. I went into the phone records of that limo company. It turns out that Claire was the one who ordered that limo last night. Why would Claire order a limo to take her to Mandy's place? I don't know. But I just got off the phone with Claire's roommate. Said Claire's been going through some things the last couple of days. She's been upset... crying. Hey. Those photos of Mandy in her bedroom... I traced the printer's serial number to an electronics store in midtown. According to the extended warranty, it belongs to a Ken Castor. So he's done time. For aggravated assault. And then two years ago, he was hit with a restraining order for stalking... Mandy Sutton. Old habits die hard. And those paparazzi photos from the night that she was killed, I went through them. Look who was right there when Claire stepped out of that limo... Same guy. Police! N.Y.P.D.! Kitchen clear. Bedroom clear! Hey. Closet. Aah! Aah! Let go of me! Let go of me! Gimme your arm! I didn't do anything! You okay? Yeah. I think we got our guy. No, listen. You don't understand. The hell we don't. We know that you took those pictures, Ken. We know that you were in her apartment. Because she needed me. Needed you? I was protecting her. I was watching over her, and she... She needed that. Right. 'Cause she didn't have people watching her and staring at her already. They didn't care. Not like me. They... they... They don't understand her. I mean, they drove her to it, you know? That's why I sent her the pictures... because she needed to know that someone cared. She... she needed to know that someone was watching. Is that what you were doing outside of her apartment last night? Watching? I-I should have saved her. But I-I never saw her. I-I-I waited for the limo, but then that girl came out... the... the not Mandy, the other girl. So I-I went around to the back alley, and I waited across the street. When the other girl goes in the front, that means that Mandy goes in the back. But... but she didn't. Wait, you waited for Mandy out in back? Yeah. Did you see anything else? Did you see anyone go in or out of that alley? J-just the motorcycle. Wait a minute. What... What motorcycle? Well, right when I was going in the back, there was a motorcycle that was going into the... the alley. What time? When? 10:07. I-I-I wrote it down. I-I write everything down. And then at, uh, 10:12, it, uh, it left. Did you get a license plate? I couldn't write it down. It was going too fast. What about the rider? Did you see his face? They were wearing a helmet. I-I didn't know Mandy was back there. I mean, I-I never saw her go back, you know? What about the motorcycle? Color? Trim? I wrote that down. It was... it was red. It was, um... Uh... It was a red Ducati 800 Supersport. It had gold wheels, and it had a flame decal on the body. What do you think? He's a nut job. But he's probably not our killer. Yeah? How's that? Unlike the paparazzi, he knew Claire was getting out of the limo. So he can tell them apart. And since he's obsessed with Mandy, there would be no reason for him to go after Claire. We'll hold him. But if he's not our killer, he's probably our best witness. Why don't we get ahold of traffic cam footage in the area? Let's see if we can get a plate on that Ducati. Gold wheels, a flame decal on the body. It's gotta be a custom job. Yeah. I'll check with bike shops in the area, see if I can find the place that did that work. Where's Castle? He's having dinner with his other ex-wife, something about not wanting her to feel left out. Good one. He's holed up in the break room writing that letter for Alexis' boyfriend. Thank you. Will you stop worrying? He'll have lots of great things to say about you. I guarantee it. I don't know. I'm not exactly Mr. C.'s favorite person. And he is taking an awfully long time. He does have other things to do, you know. No, Al, that's not what I meant. Maybe he's done by now. He said he'd text me when it was ready. Let's see. That's weird. My phone's off. That's... not my ring. Hello? You have my phone. Mandy? Hi. Uh, yeah, I just realized. Funny, we must have switched. I need it. I'm at the Wessex Hotel. Okay. Sure. Oh, it's... not like I took it on purpose or anything, just a misunderstanding. Room 522. Yeah, sure. Not a... Hello? I guess I'm bringing Mandy her phone. I-I gotta head uptown. The bee pupae are emerging. See you later? - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Oh! Mwah! Hey. Hey, so, uh... Here's your phone. Okay. Look, I'm sorry about that whole "hot mess" thing I said before. Sorry that you said it, or sorry that I heard it? I... should probably go. It happens when you're not looking. Excuse me? Before... you asked how it happens... how someone becomes like me. It happens when you're not looking, and by the time you realize it, it's already who you are. Like the car crash on the side of the road everybody stops and... and watches. That doesn't mean it's who you have to be. You can always change. Turns out I don't do change so well. But... you steal a police car, and you set it on fire, I'm your girl. Or if you find the greatest guy in the world, fall madly in love, and then mess it up by hooking up with my dirtbag ex? That I can do. Yeah, I... Saw that picture online. You and the rest of the world. Maybe if you didn't drink. If I don't drink, then I start to feel. And I don't like what I feel. I wish I had those glasses from "Mandy Melody." I'd just put 'em on and... Just disappear. I know how you feel. How could you possibly know how I feel? Because right now, I... Wish I could disappear from my life, too. Okay, thanks. I'll check back. Hey. So how's Pi's recommendation going? It took me less time to write the last Derrick Storm novel. And although they both are works of fiction, at least that one was believable. How's the case coming? Well, we got a description of the motorcycle that left the crime scene, and tech's trying to get a plate off of traffic cam footage, but so far no luck. Our luck just changed. We got the son of a bitch. We found a shop that outfitted a red Ducati 800 with gold wheels and a flame decal for one Josh Greenberg. Is that our guy? Josh Greenberg had a slight liquidity problem. So he sold that bike three days ago for cash to... This guy. Jesse Jones... Mandy's ex. So he lied to us. He was in that alley. All right. Bring him in. We already sent a car over to his place. He's not there. Mandy might be able to help out. She probably knows his hangouts. All right, go. The thing about my boyfriend is... I thought I was being so grown-up... moving in with him, getting my own place. But now it's my whole life. And I'm pretty sure I've made a huge mistake. Do you know why I'm helping him with his grant application? Because if he gets it, he'll have to travel. That is messed up. You need to tell him. Tell him what? That I changed my mind? I don't want a relationship? We have a lease. That's romantic. And he doesn't deserve it. He hasn't done anything wrong. Oh! And then there's my dad. What do I tell him, huh? That he was right all along, that I wasn't ready? I wish I would have said that. I wasn't ready for so many things. Do you ever look back on something you've done and... it's like someone else is doing it? You're kidding, right? Right. Sorry, I... Haven't had anyone to talk to. Clearly. "Be true to yourself." That's what Zach would say. And if a situation is bad for you, leave it. That's what we were going to do. And that's what you should do, too. Mandy, is someone texting you? Weird, since I'm supposed to be dead. Oh, it's my friend Sam. "Pretty sure you're not dead. "Need to talk about girl who died, something you need to know"? Wait, what... what are you doing? Calling him? But you're supposed to be laying low. No one's supposed to know you're alive. He already knows I'm alive. He thinks you're alive. He might be trying to find out for sure. And what if it's not Sam? It could be the killer trying to lure you out. Would you relax? It's Sam's number, okay? And he's not answering, which means he's probably bartending. That place he works is really loud. I have to go see him. You can't go out. What if someone sees you? You don't get it, do you? I am the one that is supposed to be dead, not Claire. She died because of me. And I know that people think that I don't care, but I'm not a monster. If Sam has information about Claire's death, I need to know what it is. I just want to do one thing right. Mandy! You shouldn't be doing this. Yeah, well, you're not gonna stop me. Okay, but if you're going to do it, you can't be recognized. Do you understand? You're going to need someone to do all the talking for you. Come on. Mandy's gone? ! Gone where? We're not sure. No one at the front desk saw her leave. Are there any signs of foul play? Nah, it looks like she just took off. Maybe she, uh, picked up where she left off on that bender. You guys gotta come back. We have to coordinate a search. We'll check with the limo company, see if she called for a pickup. And I'll talk to her mom. I'll get a list of all the places she likes to go to. We have to find her before Jesse figures out that he killed the wrong person. What? What happened? Where's Mandy? Are you sure I can't talk you out of this? There he is. There's Sam. Are you crazy? ! What are you doing? That's what I'm here for. Sam! Hey, Sam! That's not gonna get the job done there, red. You want to lose some layers? Take off grandma's scarf. I have something else in mind. So she was like, "can you believe it?" And I was like, "no way." I am so sorry. Are you okay? Oh. Oh, Sam... Right? Can I please get her another drink? Oh, and, um... There's someone here to see you. Mandy? Oh, my God, girl, is that you? Can we talk somewhere more private? Yeah, um... Y'all meet me over there. Yo, I am so glad that you're okay. You had me worried. I saw those pictures of you and Jesse, then the next thing you know, everybody's saying that you're dead? What made you think I wasn't? That clip on the news... the one of the limo dropping "you" off at your building last night, except that girl wasn't you. How could you tell? 'Cause that same girl was in here last night wearing the same thing she had on as when she got out of that limo. Wait a second. Claire was here last night? Yeah, yeah. I think that's what her name was. You talked to her? Yeah, she came in looking for me. She heard I was friends with Mandy. She wanted her private number. What for? She was trying to reach you because she thought somebody was trying to hurt you. Who? She didn't say, but she got way mad when I wouldn't give her your number. Yeah, I... man, I thought this girl was nuts... you know, a crazy fan or something. Then she asked me how she can get in touch with Jesse. Jesse? What does he have to do with this? I don't know, but... She was pretty hot to talk to him, too. So I called Jesse, and I put him on with her. What'd she say? I didn't hear, but she was pretty upset. And since she ended up dead, I thought you should know. Hey, Sam! Hey, uh... Wait here a second. People gettin' thirsty over there. I don't get it. Did Claire know Jesse? I don't know. I didn't think she did. There's only one way to find out. I'm calling Jesse. Wait. He could be involved. If Claire thought someone was trying to kill you, do you really think it's a good idea to call... anybody ever tell your friend that she looks like Mandy Sutton? Yeah, she gets that all the time. It's a shame what happened to Mandy, isn't it? Hey, that is Mandy. Oh, my God. Mandy Sutton is alive. Mandy Sutton's alive! There's still no word on Jesse's whereabouts. Same with Mandy. But get this... when I called the limo company to see if she ordered up a ride from her hotel tonight, they said she didn't, but they told me that I wasn't the only guy asking that question. Someone else called? Yeah, some guy who said that he was with her management company. But I checked. No one there made that call. Jesse. Maybe he found out that she was still alive. Looks like everyone just did. ...That Mandy Sutton, presumed dead, may actually be alive. Mandy was reportedly just spotted at trendy downtown nightspot the Raptor Lounge. And now he knows where to find her. Hello? Yeah. Where? We gotta get her out of there. Yeah. I'll send a car to pick her up. And we have some footage from the Raptor Lounge shot just moments ago and posted by one of our viewers. Uh... Castle, I-isn't that... that's ale-Alexis. What is she doing there? Mandy! Yes, I am alive! Don't trample me to death. Mandy! We have to get out of here. Uh... Oh! This way. Come on. Um, I'm gonna call my dad. Let's get out of here first. Speak of the devil, and she appears. I need to talk to you. Yeah, same here. Get in. I'm not so sure that's a good idea. Get in, both of you. Get out. Just get out. Out! Now! Get over here! Sorry I dragged you into this. Well... I want answers. Answers about what? Someone is messing with me, and I know you're involved somehow. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't lie to me! Guys, let's just calm down, okay? I'm sure we can talk this out. Shut up. Hey! Jesse, look at me. I made a mistake. Okay, I-if you thought whatever happened the other night between us meant that we were getting back together, I'm sorry, but that's not what's gonna happen. You know that wasn't you the other night in that photo. What? If it wasn't her, then who was it? It's that chick, Claire. I got paid 25 grand to show up and suck face with her for a couple minutes. You're telling me that you really don't know? No! I was messed up that night. I don't remember anything. I don't even remember getting messed up. Maybe you didn't. Maybe somebody drugged you so you wouldn't remember. And then I-I would see the photos and assume that it was me? Jesse... How could you do that to me? This isn't about you, not anymore. What happened, Mandy? Hmm? Who killed Claire? I don't know. What do you care? I care 'cause the cops are trying to pin it on me. Someone must have seen me in the alley that night. Wait a minute. You were there, when she was killed? I had to talk to her. Now we were supposed to get another 25 grand for staging that photo, if we kept our mouth shut when the story ran. Only bitch got a conscience, felt bad about everything she had done, especially 'cause the pictures broke up you and what's his name... Zach. She just had to set things right. That's why she was trying to get in touch with you last night. She called me and said she was going over to your place to tell you everything. Only that means I'm not gonna get my money. So I go over there to talk her out of it, that's it! And when I get there, she's dead. Jesse, if you didn't kill Claire, then put the gun down. We can go to the police together and figure this out. I promise... you're trying to confuse me! Now shut up before I do something I... Turn around right now, Jesse! Drop that gun, Jesse! Show 'em! Show your hands! Down! Now, now! Dad. Hey. It's okay. It's over. If Jesse's story is true, then Claire was about to reveal that those photos were fake and someone killed her for it. So maybe Claire Samuels was the intended target after all. If Jesse's story is true. That's a big "if." All right, thanks,Bill. So Jesse was telling the truth about this much... he deposited $25,000 cash in his bank account five days ago. Any more on who paid him? No, we got a typewritten note that told him when to meet Claire at the bar and where to find the money at a dead drop. Why would someone pay that much money to stage a photo in the first place? And what was so important about it that someone would kill Claire in order to keep it from being exposed as a fake? I don't know, but I could think of someone who might. Guys, did Jesse tell you where in the club that photo was taken? Somewhere in the back hidden from view. Couldn't be any witnesses, or the gag wouldn't work. So that photographer didn't just happen to be there. He was in on it. So who's the photographer? James Lockhart. How you doin'? N.Y.P.D. We gotta ask you some questions, bro. Listen, can you guys come back a little later? Excuse me? There's an actress in this cafe, Reese Wellingford? I've been waiting an hour for her to come out. Listen, fool, this is a criminal investigation. Who paid you to take those pictures you sold to "Celebgazer"? The ones with Jesse Jones and the girl who wasn't Mandy Sutton? Nobody paid me. Oh, really? So you just ended up in that backroom, in that bar when those two hooked up? Yep, just lucky, I guess. Here she is. Where? I don't even... is she over... where is it? Did you see her? I don't even see her. Is she... am I... am I in the way? Oh, you can't, uh, um... Oh, hey! Oh, there she goes. She's right there. Oh, no. Oh. She got in a cab. All right, look, I got a tip, okay? They said show up at such and such time, go in the back. I got a few shots before security threw me out. So who gave you that tip? I can't tell you that. I thought we were cool. Oh, come on. You think I'm gonna rat out my sources? This is my livelihood. How do you think your livelihood's gonna go with me and my boy here following you around all day? He didn't just run that photo on "Celebgazer," he set the whole thing up. But why? Doesn't this dirtbag have enough scandals to report on without having to make up his own? Because it wasn't just about the one scandal. For years, Mandy has been drawing millions of eyeballs to "Celebgazer," with her public meltdowns, or drunken escapades, the, uh, trips to rehab. But in the past few months, she calmed down, got her life back in order. Because of Zach. Which was no good for business. So Harvey staged the photo, turns Mandy back into the train wreck that he grew to love and exploit. And it worked, too, until Claire was gonna ruin it all by calling the photo out as a hoax, destroying Harvey's reputation. And that's why Harvey was at the apartment. He wasn't waiting for Mandy. He was waiting for Claire. He was waiting to silence her. Fake? No, no, no, no. And yet you ran that one. Come on, Harvey. We know you set the whole thing up. You paid Jesse, then you paid Claire. I didn't pay anyone. And who is Claire? The girl in the photo. The one that you killed right after she threatened to expose you? Wait a minute. I had nothing to do with any of this. So then how did you get that photo? I bought it from a freelancer. We spoke with him. He said that you sent him to that bar, which means you knew Claire and Jesse were there. How did you know? The same way I always know. I was tipped! Do you actually expect us to believe that? It's true! I swear. I remember exactly when it happened. They called my cell. I can show you. Yo, that phone call Harvey got came from a burner phone paid for with cash. So they were covering their tracks. Yeah, only they didn't do a very good job of it. They forgot to disable the G.P.S. We were able to track the G.P.S. data. Yeah. That phone was in the alley behind Mandy's building the night of the murder. So then whoever bought that phone is our killer. Thank you for coming in. We, uh, we just wanted to keep you up-to-date on the investigation. So there's been a development? Yes, we have a lead. We've identified the cell phone of the person that set up that fake photo. And we believe the same person killed Claire Samuels. Who is it? Well, actually, it was a burner phone. A burner phone? So it's not traceable. Uh, normally, it wouldn't be. But the person who bought this phone made one crucial mistake. They didn't get rid of it when they were done. Matter of fact, it's still on right now. Mom? Mom! You set up that photo? You did this to me? Why would you do that? Why do you wanna ruin my life? It was Zach who was ruining your life. I was saving you. Wait a minute. Wait. You did this to break me up with Zach? He was the best thing that ever happened to me. He was gonna take me away from all of this. That's right, away from everything we'd worked for... your tour, your career, he was gonna cost you millions. You mean cost you millions? And for what? A chance to be normal! Normal. You're special. Zach didn't understand that. And neither did Claire. So you... killed her? She was gonna tell you what I'd done. She was gonna make you hate me. I couldn't let her drive a wedge between us. I couldn't. Marilyn Sutton, please stand up. Turn around. You're under arrest for the murder of Claire Samuels. Mandy, sweetie, you understand, right? I did this for you, Mandy. Everything I did, I did for you. No, mom. You did it for you. Let's go. Just when I thought life couldn't get any more messed up, right? And the train wreck continues. The press is gonna love this. Sorry. I'm gonna go. Thank you. Um, hey, Mandy. Sorry, um, not to pry, but, uh, it would be really easy just to run and hide from all this. But don't. Thanks. Thank you for all you guys did. Um, could you thank Alexis for me, too, please? I will. Yeah, she was here. Actually, I don't know where she went. There's, oh... I'm back, and I've brought someone with me. Hey, Mandy. Zach. Once we realized Mandy hadn't really cheated on him, I tracked him down. I thought he needed to know. Good. I hope it works out for them. Mandy needs something good in her life. They've got a shot. They seem to really love each other for all the right reasons. Oh, um, speaking of boyfriends... Pi's letter of recommendation. He did get the deadline extended, right? No, he did. Good. How did I spell "Pi"? Did I put it like the dessert? 'Cause that was just... no, dad. You got it right. Okay. I'm just not sure I did. Where... where you off to? There's something I need to do. Hey, Castle, looks like your love life made the paper again. Ah, what? All right. All right, who am I hooking up with now? "Novelist Richard Castle and New York police detective "Katherine Beckett, both native New Yorkers, are pleased to announce their engagement." No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't... I did... I didn't do this. Actually, I did. I thought you... I know, I know, Castle. I like my privacy. But I do realize that you're somewhat famous. Somewhat? I... yes. And if we're gonna be together, I have to come to terms with that, and if they are gonna write about you, I want it to be the truth. I want it to be about us. Well, there's no one I... there's no one I'd rather share a headline with. But just for the interest of accuracy... Does it say we're getting married in space? No, it's not gonna happen, babe. Be pretty fun. Space. 2 kilometers from Thailand's border Check-Point Trade Border at Siam Trang bay Here you are. Why do you come to Thailand? To deliver some goods. What's in your bag? Let me see.

Map Kha Industrial Estate 250 km. - Thailand's border After we'd been through the big flood crisis, our company had to recover and restore in several aspects. The staffs from all departments had been co-operating very well. Therefore, our company managed to recover quite fast. She's probably ruined in her area, - but she is a... whore. - I don't... it's not... - I don't want a whore. - I wish Greg would give - me permission to bang a stranger. - No, you do not. - Oh, yes, I do. - No. Mm-hmm. I am so tired of sleeping with someone who is old enough to be my father's friend. Who also happens to be my father's friend, which is totally on me. Totally on me. Thank you. I used to, like, fully turn Lina on, and now I... I - I just annoy her. - Dude, she loves you. It's like with me and Greg. I know that he loves me, but I also know that he can't keep up with me. Did I tell you that he can only do doggy style if he wears a knee brace? - No. - That's not a sex toy. Doggy's my jam. I don't care about your stupid barbeque. It's my weekend. Yeah. Oh, and another thing, tell your screw pal to stop buying my daughter turtles. I'm her father. Nobody buys her turtles except me, do you understand? - Baby mama drama. Oh. - How is everything working out, you know, for you, divorce-wise? It's a big party. What? No, but you're getting laid a lot. At least, you talk about it a lot. Yeah, and you have a family, huh? You want to know where I spent my last Thanksgiving? At a Panda Express with a dominatrix, all right? Don't try and out-sad me. I am the king of sad. - Congratulations. - Thank you. What's his problem? He's just so sad because his wife says he can have sex with other people. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Did you get it in writing? No. I don't want it in writing. I just want her. - I get it. She's hot, all right? - She is. Sure. Those legs, that ass, those nipples that say howdy. But trust me, man... don't let sex ruin what you guys have. If I could do it all over again I would've just gotten a mistress. It might've saved my marriage. That is actually a smart idea. Excuse me. - No. Don't. - Yes. Do. - Don't. Don't. - Yes. - Excuse me. Hi. - Yeah. How can I help you guys? Well, would you be interested in being my friend's mistress? It's for a good cause. He needs to save his marriage. And don't worry... it's that - friend, not that one. - A mistress. - Um, well, what are the hours like? - Oh. Very honest. - Funny. Okay. - That's very funny. Russ, this is... - I'm Ella. - Oh, that's my daughter's name. - Oh, no way. - Yeah. - That's a good name. - It's a great name. But maybe not so much for a mistress. 'Cause then I'd be, like, inside her and I'm feeling like it's incest. - That's gross. - Don't be so old-fashioned. - You are a buzzkill. - This is not going well. I don't... - No, it's going so poorly. - I find you very - attractive, I just don't want... - I actually have other tables. - Yeah, sure you do. - No, you're released. Thanks, you guys. - Of course you do. Yes, enjoy your other tables. - Okay. If you really are serious about getting a mistress, then you're gonna need to do something about that ear hair that's in there. You need to wax it out or something, - because ear hair is not sexy, it's not... - I'm not getting a mistress. - Why not? - Ugh. You know me, I get too attached. And then there's the cost. Like, Lina would kill me if I was out buying shoes for other women. So keep it on the cheap. Get her some flip-flops or something, you know? Flip-flops and a sandwich, man. That's all it takes. Oh... what are you, so romantic? Well, we're not talking about romance, here. Even if I did do it, right... like, I haven't been single in a very long time. I would ha... have no idea where to start. Start with the ears. Really? _ You know, I've always wondered what the inside of this place looks like. My... my wife used to actually come here and get waxed all the time. That was, uh, that was before we had kids, obviously. Just... Ow. Lately, she's, uh, really let things go, down there. Kind of looks like a pirate. Did you say something? No, I did not. Just, uh... It's... not important. - Are those your girls? - Yeah, three girls. You gonna try for the boy? I don't really care about the boy part, but, uh, I'm always down for trying. I like funny guys. Do you, uh, do you have any kids, or... My ex and I were supposed to have a boy. - Charlie. - Oh. That's what we were going to call him. We were at 23 weeks, and then one day... Now he walks with Jesus. Um... Uh, Charlie is... That's a great name. It's a great name. - Sorry about losing it like that. - Oh, please, don't worry about it. I lose it all the time, so... No, it's, you know, it's hard being with the same person forever, you know, and ever. And ever. - Look how cute. - Aw. After we lost the baby, Angel... my ex... wanted to start trying again. But I couldn't be with him no more. Every time we tried to, uh... I just thought of Charlie, and his cute little sonogram. Maybe God doesn't think I'd be a good mother. Maybe that's why He took Charlie. Oh, thank God you picked up. Hey, uh, I need a favor. Yeah, I'm, um... I need 400 bucks. - Thank you so much, dude. - There you go, $400. Oh, you're a lifesaver. - So, this is it, you're getting a whore. - No, of course not. - Uh, okay, okay. - But do me a favor, though... Don't say anything to Cindy, she'll say something to Lina. Then Lina will know - you're getting a whore. - Again, Bernie, not - getting a whore, okay? - Right, okay. - Thank you. - I won't say anything. But, uh, if it is a whore, just promise me... don't choke her. I don't want to get that call. Hands off. - Here you go. - Oh, you're crazy. Well, you said he was cute, right? We should call him Charlie. - Hi, Charlie. - Charlie, like, like, Charlie, Charlie? - Oh, my little Charlie. - I was... Yeah, I was... I was just thinking maybe, like, Hercules, you know, or, uh... Okay, we'll go with Charlie, I guess. - You gonna come in, right? - I don't know, uh... - Maybe just for a minute. - Sorry about the mess. I didn't know I was having company. Hola, tia. This is my friend Russ and our new little doggie. Oh. So you want to watch TV? Uh, I have a TV at home, so... Think I'm probably good... with that. Love all the shelving. Okay. - Wow, this is soft, huh? - Yeah. Uh... - I got to take this. - What? What's up? Uh, no, I'm just out right now. - Where are you? - I'm just, uh, running some errands. Bullshit. What errands are you running? I run every errand in this house. You need to get home. Fine. - When? - I don't know... like 20 minutes. Okay, bye. Look, I... I got to go. - You gonna come back? - You know, I... I don't think it's a good idea. Yeah, I feel like I could be back in an hour. Can you pick up some food for Charlie? Maybe a chew toy. A chew toy. Okay. - What is the emergency? - Norman died. The fish. Oh. Right. I put too much food in his bowl. Aw, sweetie. We all make mistakes. - You need to put a suit on. - Why? - For the funeral. - He was just a fish. - He was my friend. - Girls, go in the backyard, I want to talk to daddy for a minute. Daddy? Look, I'm sorry I killed the fish. Why did you borrow $400 from Bernie? What are you talking about? - Oh, please. - I didn't... No, yeah, you did. Cindy called and said that you told Bernie to meet you with $400. That's... I... Oh, right, okay. - Yeah, mm-hmm. - I remember that now. Okay. - That was... - I know that I told you that you can do whatever you want, but can you please be discreet and not borrow whore money - from our friends? - I didn't get a whore. Oh, really? then what was the $400 for? It was... I can't tell you that. It's a... surprise. Well, that surprise better not be AIDS. Herpes? You already gave me that. No, I did not. Oh, I get it. Does it turn you on that I may have had sex with someone else? I thought you said you didn't. I didn't. But if it turns you on that I - did, then I did. - Just get dressed, weirdo. Come on. Hello, caller. Please leave a message and someone will get back to you. Hey, dick, it's me. Yeah, um, just calling to say thanks again, you know, for opening your big mouth. I'm trying to... - Save my marriage, here. - Norman was a great friend. He was also family. He was the only one I could talk to. And you always understood me. You were a great fish. - You make cute kids. - So do you. - Except for this one. - Yeah. - Whose kid is this? - I don't know. - Whose kid is this? - She lives next door. Do we know you? Do we know you? We were just in the backyard having a funeral, you know, for Norman. Yeah. And I thought, like, what the f... hell am I doing? Are you going to see this girl again or are you not? It's complicated. I don't know. I have to get her dog food. You're making her eat dog food. - Okay. - Why are you buying her dog food? Because I may have bought her a dog. Oh. Oh! You idiot! That's so stupid. - Why would you do that? - How does that happen? Because you told me to get my ears waxed. Yeah, I did. I asked you to get your ears waxed. That does not mean that you should get a dog. I know. I'm an idiot, okay? This is exactly why I can't have - a mistress. I need your help. - No, no, no, no. You don't need help. It's not complicated. It's simple. Just don't go back there. - I promised this woman dog food. - Just trust me. - Don't go back there. - You're right. I'm done. I'm done. I'm not gonna bring her the dog food. I'm over the mistress thing. It's done. _ Oh, sorry. I think I have the wrong apartment. - You Russ? - Yes. You got the right place. Hold up. Isis wants you to take care of this little guy. - Uh, where is she? - Hospital. Tia was having chest pains. - Is she okay? - I don't know, man. She's old. Messed-up shit happens all the time. We ain't got no control over it. Something messed up could happen to you right now. Is something messed up about to happen? No, man. I got no claim anymore. Just doing a favor for the ex. Here. His name's Charlie, right? Yeah, I, uh... I definitely... She told you that was what we were gonna name our little man? I wanted to go with Hercules. It's all good. I mean, it isn't. But it has to be, right? That's the world. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's... it is the world. It's definitely the world. Take good care of 'em. Where have you been? You told me to be discreet. So, I was being discreet. Messing with you. - I'm not... - You suck. You want to watch a movie with me? - Vampires or... ? - No. - Werewolves. - Oh. Even better. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Daddy got us a dog! Daddy got us a dog! - Where did you get that? - It was in daddy's car. Daddy bought a dog - without talking to mommy? - Uh, we can, we can return it. - I can, I can easily give it back. - We're not returning - our dog. - No. Good. That's... Of course not. We shouldn't return our dog. You're gonna need a name, aren't you? Thank you, daddy! _ _ _ _ _ _ Hey, buddy. Russ. Hey. - How is she? - She had a little heart attack. But it's okay. She has lots of heart attacks. Who's with Charlie? Um... I think you should sit down. - What? - He ran into the street. Yeah. It was a truck, you know? So, he... - he didn't suffer. - Wait. - He's, he's gone? I... no. - Yeah. I tried to stop the bleeding, but it was... So profuse. - Charlie is dead? ! - Huh? He's dead again! God took him away from me again! Uh... Just text or... I know a great tapas place. Just throwing it out there. - Wow. Yeah. - Whoa! The grandma in the background. It makes it hotter. - Yeah. - I don't know... Is it really over between you guys? Yeah. I think so. She said that every time she sees me, she thinks of Charlie. - Mm. The baby or the dog? - Mm. - Dog, I think. - Ah, that's... - That's less sad. - Yeah, it's better. - You guys want another round? - Mm-mm. I can't, I got to stop. Tonight is the night that I lay out Greg's pills for the week. So, that's part of my life. I wish I had somebody to lay out my pills. I don't even know what I'm taking. Hey. Hey, does this feel weird to you? I'm not touching your penis. How did you know... ? Seriously? You're good. The puppy's right here. (MOTOR ENGINE WHIRRING) (RATTLING) (CHICKENS CLUCKING) I've just crossed the Iranian border en route to the Habala region where they've ordered the destruction of a network of caves by sundown tonight. I believe that these caves might contain a critical missing piece of our history. If I'm found dead, please know that I entered this country of my own free will, fully knowing that the punishment for trespassing here is burial up to your neck in sand and having a rock wall pushed on top of you. But they would have to catch me first. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hurry. Come. Scarlett. SCARLETT: Reza. Thank you. If they catch you, it would be very bad for you. Yes, I know, Reza. We will be quick. Okay. Here it is. REZA: Here, use the ladder. Okay. Okay. (ALARM BLARING) We haven't got much time. SCARLETT: I know, I know. They have already cleared the area. I know, Reza. Hurry. Just follow me. Follow. Come on. Watch your step here. It's fine. Go, just go. Yes. Come on. (WHISPERING) Turn off the light. Turn off the light! Come on. Right this way. (MAN ORDERING INDISTINCTLY OVER LOUDSPEAKER) (MAN ORDERING CONTINUES) (SIREN BLARING) We need to leave. We are too late. No, they are not blowing the caves up until sundown. We still have a few minutes. We're not leaving. Hurry, hurry! Yes. (SIREN CONTINUES) Come on. Shit. REZA: There! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's even more beautiful than in the picture. Okay. We must hurry, please. Okay. There's more. What are you doing? They're going to blow it up anyway. I can't think straight with this thing on my head. They will hear you. Stop! I just need one minute. Oh, my God. (SCARLETT EXHALES) SCARLETT: Oh, my God. Yeah? Reza? Do you know what this is? I don't know. Oh, my God. It's the Rose Key. Oh, Reza. Careful. Please hurry. I'll be quick. Scarlett, stop it. Come on. I have to scan these markings. I'm not leaving. We must leave. Now! I can hear them. My father searched his entire life for this. I can't leave now. I have to get this. I'm sorry, Scarlett. I have a family! I know. It's okay. Be careful. I won't be long. Be careful! SCARLETT: Come on. Come on, Scarlett. (SIREN CONTINUES) Shit. Okay. Okay. MAN: Scarlett. Hello? (SIREN TEMPO SPEEDING UP) (GAGGING) Scarlett. (EXPLOSION) (SCREAMING) (CAVE RUMBLING) Shit! Oh, God! Reza! Reza! Reza! Reza! Scarlett! Over here! Scarlett! (SCARLETT COUGHING) Come over! Come on. Are you okay, dear? Are you okay? Come on. Give me your hand. (SCARLETT COUGHING) I got it! I got it! You remind me so much of your father. But, Scarlett, you must be more careful. (DOGS BARKING) His quest was a path to madness. My father wasn't crazy. Everyone who hunts for Flamel's stone is crazy. They all wind up dead. SCARLETT: Do I look inthecamera? BENJI: Yeah. Thank you. That'sweird. (BENJI CHUCKLING) BENJI: Um, so, you can start byintroducingyourself. Right. (CLEARS THROAT) My name is Scarlett Marlowe and I'm a professor at University College, London. I have a Ph.D. in urban archeology, a master's in chemistry and another Ph.D. in symbology. I'm also fluent in four spoken languages and two dead ones. And I am a black belt in Krav Maga, so watch out. BENJI: That's a lot of degrees for someone your age. Yeah. My father insisted. We had a very studious household. Excuse me. One second. (STAMMERING) Pardon. Pardon. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Merci. Mercibeaucoup. Thank you. You really need to learn French. Yeah, I do need to learn French. (CHUCKLES) Your father. Yeah. What did he teach you about the philosopher's stone? Everything. That it's an elusive substance that could turn base metals into gold and can provide the key to eternal life. Sort of crude representation, but basically the creation of the stone was the goal of alchemy which was an early form of science which studied transformation in all its forms. And my father was actually the world's preeminent historian in alchemy. So, your father, there was a lot of speculation that he was mentally unstable. Is there any truth to that? Why? Because he killed himself? Six hundred years ago the greatest of the alchemists, Nicolas Flamel lived here, in this house in Paris. He was widely believed to have succeeded in developing the philosopher's stone which would have given him all the wealth he could dream of as well as eternal life. When grave robbers, hoping to get their hands on the philosopher's stone tried to dig his body up out of the cemetery that used to surround this area here they found his casket empty, as well as his wife's. Okay. So this is Nicolas Flamel's tombstone which he designed and carved himself. And my father believed that the clues to the location of the philosopher's stone were encoded somehow in these arcane symbols. But their meaning has remained a mystery until I discovered the fabled Rose Key. It's a kind of Rosetta stone used for translating alchemical symbols into Aramaic which, unfortunately, I don't speak. But luckily, I know a guy who does. What are you doing? I just have to open this door quietly. BENJI: Please don't. Scarlett! (DOOR SLAMMING SHUT) I can't believe you just did that. We just broke into a church! What does this guy do all the way up here? Uh. he likes to, um break into places, like this and fix things. Impressive. That's a hell of a hobby. Yeah. SCARLETT: George? Hello? I saw your bag, George. I know you're here. Hi. How are you? Whatever it is, I want nothing to do with it. I didn't even say anything. I'll save you the time. No. Who's this guy? Who are you? I'm Benji. He's making a documentary about my search for the stone. Ah. Of course. Do yourself a favor. Stay far away from this one. I just need to ask you one favor. GEORGE: Yeah. Just one favor. Benji, did she mention to you, the last time we were together I literally wound up in a Turkish prison? (CHUCKLING) George, it was not a prison. It was more of a jail. Jail, in Turkey. George, I'm sorry. I couldn't let the lead go dead. God forbid. Well, chase your lead. See how far that gets you. I got a clock to fix. I found the Rose Key, George. (CHUCKLING) You did? Mmm-hmm. It was in Iran, wasn't it? Yes. I knew it. And I need your help translating the Aramaic. Wait a minute. Did you go to Iran? It doesn't matter who went there, George. You did, didn't you? By yourself? Doesn't matter who went. (CHUCKLES) You're a lunatic. She... You're... (LAUGHING) You're a crazy lunatic. (GEARS CREAKING) So, you fixed it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah! Go, go, go. Come on. SCARLETT: Are you okay, Benji? Yeah, I'm good. Okay. It's about to get really loud. Coming? You coming? BENJI: Yeah, yeah. I'm good. (CHURCH BELLS DINGING) Shit. (BELL TOLLING) (CHUCKLING) Look at them. GEORGE: Hearing their church bells ring for the first time in 284 years. I'll help you translate. But that's it. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) She's pretty. BENJI: Yeah, she's really pretty. She's got great legs, too. She said we can have 10 minutes. That's it. Okay. How do you know her? Professional circles. Star is ammonia. Okay, great. Star is ammonia. Is this making any sense? Just keep going. Just keep them going. Lime. Sword is lime? Sword is lime. Okay. And what about the key? Uh... No key. There's no key? No. Why is there no key? He's carrying the key on his back. Look. So, if he's carrying the key on his back, does that mean that the key is on his back? It's on the back of the tombstone. Scarlett. No. I need to have a look behind here. Scarlett, no! Come on! I need you to help me. Okay! Shit! Be careful. Let me... I need to see the back. Okay. I can't... Watch your foot. We're gonna have to put it down because I can't see. Shit. There's nothing there. I can see that. Ammonia sulfonate, distilled, with lime. It's the mix of a couple of basic cleaning products. Help me out here, man. BENJI: What are you doing? Okay. You don't want to breathe this in. BENJI: This is not gonna end well. It's on the back. They will never see it. GEORGE: Oh, my God. And I need some matches. Matches? No. No. BENJI: We're not burning that. Benji, give me your matches. Scarlett, this is a museum! Are you out of your... Shut up! Shit! GEORGE: Oh, my God! This is not okay! BENJI: Wow! GEORGE: Okay, that's pretty cool. That's not "go to jail" cool. But that's really cool. Wow. Get your camera. "Winged vulture leads the way "with brightest light in darkest day. "Underneath the heaven's reign "what is lost shall be regained. "Halfway twixt the darkest gate "and this tablet laid atop a pairèd fate." So, "Underneath the heaven's reign, "what is lost shall be regained." "What is lost shall be regained." So that is, underneath the night sky or in the open? Or on the tablet. There's a night sky right on the tablet. Yes, good. Okay. So, darkest gate. Hell. Hell. Darkest gate, the gates of Hell. The gates of Hell. Right? Yeah. The gates of Hell. Okay, but that doesn't give us anything. I mean, that's halfway between this grave and the gates of Hell. No, wait. I have my dad's notebook. Oh, my God. Okay. So this marks what they believe to be the distance between Heaven and Earth and Hell. If alchemists believed that the number of the Devil was 741 then it makes sense that they would think that Hell was 741 feet beneath the surface of the Earth, right? So halfway twixt... So, 370.5 feet beneath Flamel's tombstone is where we'll find the stone! BENJI: Wait. Hold on, guys. How are we supposed to get 370 feet into the Earth? The catacombs. Right? BENJI: The what? Okay, we're in Paris, so there are over 200 miles of tunnels right underneath our feet. That are holding the remains of six million corpses. BENJI: Whoa, whoa. Six million corpses? Yeah. That's where I would put it! Right. Of course you would. Flamel's grave was here. With the catacomb map, would make it roughly... There. Shit. Wait. Are you sure? BENJI: What is it? What happened? Shit! Catacombs don't go under Flamel's grave. But if we burrowed through this wall here... No, you can't. In this tunnel... The walls are solid limestone. There's no way you can burrow in. Plus, they've all been reinforced since pieces of the city fell into the... Well then... Wait a minute, wait a minute. In 1774, about a hundred feet of Avenue Denfert-Rochereau was literally swallowed up into the ground by the city. A couple of years later, the same thing happened... Barrière d'Enfer, right there. Followed by a third collapse. Rue des Innocents. BENJI: Why would the street collapse if there's nothing but solid ground underneath it? That's a good question, Benji. So there's a hidden chamber? It would appear so. We have to get down there. You have to get down there. I don't go underground. Remember? Yes. Sorry. By the end of the 1700s, residents from all over Paris began to complain about the horrible smell of the bodies in the overcrowded cemetery. Something had to be done. Benji, get this. (SCARLETT READING) "Stop. This is the empire of the dead." Wait, check out the patterns and crosses that they made. It's beautiful. TOUR GUIDE: Six million bodies, almost three times the population of Paris are housed in these quarries. Making it, by far, the largest crypt in the world. BENJI: Seriously, Scarlett, this is creeping me out. (SCARLETT GIGGLES) Get this. (SCARLETT READING) "At the sound of the trumpet, the dead will rise." Benji, here. Cimetière des Innocents. These remains are from the same cemetery as the Flamel graves. Which means that... Yeah, we basically need to go about half a mile through this wall. We need to find a way into the off-limits area of the catacombs. MAN: Go to the club called Le Showcase. Sorry? Ask for Papillon. He'll bring you. BENJI: Papillon? TOUR GUIDE: Please! Thanks. Come back into the group. Please. Come on. Sorry. Are you sure this is where we're supposed to go? Yeah, I think it's... I think it's just down here. What's his name again? Papillon. Papillon? Yeah. Okay. (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING) Papillon? (SCARLETT SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) Yes, what do you want? I need to get into the catacombs and someone told me that you could take me. (LAUGHING) No, sorry. Do I look like a tour guide to you? Do I look like a tourist? Okay, why would I want to bring you down there? Because we have found a secret tunnel in the catacombs that no one else knows about. Look. No. I know that place. We would have found it if it was there. No, you wouldn't have. Yes, we would. No, you wouldn't have, because it was designed, years and years ago, to be invisible. Unless you knew it was there, you would never find it. Why would that be? Because I believe it's filled with treasure. You know what I mean? Treasure, yeah, I know what you mean. (LAUGHING) It's a joke. I mean, is she serious? I'm 100% serious. If it's true, me and my friends, can we take half of the treasure? You can have all of the treasure. It's not what I'm looking for. Half is fine. Okay. So you'll take us? Yes, I said okay. Try this. No, I'm sorry, I'm not going. No, he's coming. He's coming. I'm not coming. George, come on, please. I need your help. You can text me whatever you find down there. I'm gonna be around... No. You can't. No cell phones down there. The ground is too dense. (MAN CHEERING) We are so close. I know. You know there's something there. Guys, meet my team. This is Zed, our climber. And this is Souxie, the banshee. Hi. Ça va? Souxie, the banshee. (PAPILLON ARGUING IN FRENCH) Okay. Okay. Then we go near laplage. Okay. And then it's a bit tricky. PAPILLON: There's water to here. And we're prepared for that? We have enough equipment? Yeah, we got everything. BENJI: Zed, right? How do you know Papillon? Oh, I grew up with him. He's my friend, you know. Do you know how he got the scar on his hand? Don't talk about that to him. Souxie, what are the dangers that we're facing when we go down there? If you run out of batteries, with no flashlight, you will die. If you run out of water, if you get hurt. ZED: And there are also dangers like police and bats, rats, claustrophobia, drowning, bugs. Yeah. De Niro? You want to see De Niro? Yes, yes. PAPILLON: Don't do it. SOUXIE: No. He's bad. Let me do De Niro. Fuck, man. Fuck. Just like that! (LAUGHING) (BEAT PLAYING) (IMITATING BEAT) You're up. ZED: (SINGING) Hey,yo,hey,yo... Listen to that. No. And it's over. Do it like that. Three seconds. You suck. (ALL LAUGHING) Guys, when we leave the van, we need to be quick, okay? Because if the police catch us with all that stuff, we're fucked. Okay? BENJI: Okay. GEORGE: I'll walk you guys down there but then I'm out. PAPILLON: Quick, quick. SOUXIE: Go, go, go. PAPILLON: Okay, Souxie. Okay, make it quick, make it quick. Okay? PAPILLON: Okay, wait. PAPILLON: Zed? Yeah. (SOUXIE SPEAKING FRENCH) BENJI: Can we keep going? ZED: Congratulations. Okay. Okay. Now, we should put our headlamps on. Let's go. Okay? Can you check if mine is on? Where's yours? GEORGE: I'm not coming with you guys. I told you a bunch of times. PAPILLON: Okay. I'm leaving you guys in a second. SCARLETT: Just give it a minute. PAPILLON: Here we are. This is it. Where? There? There. GEORGE: That's the hole that you're going into? PAPILLON: Yeah. That's it? SOUXIE: It's not a joke. Okay. GEORGE: Wow. Let's do it. BENJI: All right. Look, before we go down there, I have installed pin-cams on some of your headlamps. Hold on. Camera B, good, check. All right. All right, camera C, check. Let's go. What's this? Good luck. Scarlett, I'm not... I shouldn't have even come this far. Please, I need you with me. I'm not. I'm sorry. SOUXIE: Okay? Are you sure you're not see what happens? I see you... following. What am I following? Who? Where am I going? Where you belong. I belong with Paris. I gave myself up. It didn't save him! You gave yourself up, but you didn't surrender, did you? Did you? Do you see him? No. Not yet. [Hecuba] I hear them playing. I can always tell that sweet laughter. [Chuckles] Little Hector. Do you see them? Yes, yes, yes. I see them. Are they all right? Yes, they're all right. When they grow up, they will make you so proud of them. So very, very proud. You gave me such beautiful children. Such beautiful children. [Humming] We are free, my friend. [Neck Snaps] [Taps Horse] [Men Gasping] Well done, cousin. [Men Grunting] [Footsteps Approaching] Spare my queen. [Gasps, Groans] [Screaming] [Sobbing, Screaming] [Screaming Continues] Bring her. My lord, this way. As I said, no trade. [Screams] No! [Helen Screaming] [Grunting] [Helen] No! No! No! [Crying] Leave her! [Crying Continues] [Grunting] [No Audible Dialogue] [Baby Crying] [Chattering] [Woman Screaming] [Chattering Continues] [Woman Screaming] [Horse Neighing] Helen. What has he done? Go. Go quickly. Clytemnestra. I told you once. Never interfere! I come for Iphigenia. She's not here. I know. [Yelling] My daughter! [Yelling Continues] My daughter! [Baby Crying] [Women Screaming] [Soldiers Laughing] [Narrator] War is waged by nations, but it is human beings that pay the price. For those of us that survived, we are left with the memory... of shame and misery and bloodshed. The king is dead! In these dark times, the only thing we have left to hold on to is love, the one true gift of the gods. And it is through love... that we hope and pray... the gods will send us peace. - Paris. - Brave Helen. Wherever you are, take me with you. I cannot. Will we ever meet again? I've prepared your place. Good. Do you think I would kill you, Helen? I do not thank you for my life. I understand. I cannot love you. What will you do? [Sniffs] I will follow. I accept. [Man Narrating ] You may have heard the story of Helen, a woman whose beauty launched a thousand ships... and started the most famous war in history. You may have heard of that valiant struggle... that took place beneath the golden walls of Troy. Ten years, the best of our lives. Ten thousand men, the best the gods and dreams of glory could have fashioned. All led by my brother Agamemnon, the mightiest of the Greeks. And Achilles, who could strike down 10 warriors with one blow. You may even have heard of Paris, who they say betrayed his country and crown... for love. But that is not the way it happened. Let me tell you the real story. I know. I was there. [ Girl ] Kill him! kill him! [ Woman Groaning ] kill him! kill him! kill him! kill him! kill him! [ Baby Crying ] [ Woman ] It's a boy, Your Highness. A boy! [ Crying Continues ] You said, "kill him. kill him." Before any of us knew that it was a boy. Cassandra, have you just had one of your visions, hmm? tell me! Priam, come see your son. Cassandra, come see your brother Alexandros. Look, Cassandra, Cassandra... I know that you see things, and I know that people don't believe you, but I do. You-You saw that it was a baby boy, right? Hmm? What else did you see? [ Panting ] What else? If he lives, Troy will burn. [ Crying Continues ] Take my son to the mountain. No! Throw him from the highest peak. No! Do it now! No! No! No, no, no, no! No! No! Please! No! Please! My son! No! Gods, do your will. [ Baby Crying ] Why would they? What was it, child? Some foul prophet jealous of your beauty? Never mind. With me you shall be loved and honored. I shall name you... Paris. [Man ] Paris! Paris, where are you? Paris, come! Time to eat! [ Laughing ] [ Grunting ] - Ohhh! - [ Laughs ] I've got goats who fight better than you. Hey, too bad you can't watch your goats as well as your flank. Look! What? - [ Goat Bleating ] - Watch my herd! Stubos! [ Bleating ] [ Bell Clanking ] Stubos! [ Bell Ringing ] [ Goat Bleating] Stubos? [ Water Flowing] Stubos? [ Sighs ] [ Indistinct Whispering] Who's there? Beauty is all; all is beauty. Victory goes to the strong. Gold rules men. Wealth is power. Paris must choose. You must judge who of us is fairest. Who are you? Choose me, Paris. I am Hera. I can give you wealth beyond your dreams. Athena brings victory and glory forever. Look into its face, Paris. See what Aphrodite gives. The most beautiful woman in the world-- Helen. [ Horse Whinnies ] [ Horse Whinnies ] - Pollux! - You know you can't go outside the city walls. Father is furious. Come on. Let's get you bathed and dressed. You can't go to a wedding looking like that. That big one in front. Is that Agamem-- the one who's to marry our sister? No. That's his father, King Atreus. See that one there with the beard? That's Agamemnon. They say that one day he will rule the entire Aegean. Now come on. Let's go. Who's the other one, the young one? [ Pollux ] That's his brother, Menelaus. Younger by two years. And not too fond ofliving in his brother's shadow, so I hear. Com e on. Let's get you dressed. Where are they from? Mycenae. Where's that? Never you mind. Theseus, my king, this is bad timing, don't you think? The greater the challenge. Don't get me wrong. I love a challenge. But I just hate to be missing Athens in the springtime. You know how beautiful that is. If you want beauty, you'll find it right here beyond those walls. The most beautiful girl in the world is here in Sparta. She's just a child! I'll ripen her like grapes. I'll age her like wine. When she ages just enough, I'll taste her. Well and fine, but not when the greatest warriors in Mycenae are just behind those walls. Don't be such a bore. Let's have some fun. Fun? This is not fun. Fishing is fun. Playing the lute is fun. Swimming in shark-infested waters is fun. Committing suicide is not fun! [ Blowing Horn ] High King Atreus, Prince Agamemnon, Prince Menelaus. We welcome you to Sparta. Great Tyndareus, made greater by his kindness. Made greater only by his most dutiful and obedient daughter. May I present the lovely Clytem nestra. Clytem nestra... I hereby claim you as my wife. And who is this? My youngest. Still a child. An untamed and disrespectful child, I might add. Her name, my lord? She is Helen. Helen. Father, I will take her to her room. Yes, indeed you shall. As punishment for her disrespect, she will miss the wedding feast. Father-In-Law, I see my bride is distressed. You're quite right. Clytemnestra's little sister is but a child-- a child who meant no harm. Why not invite her to join us? Well, that sounds fair. I would be honored to be Helen's escort, should the king's legendary kindness permit. Pollux, see that she's properly dressed. Yes, Father. Have you ever seen anything like it? So much trouble. [Helen ] What's all the fuss about? Don't you understand anything about anything? You're not a little girl. You're-- You're almost a woman. What are you doing? I'm no such thing. You are. Listen. Listen to me. Get off for a second. Listen! No! I won't! Helen! Helen, I love you more than life. I know it's hard to accept, but someday soon you will marry. I already know who to. You do? I saw him. Where? In the water. You'll marry a fish? A shepherd. Oh, that's likely. Helen! I will. I will, Pollux. I had a vision. I saw his face and-- And what? He saw mine. And one day he'll find me. I know it. I just- - I know it. [ Laughs ] Good. Good. Meanwhile, you must be ready for kings and princes to seek your hand. Why? Your beauty, your spirit. It makes men weak. Helen, you have no idea what madness lies in men. All men, every one. Even you? [MiddleEastern] There she is. Ah, yes, I see her. [ Woman Laughing] [ Chattering ] [ Gasps, Screams ] [ Muffled Screaming ] - Halt there! - Would you hold this, please? Thank you. [ Grunting ] [ Screaming Continues ] [Helen ] Whyareyou doing that? Doing what? Casting lots. And I know what for too. You've no right. I'm not some sort of a prize-- Well done, my friend. So you get the gi rl, and I get the horse. Well, I'll just have to find meself another stunningly beautiful princess. - Persephone, perhaps. - She's sweet on pomegranates, I heard. I hate pomegranates. Farewell, my friend. May the gods be kind. Who are you? Theseus, King of Athens. You don't look like a king. [ Spits ] You'd better get used to me. I'm going to marry you. I think you've got me confused with my sister. I'm not the daughter of Tyndareus who does what anybody says. You're not the daughter of Tyndareus at all. Of course I am. You think my mother found me under a cabbage leaf? Some say that. I don't. You're Queen Leda's daughter, all right. There's no mistaking that face. I'm my father's daughter too. [ Laughs ] You'd have to be. That's the way it works. Tyndareus is my father. They never told you anything at all, did they? Told me what? What do you think happened to your mother? She died. Why? Because of me. I made her sick. How? Do you know? Tyndareus told you you killed your mother? He didn't have to say it. He can't look at me. [ Sighs ] Your mother took her own life, Helen. She leapt from the west wall of the palace. No. You lie. Why would she? She was raped. Because she was beautiful? Yeah. [ Helen Screams ] Is that what you intend with me? What? Rape. I don't rape children. Or are you a woman? No. No. No. Well, when you are, we'll be good friends. You will be fine. [Distant Shouting] You can't take away our best stock. You should be honored. Honored? That you steal away our livelihood? [ Woman Shouting, Indistinct ] You'll be com pensated. Fairly. Fairly com pensated. Com pensated doesn't fill our cows with seed. Com pensation doesn't give us meat! [ Man ] Paris, where are you? Paris! They're taking your bull! - That's the property of the king ofTroy! - No, he's not! He's mine! I raised him! Hold it! - [ Grunting ] - Leave him! Leave my son alone! [ Grunting, Groans ] [ Mooning ] Any other objections? [ Groaning Continues ] He will be the grand prize in King Priam's games. If you wish to negotiate with the winner, you will find him there. [ Helen ] Tell me the truth about my mother. I need to know. Please. [ Sighs ] When it happened, Tyndareus was away in Egypt. When she began to show a couple of months later, he'd been gone for half a year. So the kingdom watched her belly swell month after month. She was disgraced. She had no husband beside her. She waited till she had you, then-- Had me? [ Shuddering ] It was me? No! Helen, no! There are wolves! [ Sighs, Panting ] Do I look like her? Well, you're younger... and dirtier. When you grow up, if you grow up and don't make me wring your neck, you'll be even more breathtaking. Who was it? Who did it? Tell me who. Helen, you're the daughter of the greatest god. Zeus is your father. That's why your beauty will never be matched. That's why no man will ever resist it. You resisted me. Well... [ Laughs ] not without great effort. Let me be your friend. I think you could do with one. I must always know the truth. Always. [Paris ] I'm going to Troy. I'll get our bull back. [ Father] Troy is no place for people like us. I'm going. No. They'll hurt you. I f these ri bs a ren't broken, they will be with one more blow. They can't treat us like that, like we're nothing. I'll bring back what's ours. There's no point. There is... when I win it. [ Chattering ] [ Narrator ] And so Paris came to Troy. It was the richest city in the world. Into it were brought silks from Asia, spices from Arabia, rare woods from Africa. [ Chicken Clucking ] [ Speaking Asian Language ] A feast for the eyes. Both of them. Huh? [ Chattering Continues ] [ Narrator] From its strategic harbor, with its massive walls, Troy controlled all trade north and south ofthe Aegean. And Paris would control Troy's fate... more than he could know. [ Horse Whinnying ] [ Bull Mooing ] [ Mooing Continues ] [ Applause, Cheering ] [ Chattering ] [ Cheering Continues ] [ Crowd Chanting ] Hector! Hector! Hector! Hector! You here to sign up? What's your name? Paris. Of? As in where from? [ Applause ] Mount Ida. All right. Where's your cuirass? - My what? - Breastplate. No? What about a helmet? Any kind of armor? Boy! Fetch me some of that old armor. How about your cudgel? I could use this. Look here, lad, you can't win, but at least you have to put on a good show. Go ahead, choose one. You'll find some better than others. Why can't I win? No one ever beats Prince Hector. [Applause, Cheering] Leave your knife on the rack. Hey, shepherd boy! The hero from Mt. Ida! [ Laughing ] Ah, the king's thief. You're on, shepherd. With your friend. Go! Go, go! Paris of Mt. Ida meets Pres Byterian, commander ofthe guard! [ Cheering, Booing ] [ Booing, Jeering ] [ Both Grunting ] [ Grunting ] [ Cheering ] [Announcer] The winner is Paris of Mt. Ida. [ Groaning ] Need better armor. This old Hittite stuffisjunk. Is it bad? It's nothing. An old wound. You shouldn't be fighting. I have to. Oh, really? And why is that? I don't like thieves sent by kings... to steal my livestock for their games and amusement. The bull? My bull. Ah. [ Laughing ] [ Crowd Cheering] My father's games must be fair. I can't fight a wounded man. The rules are clear, my lord. You must. Paris. Son. [ Groaning ] Paris of Mt. Ida will fight Damien of Argos. You're hurt. I'll be fine. Your ribs. You can't. Father, I'll be fine. [ Crowd Cheering] [ Announcer ] The winner is Paris of Mt. Ida! [ Crowd Cheering] [ Announcer Continues ] Paris, you must stop this. I've seen these crush a man's head. [ Gasps ] Paris, you must never mind what happened. We'll survive without our bull. Paris, you're my only child. I beg you, come home. [ Panting ] You raised me to be strong, to be loyal, to defend what I believe in. [Announcer] Paris of Mt. Ida... will fight Hideus of Seronea. I love you, Father. [Announcer] The winner: Paris of Mt. Ida! I can't watch my only son get killed. He's not your son. Begone, old shepherd. Wait. He's my father. No, Paris, don't. It's Princess Cassandra. Alexandros. My name is Paris. You should be dead. Give me a minute. [ Announcer ] The final match! Prince Hector of Troy... against Paris of Mt. Ida! No! [ Whispering ] You must kill him. These are just games, Cassandra. You don't understand! Look, he is good, but he's only a shepherd. He's Alexandros. He's baby Alexandros! If you love your family, honor Troy, you must destroy him. You don't intend to fight me? I'll fight you the way I live, not Troy's way. Do you know how to use a dagger, shepherd? Can't stop wolves with sticks. What is he doing? Then use it. [ Crowd Murmuring ] [ Both Grunting ] [ Grunting Continues ] - Kill him! - What? [ Yelling ] Come on! [ Cassandra ] Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Alexandros? [ Screaming ] Kill him! Do you surrender? I am prepared to die. I don't want your life! Does Prince Hector surrender? Does Troy surrender? The winner: Paris of Mt. Ida! [ Crowd Cheering] Approach, Paris of Mt. Ida. Don't look at him, Mother. Alexandros? Are you Alexandros? My name is Paris. Father, what are you doing? We have our bull. We can go home. You are home. Noble King Priam, if someone must be punished, let it be me. My son? There is no doubt, my queen. I found him on the mountain. [ Sobs ] My darling, darling child. Shepherd... you've done well. You have brought home our son. Welcome home... Prince Paris ofTroy! [ Cheering, Applause ] The prophecy has been fulfilled. What prophecy? Because you live, we all must die. [ Horse Nickers ] How was the ride? Ohh. Mount Hymettus honey. Best i n the world. How do you know it's the best? Well, I suppose I don't. Well, then there's always a chance... you might find something better. No. I want to love. Well, you will someday. I'm ready now. You're young. I'm a woman. Someday, someplace you'll find someone better. Someone worthier. When you do, neither the gods' will nor the earth's turning... will keep you from him. That's how I feel about you. But, Helen, this has just been-- well, a kind of practice. Someday you'll know the difference. You always said that we'd marry. Helen. Hey. [ Gasps ] Pollux! Shh. Quiet. Why are you here? We finally found you. You're safe now. [ Murmuring ] [ Shouting ] [ Gasps ] Aah! [ Grunting ] Leave him! Let me go! Let me go! Pollux, make them stop! Get her out of here! Don't let her see this! It will warm her heart! No, Pollux! You don't understand! Get off me! [ Grunts ] Aah! [ Grunting Continues ] Pollux, if you love me, hear me! Let me go! No! It's all right, Helen! I t's a fai r price, and I gladly pay it. - [ Groans ] - No! [ Whimpering ] No! - [ Grunts ] - Pollux! - No! - [ Helen Screaming ] [ No Audio ] [ Narrator] With the death of Pollux, Tyndareus had no heir. The great kings of the Aegean... were drawn to Sparta like moths to the flame. Odysseus, king of Ithaca, remembers the fallen Pollux... and offers his heart to the great king Tyndareus. Achilles brings greetings from the Myrmidons... who stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Sparta... to defend the honor of Sparta... and to revenge the blood of the great king Tyndareus. To die for a woman-- it's hard to imagine such weakness. You cannot comment. You have not seen her. - I don't need to. - [ Scoffs ] - You afraid to try? - I'm afraid of nothing. There. You shed no tears. By your actions, you have left me without love or hope... and Sparta without its future king, and you show no grief. [ Tyndareus ] It should have been you who died. Is there any among you who will take this cursed woman? Is there any among you... who wishes their home devastated, his country brought to ruin, his heart broken beyond repair? I leave her to you. Leave her! Tyndareus is right. She'll bring her husband more trouble than he could ever imagine. [ Odysseus ] The path to her bed is strewn with ash and death. And yet is there not one man 'round this table who does not want her? Do you suggest that every king here draw his sword against the other? No. Of course not. That would be-- What he wants is to have her all to himself. Isn't that right, little brother? [ Kings Laughing] In truth, if we raise our swords at all, it should be together and pointed in the same direction. Toward riches in Byzantium. Or Perseus. If we unite, we can conquer anything at all. Any creature, any nation. Well spoken, Agamemnon, but you control no army. Perhaps I should tellyou, brothers, that as we speak... our father, the clear-eyed Atreus, lies alone, speaking only with the gods. In a matter of days they will take him, and I will return to the citadel at Mycenae. [Achilles ] Then let us greet you now as our new high king-- mighty Agamem non of Mycenae. Agamem non! [ All ] Agamem non! Can we agree to unite in time of war? What do you say, Odysseus? I have a family. I'd rather plow a field and sow it with salt than go to war. [ Sighs ] And you, Achilles? Some of us may prefer a long and quiet life at home. I, for one, would live it short... if I knew I could die with a taste of glory on my lips. You will have it short if one of us takes Helen. [ Scoffs, Chuckles ] And yet, perhaps this is the way that we can unite as Agamemnon wishes. Good Odysseus, the wisest of us all. [ Scoffs ] Tell us, a wise one, what do you propose? Two things. First, we swear an oath. What sort of oath? Whoever takes Helen... can trust that we will defend that man's sole right to her with our lives. The rest must be content to admire her from afar. And second? We cast lots. The winner takes the bride. Never! Who-- What gives you the right to agree on such a thing? The right of one man to one vote. Who in the world has ever heard of that? There is no such thing. Then we begin here. Who swears the oath? Agamemnon, as we two are the only ones who are married, how do you suggest we cast the lots? Given this noble assem blage, I would say our seals. Closest to the jar... may claim his bride. Menelaus. What sayyou, my brother? I say the gods have spoken. And each man here would be wise to keep his oath... or face the everlasting wrath of Mount Olympus. [ Giggling ] Your daughter is so lovely. [ Chuckles ] She reminds me of you. [ Giggling Continues ] So long ago. I phigenia, come. Say good night to your aunt. Have you been bouncing? Ohh! Give your aunt a kiss. [ Chuckles ] Go to bed. Quickly. Making a child so sweet might be reason enough to live. You have many reasons, Helen. Tomorrow you will marry my husband's brother. We'll be sisters and sisters-in-law both. Yes. They are hard men. But it is possible to love them. Paris? Father asked to see you. Hmph. He's sending you to Sparta. Why? Because he wants you to take a message to the new king Menelaus, younger brother of High King Agamemnon of Mycenae. High king? Some sort of supreme ruler, is he? That's right. And now he's talking more against Troy. Why? Because we control access to the silks and spices of Byzantium. [ Scoffs ] What? I just can't believe people go to war over nutmeg. Well, they do, Paris, and you'd better get used to it. Where is he now, this high king of theirs? Don't know. Agamemnon's in Sparta for the funeral of Tyndareus and the crowning of Menelaus, and when I get there it will appear that I've been sent to drive a wedge... between the brothers, who will then kill me and put my head on a spike. Then Troy will be rid of me, Cassandra will be redeemed... and you can get back to being the sole heir to the throne. Am I close? You're being a fool. Look me in the eye and say that. Look me in the eye. Brother, if the gods have divined it, so be it. [ Winds Whistling ] Such strong winds, my lord. The gods must have hurried us here. Yes, it would seem. They must favor your mission. I wouldn't count on it. Oh. Helen, I'm the obedient wife, but even I will tellyou... he's taken this oath too far. When you were a child and Father punishedyou, you woul d always com e back fi ghti ng. Why aren't you fighting now? I've caused such grief and destruction. Helen, you did not ask to be kidnapped. Nor rescued, for that matter. It's not your fault. [ Whispers ] It's Paris ofTroy. Bring him here. You don't know. Why do you have to do this? Menelaus commands it. I don't do it for Agamemnon. Ten thousand men have sworn their lives... to defend the right of Menelaus to have me. Agamemnon believes the king... should seek proof of my worth. How can you let them treat you like this? They can look all they want, but they'll never see me. [ Crowd Chattering, Murmuring ] [ Men Shouting Approval ] Truly magnificent. Breathtaking. [ Murmuring, Shouting Continue ] - [ Grunting ] - Wait! Wait! Wait! We come in peace! I'll be fine. He seeks peace, my brother. There is no peace with Troy. He bears a letter from their king. To whom is it addressed? [ Crowd Murmuring ] Do not shame me, brother. Troy seeks to align with Sparta... and Sparta alone. They have sent him to drive a wedge between us. We can let nothing divide the blood of the house of Atreus. But not now. Not here. Let him remain, freely speaking... until we know enough ofTroy to find a way inside its golden walls. The weight of a crown has made my little brother wise beyond my expectations. [ Laughing, Chattering Resume ] [ Sniffling ] [ Winds Whistling ] Catch me, Theseus. Catch me, Pollux. [ Gasps ] You. I've seen you. In the pool. You saw too. I've come for you. It's too late. The gods decree it. Aphrodite herself. [ Helen ] Then the gods torment me. How can you say that? When I 'm there with them, I feel nothing. Naked i n front of a hundred kings-- nothing. But then tonight, when I saw you, something began to tear away my shield, to expose the one thing that I cannot endure. Hope. [ Sighs ] Have it now. I love you. [ Gasps, Sobs ] Loving me kills people. It destroys families, causes such grief you cannot imagine. I've imagined you all these years. And now I've found you, I cannot let you go. I will never leave you. The day I do is the day I die. Go away. Leave me. You must never see me again. [ Groans ] You consort with a Trojan, an enemy of Sparta. Do you want to be put to death? Yes, I do! [ Trembling ] What's happened to you? I've become visible. You're not making sense about anything. You meet some envoy, and before you-- No! I didn't just meet him. I've loved him foryears, before you even married Agamemnon. That can't be possible. It's not true, is it? What's going to happen? I heard Agamemnon and Menelaus talk of Troy. And? Tomorrow they will ask the envoy about his city. When Agamemnon has learned all he needs to know, we will return to Mycenae and Menelaus-- Will kill him. You did well tonight. The kings were pleased. Until the envoy arrived. Yes. Why is he here? That makes no matter. Did he come bearing tribute? There is no tribute that compares with you. You are a generous man. No, I'm a lucky man. [ Giggling ] [Paris ] You mean stealing's not a crime in Sparta? [ Menelaus ] Being caught is the crime, always. There was a boy-- young, no more than 1 0. He stole a fox and hid it under his cloak. He died while being questioned, and when they removed his cloak... they found he'd let the fox gnaw through his body rather than reveal his theft. Such boys make good soldiers. Yes, they do. We train them from the age of seven. Ours learn to tame horses from a young age. You must visit our stables whilst you are here. They're not as grand as your own, I'm sure. I have heard people say... that the walls ofTroy are made ofgold. Is this really true? No. But they are beautiful. [ Clytem nestra ] I phigenia, where are you? Perhaps one day I wi I I see the walls oft roy for myself. [ Gasps ] Ah! I found you! [ Giggling ] No man can possess all he desires. Calchas! My lord? My wife tells me... that no man can claim the world. What say the gods? Olympus favors the high king... who one day will rule the entire Aegean. You may bear my children, but never again will you interfere with my affairs. Is that understood? - [ Grunting ] - Come with me! You! And you! Let's go! [ Woman Screaming ] Quiet! Let's go! I thought we were here to make peace. We like making peace. Yes. A lot. The Greeks have other ideas. What sort of ideas? Like cut off our heads, put them on pikes, let birds eat our eyes. That sort of thing. Prince Paris of Troy, my king bids you a fond good night. [ Grunting ] Aah! [ Groaning ] Man those oars! Get to the turret! Go now. You're free. Without you? You have my love. Without you I have nothing. My lord! My lord! The tide begins to turn! Menelaus is shamed, but he fears to harm me. Now go. I beg you! Please go! My lord! The wi nd is up! Please. Please. Make way, men! [ Crewmen Shouting, Chattering] [ Crewman ] Ready oars! Ready? Pull! Ready? Pull! Ready? Pul I! No. [ Crewman ] Hold oars! Make way! What have we done? [ Crowd Shouting, Cheering ] [ Crowd ] Ohh! [ Crowd Cheering, Whistling ] Wel I fought, Croesus. [ Crowd Chanting ] Achilles! Achilles! [ Chanting Continues ] Your news precedes you. As the gods are my witness, I will kill that man. You can be sure of it. You brought dishonor on yourself and shame to the house of Atreus. I'll have the Trojan's head on a spike! Not without my help. Ah, yes. Well, as always, I must bear the weight of your shadow. You're a smudge on history's ledger, Menelaus, but you are my brother. What's more, the kings of the Aegean have sworn an oath. To unite, as I recall. The oath did not place you in command of me, of my army, or any other-- Do not incur my wrath, little brother. Do not. These are my terms. You may have the Trojan... and your whore. I will take Troy. You will share no spoils-- not a scrap of broken clay, not an ingot of their basest metal. Agreed? I am your brother-- Do you agree? [ Crowd Quiets ] What makes you think the kings will unite behind you? The gods have written it. And you know for certain they favor you in this? For certain! [ Crewmen Shouting ] Save him! Swim, Clemyetus! Throw me the line! Reach for me! Aah! [ Screaming ] [ Sighs ] Two months. The wind remains against us. The men grow impatient! I grow impatient, Achilles. Calchas. My lord. When will the winds blow with us? What say the gods? Speak, seer. What must I do? A terrible thing. Tell me. I command you. The goddess Artemis asks foryour daughter. In trade for fair wind, Artemis demands your daughter's life... here, on this altar. And this... will satisfy the goddess? But you must hold the knife. The gods demand it. Of course they do. The winds will soon be with us. Pitch! Oh! [ Giggles ] Okay, ready? Ready? [ Laughing ] [ Continues Giggling, Laughing ] Mustwe leave now that the ship's repaired? The men have asked-- I understand. I know. They have wives, families. You know, we could stay here, just the two of us. I promise you I'll make a far better shepherd than I do a prince. My lord! Manyships! We have to warn Troy. You must go now. We must go now. You can't give Agamemnon an excuse for war. Agamemnon wants Troy. He's always wanted Troy. That's why my father sent me to Sparta. And now, wherever this path may lead, we're on it together. [ People Chattering ] This way. Hector. The elders demand to see you. Alone. - Do not harm her. - I'll be all right. It is you who brings harm to Troy. Men, thank you. Go home. You steal the king of Sparta's wife? And you bring her here... with the entire Aegean fleet on your heels, and you expect us to turn a blind eye to your wanton frolics? Father, please allow me to present my case. You have presented us with a war! That is case enough. Agamem non presents war, not I. You sent me to Sparta to confirm it, my king. Elders of Troy, the high king of Mycean has fastened himself to Troy... as gateway to the treasures of Byzantium. The woman belongs to Sparta. Where she's treated worse than a Hittite whore? Forced to walk naked among Aegean kings who leer... and spiTobscenities. I did not take her. isaved her from a people who find no worth in women, place no value on beauty... and seek their only honor through glorious death in battle. Father, do not listen. The woman brings the end of Troy. [ Whispering] She must be returned to Sparta. - Where is Helen? - She's being prepared. - For what? - Her husband. Does Troy so fear the Aegeans it turns its face from mercy? Are the gilded walls of I lium so weak... they cannot defend kindness and compassion? Are you all blind? The woman is a Spartan. She must leave here. She must go. She will kill us all. Good King, your daughter speaks the truth. I have no right to be here. Helen. I wish to return to my husband. [Man ] Row! Row! Your wife awaits you. Menelaus, king of Sparta! Odysseus, king of Ithaca! Troy welcomes you. Great King Priam, we are... honored to stand before you. We know you to be just... and wise, and therefore will see reason... to return to Sparta... what belongs to Sparta. For what purpose? Purpose? You ask us to return to Sparta that which belongs to Sparta. is this your property, your chattel or your evening's amusement? Will you insult me? I demand you return my wife! Bold King of Sparta, I ask the question again. - For what purpose? - Because she is mine! Because she is my wife! It is a simple question. And I will make it painfully simple if only for your benefit. You will return Helen... to me... or the com bined arm ies of the Aegean will sack your city... and raze it to the ground! Good King Priam, ifl may speak on the matter. A man loses his wife to another. Perhaps she's stolen. Perhaps she goes ofher own free will. It makes no difference. That man is so consumed... with griefand passion, he becomes rash, even senseless at ti mes. It would be the same for any man here-- the farmer in the field, the merchant in the street, even a king. King Menelaus pleads with you to return his wife. For what purpose, you ask. For the only purpose that can account for such fervor. Love. Only that. King Odysseus, you've spoken Well and wisely. You shall have our answer... before sunrise. Leave us. I asked to be returned. is that what you want? It is my duty. I have two questions. Do you love my son? With all my heart. If isend you back, will it stop this war? Why not? - I know him. - Menelaus? The other. Bring me Achilles. The main fleet lands here, Agamemnon and I here. We scale the cliffs to a plain that leads to the marketplace below the city. Up a staircase, through an arch in frontof the city gates. The moment we attack, the merchants will retreat to the city. And the weakness of com passion will keep the gates open. Menelaus, take the beach. We will pass through the market in disguise. A short life full of glory. Isn't that what you wished? May the gods smile on our destiny. [ Priam ] I agree with the elders, who have no doubt that the high king of Mycenae comes to Troy... for the purpose of making war. We are al so aware of specul ati on that he has sacrificed his daughter... for the purpose of securing a favorable wind. This is not the conduct of a man of peace. We also agree that to sacrifice your honor, or even your I ife, will not appease his desire... or make peace more likely. For these reasons, we invite you to consider this city to be your home... for as long as you shall live. Furthermore, should you choose to renounce... any further affiliation with Sparta, you shall henceforth be known... as Helen of Troy. Do you accept this offer? I accept. [ Squawking ] It appears they will keep her. To Troy! [ Men Cheering ] [ All Shouting ] [ Man ] Move ahead! [ Grunting ] [ Shouts ] We need to move the barriers now! Drop and hold now! [ Panicked Chattering ] On to Troy! [ Screams ] [ Woman ] There is no time. Move away! Soldiers! Alert the guards. You brought all this upon us, Paris. You and your golden Aphrodite! [ Man ] They're coming! Onward! [ All Shouting ] Fall before Achilles! Archers! Fire! [Shouting, Sword Clashing Stops ] I fear for Agamemnon! He should be here by now! Spartans! Follow me! Bring armors! Ten of your best men. [ Ferocious Yell ] Back to Troy! - [ Screams ] - Agamemnon! Unfortunate. Paris! Thank you, brother. Retreat from the archers! Head them off! Now! Fall back! There! [ Groans ] Quickly! Close the gates! Well done, my boy. Thank you, Father. I owe you my life. We are blood. What say you now, sister? Will Troy still burn? Don't ask a question if you don't want an answer. Well, Cassandra, is there an answer? For 10 years, the Greeks will pillage our country, attack our gates. For 10 years, they will raid the southern shores, enslave our neighbors, fatten themselves on their butchered cattle, become rich with spoils. And our friends will flee here and flee here, flee here... until these walls are packed with broken people... a nd ou r city is fi I I ed with sorrow, ou r streets fl ooded with tears, until there will not be one of us... with food to eat, water to drink or air to breathe! - Cassandra! Enough! - The war will not be over until the curse is lifted. You all know it. Why can you not understand? Why do you not believe? Because, child, we must not believe you. We cannot bel ieve you. - Paris m ust die. - [ Hector] Stop her, Father! I cannot stop. I will not stop until you listen! Cassandra, please. You don't know what you're saying. isay the truth, only the truth! But none of you have seen... what I see. [ Gasping ] - She's mad. - [ Screaming ] Enough! This family, this city speaks with one voice! There will be no dissent. Guard! Take her away. Put her in the dungeon. [ Screaming Continues ] A creature will come, a creature that eats men! He will eat you, Father! And you! and you! and you! He will eat all of you! [Screaming] You all will die! [ Screaming] [ Narrator] And so 10 years passed beneath the walls of Troy. A t home our own cities crumbled into ruin. The men had lost all their dreams. They'd forgotten what their own wives looked like. But I could not forget, and Agamemnon wou I d not forget, and so we stayed... and stayed. Well, I'm glad that there is laughter in here. Really. There is none outside in the camp. The men want to go home. Menelaus is right. My wife has suitors breaking down the door. Her weaving ruse will only last so long. [ Laughter] And 10 years is too long. We must finish this war... or go home. So we shall. [ Menelaus ] So we shall what? Fight... or retreat? Both. When the outcome of Troy is determined, I wish to know it. You seem sad. What? A message. Agamemnon proposes peace. At what price? [Agamemnon ] This war has gone on too long. I propose... we negotiate an end to it. On what terms? Paris fights Menelaus. Single com bat. Whoever wins... claims Helen. Helen belongs to Troy. No matter who wins, we will leave. if you speak for Menelaus, it's you ishould fight. My brother? I challenge you, Paris, to the death... for my wife! And for my honor. - Your weapon? - Javelin. I accept. These belonged to Atreus. It is he you avenge today. Can you envision a future... where some feckless Trojan... leaps up onto the tomb of the great Menelaus... and proudly recounts this day? Can you see that day, my brother? Can you even imagine it? [ Cheering, Shouting ] [ Cheering Grows Louder ] [ Cheering ] [ Cheering ] Oh. Aah. [ Cheering ] [ Cheering ] [ Panting ] [ Sniffing ] [ Cheering ] [ Ferocious Yell ] [ Yells, Grunts ] [Jug Shatters ] [ Men Cheering ] Revenge the house of Atreus! Die, Trojan. Die! [ Menelaus Grunts ] [ Gagging ] [ Gasping, Panting ] [ Coughing ] [ Panting, Grunting ] The gods must be on your side. [ Panting ] I could have told you that. [ Sniffs ] I know this substance. How long have I got? The Thracians use it to hunt monkeys. It's not lethal, just-- Unfair. iswear I did not know. Tell me something. Do you-- Do you honestly believe that you deserve her more than I do? Yes. Yes, I do. We took an oath. I am ashamed, the way we-- the way I treated her. Somehow, I feel... you're not much like your brother. Something you might have noticed in Sparta before you abused my hospitality. Before you had me killed, you mean. I might have let you go. Probably not. Is she well? Yes. Does she ever-- Has she spoken of me? Now I must ask you something. [ Sighs ] Agamemnon wants Troy, not Helen. Yes. Then why are we trying to kill each other? His amusement. Have you ever thought some day you should defy him? Can you walk? I think so. [Man ] There's Menelaus! [ Cheering ] You're alive! A misunderstanding. [Man Shouts ] Paris lives! [ Cheering ] [ Man ] All hail Prince Paris! They will fight again tomorrow. No. We will settle this today. I will take the place of my brother. Hector! I challenge you, High King Agamemnon! But this time without poison! You do not stand for me. I cannot allow you to fight for me. I stand for Troy. - I fight for my country! - Not my firstborn. [ Crowd Cheering ] Hector, it is for me to end it with Agamemnon. It is my path to follow. You are my mortal brother, and I am proud to share your journey. Hector, my boy! Come back within these wal ls, I beg you. I stand for High King Agamemnon. I've skewered nothing but rabble for the last 10 years. I'm sick of it! I thirst for royal blood. Mighty Achilles! Helen is not your fight. I do not fight for Helen. [ Paris ] Then for what? Something a Trojan could never understand. Achilles fights for his own hollow pride! He honors nothing but his own image in the glass! He hungers only for glory. if you do not feed him, he will starve! [ Priam ] Hector, my boy, pityyour mother's misery... and mine. I beg you, do not hand over your glory and your own sweet life... to such a brutal, war-loving dog! You throw first. - We should draw lots. - No. Go ahead. Take it. I'm waiting. You should have hit me when you had the chance. - I don't fight that way! - I do! - No! - [ Hecuba Screams ] No. [ Screams ] Achilles! Take me! Die, Hector! [ Hector Groaning ] [ Sobbing ] [ Soldiers Cheering ] [ Cheering Continues ] [ Grunting ] Today I feed your son to my dogs! [ Sobbing ] Tomorrow they will devour your Prince Paris! [ indistinct Shout ] Hyah! [ Sobbing Continues ] [ Prisoners Wailing ] [ Cell Door Slams ] - Cassandra? - Leave me! Paris believes Aphrodite protects him. Can you see-- You bring ruin to my house, kill my family, destroy my world, and you expect me to soothe your worries! How dare you! [ Spits ] [ Panting ] - My brother is dead. - Yes. It wasn't a question. Then you must know why I'm here. I will do anything to save him. Anything. Tell me what to do. - See me. - I do. See me. See me! Achilles dies. The war begins again. Ajax dies. Odysseus is wounded, also Agamemnon. When the day's sun sets, only Menelaus will be left to lead. Paris won't die? Not today. - And if I-- - Give myself up? if you surrender to Agamemnon, the Aegeans will leave. - And Paris? - He will live. Wake Prince Paris, quickly! Sire, your lady has left the palace. Huh? [ Shouting, Chattering ] [ Horse Neighing ] Hyah! [ Horse Neighing ] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Brave Trojans, please. Ithankyou with all my heart. But this is a weight I must bear alone. High King of Mycenae, I come to end this war. Just like that? I will do your bidding. My bidding? A trade. The daughter of Zeus for the body of Hector. And you think that's enough? Do you think my daughter's death was for nothing? Hmm? Is that what you think? is that what you're saying? Can you even imagine the innocence in her eyes... as she reached out for her own father? He held her in his arms, raised her up. Poor little love. So full of trust. As if he somehow was capable of good. And then that startled look. Can you imagine? No. Then I will tell you. There is no trade. Not you, not Troy, not even my own life will balance the scales. Now, do you understand? Yes, I understand. Your rage destroys worlds, but it is yourself you hate. [Soldiers Cheering ] [ Soldiers Chanting ] Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! [ Shouting ] Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! [ Chanting Continues ] [ Shouts ] Hyah! Achilles! Achilles! [ Chanting Continues ] Agamemnon! We end this now! Right here, to the death! Whoa! I stand for High King Agamemnon! - Hyah! - [ Horse Neighs ] Hyah! Hyah! [ Horse Neighs ] [ Screams ] [Horse Neighs ] - Paris! - [ Paris Groans ] [ Soldiers Yelling ] - It's Paris! - After him! You've given me a hundred lifetimes worth of happiness. [ Gasps ] Paris! Paris! [ Groans ] Paris. [ Sobbing ] Please stay. Please stay. Please. Please. Goddess. [Horn Blows ] He wouldn't believe the prophecy. He always saw the fire in Cassandra's dream as a burning love for you. My king, the Greeks have sailed. Can it be possible? Search their camp. [ Dog Panting, Whimpering ] [SingingInForeignLanguage] - Mommy! - What is it? - [ Chattering ] - What is that? I've never seen anything like that. [ Chattering Continues ] The Aegeans are not to be trusted, nor their gifts. Archers! Burn it. Noble king, this is a day of great sadness foryou. Still, we must not be rash. This, whatever it is, might be an offering... or a gift to honor the great horse tamers of Troy. Hands that built this killed my sons. [Shouting In Foreign Language ] [ Foreign Language ] What is he saying? It seems they've left him here as some kind of sacrifice. [ Foreign Language ] What about the creature they left behind? Why so big? [ Foreign Language ] An offering to their goddess Athena. [ Foreign Language ] It's big to shadow our city. They say we cannot get it inside our gates. That's what they think, do they? - Hmm! - [ Foreign Language ] Dig him out. It's too big! [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Chattering ] [ Roars ] [ Gasps ] [ Chattering ] Cassandra? Can you see what happens? I see you... following. What am I following? Who? Where am I going? Where you belong. I belong with Paris. I gave myself up. It didn't save him! You gave yourself up, but you didn't surrender, did you? Did you? Do you see him? No. Not yet. [Hecuba ] I hear them playing. I can always tell that sweet laughter. [ Chuckles ] Little Hector. Do you see them? Yes, yes, yes. I see them. Are they All right? Yes, they' re All right. When they grow up, they will make you so proud of them. So very, very proud. You gave me such beautiful children. Such beautiful children. [Humming] We are free, my friend. [ Neck Snaps ] [ Taps Horse ] [ Men Gasping ] Well done, cousin. [ Men Grunting ] [Footsteps Approaching] Spare my queen. [ Gasps, Groans ] [ Screaming ] [ Sobbing, Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] Bring her. My lord, this way. As isaid, no trade. [ Screams ] No! [Helen Screaming] [ Grunting ] [Helen ] No! No! No! [ Crying] Leave her! [ Crying Continues ] [ Grunting ] [ No Audi ble Dialogue ] [ Baby Crying] [ Chattering ] [ Woman Screaming ] [ Chattering Continues ] [ Woman Screaming ] [ Horse Neighing ] Helen. What has he done? Go. Go quickly. Clytem nestra. I told you once. Never interfere! I come for I phigenia. She's not here. I know. [ Yelling ] My daughter! [ Yelling Continues ] My daughter! [Baby Crying] [ Women Screaming ] [ Soldiers Laughing ] [Narrator] War is waged by nations, but it is human beings that pay the price. For those ofus that survived, we are left with the memory... of shame and misery and bloodshed. The king is dead! In these dark times, the only thing we have left to hold on to is love, the one true gift of the gods. And it is through love... that we hope and pray... the gods will send us peace. - Paris. - Brave Helen. Wherever you are, take me with you. I cannot. Wil I we ever meet again? I've prepared your place. Good. Do you think I would kill you, Helen? I do not thank you for my life. I understand. I cannot love you. What will you do? [ Sniffs ] I will follow. I accept. There are students, who have been disappointed in every way. Even though betrayed, double-crossed and more... There are teachers who continue to believe in them. Hokkaido, Yoichi. About a 1 hour drive from Sapporo. In a small city with 23 thousand citizens exists Hokusei Gakuen Yoichi private high school. 15 years ago, for the first time in the whole nation... The school proactively admitted drop-outs. And allowed them a trial start. Currently, the circumstances of those who have been skipping school, bullying, delinquent,etc... Are becoming even more complicated. In this place, all of the problems of Japanese education are concentrated. Move aside! What the hell are you doing? You! You rascal! Huh? ! This is a talk about your life! Listen to what people have to say! You said before that Iwazaki is above family to you guys. Right? ! If Iwazaki is that important, then why are you people not protecting what Iwazaki has created for you guys! What Iwazaki has created... The thing that Iwazaki created at his own expense... Is YOU people! If I'm in the way... then say so! I will always back away! That's why I told you to leave! But for the period where Iwazaki is away... I will keep an eye on you people! Until then... I will not move a step! Shut up! What happened? What's this? No no.. err.. Just... Just.. A small kick there... Kick? Small kick? What the hell is that? Sorry... Igaue-sensei... Did you know that Yoshimori sensei was going to Takahashi Hostel? Err... Aaa... Er... well... I wonder what was it? .. 3C's form teacher right now is Igaue sensei. Am I right? Well, I'll take over the position till it's over. You didn't even discuss or report this to Igaue-sensei. Please do not do things just based on your own feelings. Because when anything happens... Igaue-sensei is the one who has to take the responsibility. Just like what I thought... Reporting is really important. Aaa... Even if it's simple... It's better to report. A single word or two would do. Sorry... Though only the door was broken this time round... But still the bill will be sent to the school. After discussing it with the principal... It's decided that the school will pay half of the bill... While Igaue-sensei pays the other half. What? No! That shouldn't be it! I was the one who caused the trouble! The one responsible is Igaue-sensei! From now on please discuss and report to Igaue-sensei. Can't stand it... Because of Yoshimori, the door fell, and the room became a Hidee room (room with drapery acting as separation). If this continues... That fellow... He's just going to say lots of crap and acting like he's the form teacher. He's trying to dominate us... Typical conceited behaviour of a new teacher... We should make him pay for such irritation. Well, that's right. If this continues, it will only benefit Yoshimori. Thought so too.., By the way tomorrow morning, seems like Igaue is going away for an educational guidance meeting. So our homeroom will be taken over by Yoshimori. Don't you think this is our chance? Chance? What kind of chance? Oh, I see.. As expected Yoshimori will probably just put up with it. So what are you going to do? There are outsiders. (literally: the customer group).. There... the outsiders... Those fellow who were just admitted into our class this spring. Oh... it's okay not to tell them. They don't know anything about Iwazaki. You're right... so regarding tomorrow morning... I will contact the boys. Sounds interesting. -Tomorrow morning? Want to go see together? Well... feel like going... But a bit worried too... Hey, look at your worried face. You don't want to see what's going to happen to Yoshimori? I want to... Did you hear? Yeah... that it was bad. Masaru? There's some message that I want you to pass to Hiromi, Shuuji and the others. Are you using Tsugaru dialect? I don't understand that, you rascal! Okay, understood. Tomorrow's homeroom. Right? Wakana... Don't you tell on us. Eh? You rascal! You like Yoshimori. Right? No! What do you mean? Are you sure? I'm the same as everyone. Really? ! Then that's good. Ah... Keep this from the outsiders of Room 3. Thanks. What? The outsiders of Room 3 are cleaning the bathtub right now. -Right now... What! Aren't those 1st year of Room 2 supposed to be on duty today? They suddenly had something on and requested us to do it. Though we did it unwillingly... Eavesdropping like that... You were the one who went on and on by yourself. Don't worry... We won't tell on you. Hot... Want to eat ice.. By the way, if there's anything you dislike... Then it's better if you make it clear. Akane... Oh no! Yoshimori is here. Again! Shh! I'm really sorry... Sensei, please lift up your head. I will be very careful from now on. Tsunemoto, Koga... I'm coming in... What happened? Ah... sorry... Both of us suddenly got a cold. Having a cold? Yes... That's really hot... Yes... Is Tsunemoto fine? Yeah! Instead... Sensei, what's up? Oh... I was thinking since the door is gone it would probably be cold. I brought some pocket heater. Thank you. Well you guys should sleep now. Yes. I will be coming every night from now on. I will keep coming till you guys give me the nods. Go to sleep... Good night. If you want to raise the readings of the thermometer... Dipping it in lukewarm water is the best. Can't stand it. This is no joke. Speaking of which... Iwazaki said the same thing before. What? 2 years ago when we just got admitted, Iwazaki came here... "I will keep coming here every night till you guys accept me. So be prepared." Was there something like that? Yes, there was! That time Akane was rebelling against Iwazaki and it was terrible. I forgot. Iwazaki was insistent too. Ah... No way! I'm totally not good at these things. Don't force yourself. Even though this is to pray for Iwazaki, we should do it little by little. What do you mean? Because the paper cranes fold by Akane is somehow weird. Hmm? When you lower these together, somehow there's something weird about it that I can't describe. Nanae... sometimes you speak pretty slowly. Is that so? It's a bit cute... Don't get too carried away by the praise. But being cute is not my fault... This is it. I'm going to cut all ties with you. Nanae is natural. Yoshimori is doing his job... Iwazaki is still unconcious. Arghh... It's so dark.. Aren't you hungry? Huh? There's yogurt in the fridge. You want some? No, I don't. By the way, don't you feel anything when I said things like it's so dark? Eh? Weren't you listening? Can't stand it... when people do that. Sorry... Again? Don't mind. I'm noting it down for the sake of not doing the same thing again... I'm going to get angry. Stop doing weird things. Today I made Akane angry again. Didn't listen to what people had to say. Even though she said it's so dark.. I didn't realise... Hey Akane... I've thought about it. Tomorrow morning's "thing"... Akane? Akane... How did your matchmaking session go, Saruwatari-sensei? Well, it's sort of gone... Well, good luck. -Yes... What happened to the others? It's only you guys? Don't just keep quiet! Say something! As we came, we obviously don't know... It seems yesterday they were passing messages to boycott homeroom this morning. Don't say I was the one who told you. Then what's this? You guys were not involved in it? That's because the people here are all outsiders who've undone is foolish. In time, even the sorest wounds must heal. - Morwenna's wed. - And is in hell. Drake, you cannot know this. He's been with her for half an hour. - The longer, the better. - As if there were any doubt. - l attended Mr Pearce this morning. - Is he...? Has he...? Has there been any new cause for alarm? No, you may rest assured that he will live another few weeks yet. He much appreciates your Thursday visits. He's only sorry they are so short. I have to get back to my wife. It is the duty of a vicar to minister to the sick, I do not shirk it. Well, sir? I have examined Mrs Whitworth as thoroughly as I can. I have no doubt, Dr Behenna, that she needs special care. Her mother and sisters will need to give permission. The care could be provided by her husband. When she refuses me my conjugal rights, threatens to kill our son if I enforce them? Do you need to enforce them? Dr Behenna, it is not for us to pronounce on the success of a marriage but if a husband cannot win his wife with kindness and love, he deserves to do without her. As to her state of mind, all symptoms of hallucination, morbid melancholia, folie circulaire or other indications that she is losing her reason, I cannot detect. In my opinion there is no doubt whatsoever. Your wife, Mr Whitworth, is completely sane. How many will be coming from London? Several Members of Parliament, useful ones like Monk Adderley, and of course Unwin Trevaunance, the Hastons and Lord Devoran. I suppose we must entertain the rest of local society. We need more servants. The staff aren't up to an occasion of this kind. Engage whom you will, spare no expense. We need to make a show. Londoners never move once they're here, they'll stay for days. Penrice can accommodate them. It's not you they look to for their convenience. I am sure none of the guests will have cause to complain. It really means a lot to you, getting back to Parliament. It's not so much the seat, it's the power that goes with it. Forgive me, Ross, but I can make no calls. I've told Demelza the whole country is sniffing, but as I was passing I thought I'd call. You see, Sarah has caught a cold too. Oh, I'm sorry. Nothing serious? Dwight? I believe I told you she would be an invalid all her life. I told myself the same thing to help me believe that, were she to be kept from infection, given all the care and attention that her loving father, - himself a doctor... - What are you saying? I knew that come the slightest infection, even a cold... her heart would not stand the strain. Well... Well, she's not...? - It will be a matter of hours. - This can't be so. I brought Bill Thomas back to life but not my own daughter. - Surely only a cold... - Will be enough. Does Caroline know? I told her this morning. I felt I had to now. - How's she taking it? - Very well. It has come as rather a shock but you need not worry, Caroline is taking it very well. Are you offering me a drink, Dwight? My husband clearly wishes me to become a toper. Or does he think that drink will soften the tragedy and turn it into something lighter? Caroline, you are deceiving no one. Or are we perhaps proposing a toast to someone? Do you know, Ross, I quite neglected my poor little dog for Sarah. What a mistake I made. How annoyed my uncle would have been that Sarah should have so short a stay. She may come through it. You can't be sure. She may live yet. I'm glad Demelza is not with you, Ross. I am hard and I can fend for myself. Demelza would not be so controlled. Demelza would not be so dignified. She does not understand dignity and all that it means. I believe that Demelza would cry, and that, I rather think, would ruin us all. is the doctor still upstairs? As I believe, sir. I just be going up if there be anything. No, no, no, no. There can be no doubt, ma'am, he is much recovered. Oh, not to mention his appetite. Are you not a magnificent recovery? It's been so long. There were times... Nature cannot be hurried, ma'am. Festina lente, as they say. The next thing is to bring you back to health. Oh, I am well enough, just a simple chill. I cannot think why my husband would summon you. If it please, ma'am, it is time Master Valentine was abed. - Yes. - So good nights be said. There. Come, young sir. Walk to the door. - Good night. - Good night. He's growing into a splendid young gentleman. And as for you, ma'am, 'tis time for a rest. - Doctor. - Ma'am? No, nothing. Good night, Doctor. Dr Behenna, how do you find my wife? Her condition causes me no concern. 'Tis but a summer chill. I am relieved to hear it. However, it is not of that I wish to talk. Sit, please. This is personal and what I have to say is confidential. Everything between doctor and patient is confidential. - This must be more so. - l don't follow you. I mean that only you and I will know of this conversation. If it comes to another's ears, I'll know I've not spoken. If you wish to speak, Mr Warleggan, you may do so. I can offer you no greater assurance than I have already done. So be it. You attended my wife at the birth of our son. Because of my wife's fall, he was an eight-month child, am I right? You are. You have seen many premature infants? Yes, a considerable number. And those born prematurely are physically different from those born in the full time? There are differences - weight, chiefly. Seldom the same loud cry. Nails. An eight-month child has no nails. That's not correct. They're small and soft. The skin is wrinkled and red. So is that of many born full-term. - l'm told they have no hair. - Sometimes they do. Which leads me to my final question, Dr Behenna. Was my son a premature child? On many physical questions it's not easy to say yes or no. It's now 18 months since the child was born. But you must remember the baby you delivered. - Did he have hard nails? - l believe so but... - And hair? - A little dark hair, as I recall. And the skin was wrinkled. I saw it and remember only slight wrinkling. I cannot say. - So, you will not tell me. - l cannot tell you! Had you asked me at the time... You remember the day the child arrived? Yes. In the evening, as I recall. And there was nothing that appeared strange. It did not occur to me to wonder. To pronounce on the mere matter of a month? In view of your wife's fall, I was only too happy to deliver her of a live child. Hardly a mere matter to me, that month. Indeed. And yet I cannot say after all this time. You have heard, of course, that Dr Enys is back. I understand he will soon be riding his rounds. Really? It was my information he was still ailing. - Some people think well of him. - As a doctor? As a doctor. That is their concern and not mine. Mr Warleggan, much as I should like to help you, you must realise that an ill-considered reply to so profound a question could impugn the honour of a virtuous woman and your wife has not... I await your reply. - Sir, I cannot make one. - You're saying? I am saying that to make reply I would need a certainty of mind, sir, which I do not possess. Oh, George! I didn't hear... - Why did you not speak? - l had nothing to say. Mary says that Valentine was asking for you at bedtime. - For me? Are you sure? - Oh, my dear. Why do you never see him now? He misses you so much. Perhaps tomorrow. I saw Behenna downstairs. - l trust he did not bore you. - On the contrary. Oh, forgive me. That was unkind. For all that he is unimaginative, he is a loyal friend. Hardly a testimonial. Would you rather have him as your doctor? - Who? - Dwight Enys. Oh! That wedding invitation. We must reply. - Would you? - As my doctor? Of course not. Although he supported you when Valentine was so ill? We shall always be grateful but as for him being my doctor... - Why not? - l know you don't like him. Nevertheless, we should go to the wedding. Half the county will be there and Caroline will expect it. Dwight is quite the hero since his rescue. No doubt his rescuer will also be there, receiving plaudits for an expedition which cost more lives than it saved. What is that? A birthday present for Geoffrey Charles. I had not forgotten. You may include these buttons from me. Oh, George! Let me see. Oh! They're beautiful, George. How good of you to remember. Sometimes it seems that other men's sons receive more than one's own. As for this, you may reply any way you wish. Excuse me. - Oh, Demelza! - Caroline! Oh, we've got so much to thank you both for. Who talks of thanks? You're our dearest friends. - Congratulations. - Ross. A shade different from France. Though no more comfortable in this coat. It sits splendidly on you, Ross. Oh, excuse me. Elizabeth! How beautiful you look. And such a lovely service. - Thank you. - l think I should cry at weddings... - Lady Basset. - ..but somehow never can. One couldn't cry with such a vision to admire. Sir Francis! It is being reminded, dear Francis, that one feels the need to weep. Oh, Ross, I do hope they'll be happy, they deserve it so. For pity's sake, can you not stand upright and lift your head? Hello! How are you? It's nice to see you. Captain Poldark! What a great pleasure to see you. I had hoped you'd be here. You haven't met Lieutenant Armitage. My wife. Mrs Poldark. I am under a great obligation to your husband. I am very happy it turned out so well. Do you know my uncle? Lord Falmouth. And his sister Mrs Gower. Sir, may I present Mrs Ross Poldark, Captain Poldark. Your husband has been much in the news. I have yet to congratulate him on his exploit. I only hope all these congratulations will not go to his head and send him off on another. And when is the baby due to arrive, Morwenna? Not for another five months. Take better care of yourself, you're looking very pale. We are expecting my youngest sister tomorrow. - Rowella? - She's to help me in the house. - Goodbye. Bye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye, Mrs Enys. Good luck! I liked Hugh Armitage. He seemed a really spirited young man. So he is. Why have you said so little of him before? What more should I have said? He spoke most gratefully of you. Then his gratitude was misplaced. I went to France to help Dwight. Armitage made his own escape and joined up with us afterwards. And he is related to Lord Falmouth. Apparently through his mother. Why? Is it important? It seems that the Falmouths and the Bassets don't care for each other much. Falmouth openly considers Basset an upstart. Yet Hugh seemed friendly enough with the Bassets at the wedding. A feud doesn't touch everybody. Anyway, he's a naval officer and no doubt will be off soon. We're to dine with the Bassets next month. - Oh, what did you do to Drake? - Gave him a scolding of course. Disappearing like that, worrying us all. He's no longer a child. I realised that when talking to him. Morwenna's wedding near sent him out of his mind. I've, er, I've asked him to call here in the morning. Why? Perhaps you'd care to be here when he comes. What are you about, Ross? Tomorrow morning, I said. Thank you, George, for giving me such a happy day. Did you notice how Lord Falmouth avoided us? That's hardly fair since we spent most of the day talking to the Bassets. My lord of Truro. Well, he may be due for an unpleasant surprise soon. What do you mean? There are fewer people pleased with his stewardship than he thinks. Much of the criticism stems from Francis Basset. He does not intend to challenge Falmouth's position? There is a by-election approaching. Falmouth has always told the burgesses who to vote for. How does that affect Francis? Well, of late, he has acquired more property in the town and since his bank is flourishing, I think at the next election he may put up his own nominee. - Are you involved? - Basset has hinted I may be included. I've heard nothing of this. I do not always trouble you with my thoughts. But why? That's what I'm here for. Sometimes it is best to keep one's feelings to oneself. What troubles you now? I cannot sleep. My mind will not be still. Osborne? Osborne. Yes. When my sister arrives tomorrow, please, for my sake, you will treat her gently? Well, why should I not? You have a tendency towards impatience and you are not always tolerant of other people's mistakes. Rowella is not yet 16 and her first time away from home. I shall treat her firmly but with forbearance as befits a master in his own home. How beautiful the bride looked today. She'll be a handful I'll warrant with that mettlesome look. They say Dr Enys is still weakened from his imprisonment. And Caroline remembered me. Although we have met only twice. God... let them be happy. Drake... Oh, Drake. "To be sold by auction "on Wednesday 9th October at the King's Arms in Chasewater, "that blacksmith shop, house and land in the parish of St Ann's "consisting of house of four rooms, brew house, bake house, barn, one anvil, one pair bellows, hammers, "tongs, two dozen new horseshoes, stable. "Six acres, including one and a half of winter wheat, "two and a half ploughed, six sheep. - "Debts f21 ." - l don't see... Since returning from France, you've said you'd like to move away. This is - six miles away. It's nearer the Warleggans but St Ann's is the most important coastal village - and trade is improving. - Ross, does this... - Well? - l have two pound and two shillin'. I could buy the horseshoes but naught else. I intend to buy it for you, if you want it. In France you almost died attempting to save my life. - l don't like being in debt. - Did she put you up to this? - It's the first she's heard of it. - It's a big property. Drake Carne, blacksmith. Does that not appeal? I don't know what to say. Well, you are only 20, it may be too much for you to tackle. It will not be too much, Cap'n Poldark. - Good. - Oh, Ross! Thank you! Can we ride over and see it? Today, this minute? Why not? I'm glad she hasn't got 20 brothers. - Oh. - Good ride. He says little but I know what he feels. It'll need work. I'll work. Whoa. Oh, Rowella, my dear. What a joy to see you. Hello, Wenna. I've missed you all so much. Dear Mama and Garlander. You must tell me all the news. You'll never know how much I've missed you. Oh, my dear, we will have such fun. You will meet Osborne at tea and Cousin Elizabeth is also coming to welcome you. Moral and religious decay, there are your worst enemies. All this talk of Armageddon, Morwenna, is put about by fools and gossips. A decay of willpower, an unwillingness to observe one's proper place in society, these should be of more moment to us. I remember... Nevertheless, matters in France are on the point of collapse. Morwenna simply remarked that these fears are unsettling. There I must disagree with you. Moral rectitude cannot be shaken. Proceed with righteousness and your enemies must fall. I'm afraid it's time I was leaving. I'm so glad you're here. You'll be a great help to your sister. - l shall write to your mother. - Thank you, Mrs Warleggan. You must call me Elizabeth, we are related. There, Rowella. Names are important in establishing a true relationship between people. With regard to myself, for example, to my face you may call me Mr Whitworth whereas in public, you should refer to me as "Vicar", for it is of my cloth you speak and not the mere man. How clever of you, Osborne, to express it so neatly. Don't come out, there's a chill wind for this time of the year. Osborne, give my love to your two little girls. Indeed I will and do give my regards to George. Well? Do you think you will like it here? Thank you, sister, I shall be near you. You must not be afraid of Osborne. He's not at all like Papa, is he? No. No, he's not. - When? - Not ten minutes since. - l thought you should know. - l shall summon Dr Behenna. Er, I took the liberty already, sir. Of all the careless damned actions. In fairness to Tom Harry, sir, we laid so many extra traps, things being as they have, to tread on one unexpected, well, it might happen to anyone. - And the ankle is broken? - Smashed, more like. Well, you shall take over as head keeper, understand? Until he's fit enough to return. Yes, sir. I shall expect the same standards of vigilance. Don't ee worry, sir. These eyes are younger than Tom's. And this fist has done as much good work in its time. Very well. Oh, Rowse? Sir? You were employed at Trenwith before I married the mistress? Aye, sir, I was. Can you recall who else worked within the household? Well, now, there were, er, George Tabb. Him and his wife stayed till the end. George Tabb? Long-faced and shifty-looking? That be him. Would he remember the people who called at Trenwith before I married the mistress? - Depends how much you pays him. - l want facts, not lies. If it be goings-on inside you want, he'd be the man to ask. - Do you know where to find him? - Horse keeper he be, and porter down at the Fighting Cocks Inn. I wish to speak to him, in private. I shall meet him out riding. Can you arrange it? - Whatever you say, sir. - That will be all. Thank you. - Good night. - Good night, sir. I went to bid Morwenna's sister welcome. I haven't seen the child since she was eight. A quiet creature but I expect she'll settle. is anything wrong? Tom Harry has had an accident. With typical intelligence, he walked onto his own trap. - Oh, how horrible. - Sid Rowse bought me the news. He also made mention of an old servant of yours - George Tabb. Tabb? Why should he mention him? It seems he wants to talk to me. What about? - Old times. - Old times? But George... Did we agree a date when the Bassets should come and dine? Not knowing your commitments, I said I would write. Why? Events, it would seem, have a way of overtaking one if one is not careful. The talk in London is all of France. News has it that the days of the Directory are over and with it, the whole Republic. Nor should we be surprised. Well, in 1790 you ladies could buy a hat in Paris - a good one, mind you - for 14 livres, now, five years later, the same object will cost you nigh on 600. They are themselves to blame. A country should not wage war without a sound financial basis. This young general, er, Bonaparte, has he not now been put in charge of the French army in Italy? Indeed, yes! There's a whole group of young generals, of whom Hoche is by far the most gifted. It's hard to believe the dynamic of the revolution is altogether dead. This Bonaparte cleared the streets of Paris with grapeshot, killing hundreds of his own people. What is your view of the French, Lieutenant Armitage? Although nine months in France, Mrs Enys, I saw no more than in the first few days, when I was moved from prison to prison. - And you, Dr Enys? - Unfortunately, Lady Basset. Once inside Baton you could have been in purgatory for all you saw of France. I, for one, regret it very much. If our young men could not bring us hats from Paris they should at least have brought us news of them. Be content they did not, Mrs Enys, because a hat designed by a revolutionary and costing 600 livres would surely not be an object of beauty to an English eye. I'm relieved to hear it. My uncle speculated that in dining with a Whig I might hear talk favourable only to the revolution. Lord Falmouth should have known better. A true Whig is as patriotic as any man. - Quite so, I... - Though some may have applauded the principles of this revolution, few now support its excesses. Your uncle need have no fear of what you will hear in this house. Whereas it seems the wind has dropped, the sky cleared and we'd all be the better for a walk in the garden. Mrs Poldark? Ah, I'm sure you'll enjoy the garden. - Shall we? - Yes indeed. Poldark, may I deprive you of your exercise and ask you to remain behind? There's something I wish to discuss. Sir, if you wish me to apologise I will gladly do so. Oh, never. Never. - The fault was mine for being so touchy. - Thank you. The gardens are beautiful. - Oh. - Forgive me. - Since my imprisonment my eyes... - The light is very bright. Dazzling. Will you return to the navy, Lieutenant Armitage? When the surgeons are finished with me. They say the trouble came from reading and writing in semi-darkness. Oh. Were you able to write home? Caroline received only one letter from Dwight in a year. No, no, no, I was writing for my own satisfaction. - Poetry. - Poetry? - l've never met a poet before. - It's not to be taken seriously. Verse would be a more modest estimate. Captain Poldark has conferred two great favours upon me. - Oh? - My liberty and the opportunity of meeting his wife. I am not skilled in such courtesies... I was not trying to be courteous... but truthful. When may I see you again? And Ross, of course. Oh, I... Perhaps I may call on you both? You are but a few miles away. I think we should join the others. They will wonder what has become of us. You know, of course, Mr William Hick, the new mayor of Truro? - Not personally. - You should. I could effect an introduction for you. But is he not Lord Falmouth's man? Mr Hick is ambitious. He allows himself to take a broad view. Not that I doubt his protestations of loyalty but there is a difference between wishing a man well and allowing him to ride roughshod over you. Hick is a sensitive man. Sir Francis, I've been aware of a certain subtlety in your conversation. - Could we not come to the point? - Hm. Voting in the parliamentary borough of Truro rests with 25 aldermen and capital burgesses, most of whom are heartily sick of always being told by Lord Falmouth - who should represent them in London. - Go on. Well, quite simply, in this by-election we propose to put up a nomination of our own. You are suggesting something in the nature of a palace revolution? I am assisted in my thinking by Mr Hick. How convenient. And your nominee, if elected, would be expected to vote in Parliament as directed by you? No, but there may be occasions when we wish to strike our own line. - Against Pitt? - No, mainly I support Pitt. But we believe that only we know what is right for Cornwall and should be allowed a voice accordingly. - l wish you well. - And I you. - Me? - You will allow me, I trust, to put your name forward as candidate for the seat? Do you fancy yourself as the wife of a Member of Parliament? That's no concern at the moment, all I'm asking is why you're turning it down. - But your answer is not definite? - It's freezing. Prudie, build up the fire. But there's naught amiss with the fire. Are you sure refusal would be the right course? - How could it be anything else? - It offers great opportunities. - For self advancement? - For exercising influence. Could he do that? If I could call my soul my own. - Hasn't Basset said... - l place no weight on that. I don't fancy being elected just because the burgesses resent Falmouth. Ross is right, there's little to choose between them. Both will plant a foot on your neck. - That's not what he's saying. - He ought to be. Basset is one of the most enlightened gentry. - But only for his own ends, it's obvious. - Caroline! I put the broth by the fire. I agree. If I turn this invitation down... lt would be for the wrong reasons! Ain't nobody 'ere got ears no more? is it because you don't want to offend Lord Falmouth? No, but I would owe Basset and he could drive a hard bargain. I think it would be a mistake. Then let me put your name forward. - You go instead of me. - No. No, he's not strong enough. Besides, I haven't brought him to matrimony to lose him immediately to Westminster. - Prudie, where's that broth? - l told ee. - Ah. - l thought you'd lost your stomach. - Children asleep? - Faster than two birds. Thank you, Prudie. I'm sorry. I shouted at you. And I at you. Dwight? You're worried about him. I knew there was more than a joke in your words. Ohh... His recovery is taking so long. The slightest effort leaves him breathless. - But your marriage. - What marriage? Oh. That was a cruel thing to say, I shouldn't have said it. We knew it would take time. We love each other, I know that. Well, that's more important than the other, so they say. An old maid's tale put about by those who never had either. Anyway, you're a fine one to console me. What do you mean? If you and I walked into a room full of men, they would first look at me but soon be clustered around you. What nonsense! Whatever put that into your mind? Hugh Armitage. Hugh? Whatever made you think...? Oh, Caroline. Anyway...we shall probably never see each other again. I wish you'd change your mind, Sam. Come and work with me here. Nothing'd please me more than to see the Carne brothers as partners. - l prayed on that. - What was the answer? Later, maybe. Who's to say in a year or more, when you're established, you might not be wedded? Would you want me then? - Those thoughts are all over. - For Morwenna maybe. - There'll be others. - l said no, didn't I? ! It would be bad enough if she had passed away and I should never see her the more. But to think of her wedded to that man chills the heart in me. No, there'll be no wife for me while he and she be together. I prays for you, Drake. And have done ever since this happened. Pray for Morwenna. She needs it more than me. God's life, be it a praying' fest? But a wheelwright I wants. Which be the smith? Me, I reckon. Carne by name. Surgeon Behenna wants this mended. Do it, can ee? - l reckon. - Tomorrow. He needs it to hold down his patients. - His patients? - Yes. When he pulls out their teeth, see! What's up with ee? Catch flies with your clapbox. Oh... Forgive me, sister. How be your soul? What do you mean, lug? Of a sudden I got a deep concern for your salvation. Dear, I was right - it is a praying' fest! Shoot me if I ever seen the equal. Sister, we have meetings thrice weekly at Reath Cottage, over Tremellan way. You'd be welcome. We pray together. Do you really think you can get me to a praying' fest? - Stranger things have happened. - Hmph! Not to me. 'Mellan, you said? Me and my brother have a cottage there. Leastways he has. I'm to stay here now. I'm walkin' that way myself, preacher. You can walk along with me. - Mind, there's a condition. - What's that? That ee don't talk God to me all the way! Go on, Sam. I'll see you next week. God bless you. I'll keep prayin', brother. Coming, Preacher? Oh, chain'll be fixed by the mornin'! All right. I'll confess I'm a little concerned, Vicar. But not serious? No, not serious. - Does it concern the baby? - Indirectly. Vicar, it's my duty to speak frankly. It concerns the question of marital relations with your wife. Forgive me, I know how embarrassing this is. The aspects to which you refer are between a man and his maker. - And his wife. - Naturally. And sometimes they must also concern his medical advisor. You're a heavy man, Vicar. "Heayy"? Well set, perhaps. I do justice to my meals but I am not a glutton! - l fail to see how... - It's about the baby's health. Your wife is not strong, Vicar. Not strong at all. And so each time... - Each time... - Yes, yes, I understand. - Then what is the remedy? - Remedy? - What can you do about it? - l? There's nothing I can do. But you must cease forthwith to have marital relations. - "Forthwith"? - It is not unknown to you. - Your first wife... - That was different. Esther was always so very... understanding Understanding has nothing to do with it. This is a medical necessity concerning your wife and child. If these are closer to your heart... Of course they are! But I'm a full-blooded man, Doctor! Since Esther died, life for me was...was... lt's the common lot of man to be borne with fortitude. Fortitude. Oh, no, Dr Behenna. Don't you talk to me about fortitude. I have only to look at my own parish to see it expressed, yet I am expected to embrace abstinence. Great heavens, man! I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do. Follow my instructions or I'll not be responsible for the baby or your wife. Good day to you, Vicar. Oh, God. How can You ask this of me again? What do you want? How long have you been there? A moment, Mr Whitworth, no longer. I wanted to ask about my sister. - She's well enough. - Seeing you lost in prayer... I was not. I am suffering from an acute headache. If there's anything, any way in which I can be of help, you have only to ask. You're most kind. Should you need me, I will be with the children. - Do you know my name? - Emma, you said. Get along, you lug - my other name! It's Tregirls. I've heard talk of Tholly Tregirls. My father. A rare, liquorish old devil he be. Damn him. - It is a virtue to forgive. - l do now. Despite he deserted us when we was no taller than that grass stalk. Hey! Where do you think you're goin'? Where have you brought me? This be Warleggan land! Be off with ee, Sam Carne, or I'll give ee a coating. Time's finished when worms could come crawlin' on this land! He's with me, Sid Rowse! Lay a hand on him and I'll never speak to you again. Off, the both of you. The master's comin' this way. You - don't you come back here again. You know Sid Rowse well, then? - He want to wed me. - Will you? I say that depend, don't it? You still there, George Tabb? You wait here now. Master be ridin' along any moment. He got some questions to ask ee. Mind you answer 'em. That seems to me a very sour view of marriage. Because I see so many of my friends bound in unions they find tedious and restricting. I don't take a sour view of love. For the overwhelming love of an Isolde, I'd jettison everything. Even life. - Ross, look who's here! - Why, Ross! I hoped to see you but feared I'd miss you. I must leave soon. I wondered who the horse belonged to. Lieutenant Armitage brought this plant from his uncle's garden. It's a new rare plant. It's called... What did you say? A magnolia. But not from my uncle's garden. He had three brought over from the Carolinas. I persuaded him to part with one as a gift to the wife of the man who saved his nephew from the French. How has Lord Falmouth been since the Enys wedding? As well as can be expected. Since his wife died his sister runs the house but he lacks friends of his own. It seems to me he grows more morose by the day. Hardly pleasant for you. Will you be staying long? In these parts, I mean. Until I am given a clean bill of health. It could be a week or a month. For your sake we must hope it's as soon as possible. There is something I wish to discuss concerning my uncle. - Uh-huh? - This feud with the Bassets. It places me in a most uncertain position. Sir Francis and his wife have been most kind and treated me with no less hospitality than my uncle. - For that reason I... - Yes? I find myself torn between them. - My first loyalty is to my family. - Of course. Now with this by-election there is talk of opposition led by Sir Francis against my uncle. I wondered, have you heard of it? Opposition led by Sir Francis Basset? To put up their own candidate for election. I know nothing about it. George Tabb? Mr Warleggan. I want to ask you some questions. These questions I'll put to you in confidence. - l expect you to treat them as such. - Sir? They're concerned with the period two years ago when you were in the service of Mistress Warleggan, do you understand? Who called at Trenwith before I married her? What called, sir? To see Mistress Elizabeth, you mean? There'll be money in it. Sir? Two guineas. But you'll have to earn them. Magnolia, he called it. And rare. We must cherish it. Did you see Sir Francis? He had his answer at midday. - Who will he ask now? - There are plenty of other men. None as good as you. Are you...disappointed? Not for me, that's not what I mean. But each year as other men grow more content you grow less so. I just want you to be happy, that's what I mean. And... you, Demelza? - Are you happy? - Of course I'm happy. - Are you angry? - Angry? With Hugh Armitage? No. Does he move you? His eyes light up when they look at you. I know. Oh, Ross, I... You have a wonderful common sense. I rely on that. George, why will you not trust me? Why will you not tell me what troubles you? - l have no idea... - You think I cannot see? You imagine things. No, you speak barely a word to me for days and none at all to your son, a child not two years old! - What have we done? - My dear Elizabeth... You cannot mean that phrase and behave to us as you do! Oh, George... lf you but knew what it costs me to watch you torment yourself like this. - l do not mean to... - l know you don't. You are very dear to me. Then show me! You must not blame me for being jealous. Jealous? Of what, for heaven's sake? ! If I were to say Ross Poldark. Well, is it so strange? After all, you were, to say the least, his friend. That was a long time ago. Another world. Once you would defend him against all criticism. - Then my feelings have changed. - Have they? Are you accusing me of hypocrisy? Or what then? Infidelity? How can I convince you that Ross means nothing to me in the manner you intend? - Yet your feelings have changed. - l wouldn't care if I never saw him again! - l am writing to Sir Francis. - George! Accepting an invitation to dine with him next week. - Next week? You did not tell me! - l shall be going alone. He has a matter of importance to discuss with me, he says. It may involve our residing part of the year in London. "..sanctify yourselves, therefore, "and be holy." No, no, there must be more fire in it. Ah, that's better. Leviticus 20. "And if a man shall take his brother's wife, "it is an unclean thing." Yes, yes. Good, good. "Nakedness... Bare their sin." Good, good. "They...shall be children." That is most profound. Excuse me for now. How's the investigation of that student Shimojima going? Thanks to you... I placed my men at all possible locations where he may show up. We'll arrest him in no time. That's good. But then we must release that woman Namiji. Well, that's more likely so. She's too good to let go. We'll find someone else to interrogate before then. How about that one? That's the second wife of Sennosuke Kikushima a famous jeweler in Ginza. She's 20 years younger than him. She's more like a daughter than a wife, they say. You know so well. I see her in women's magazines a lot. You're quite knowledgeable for a military man. - Please have a picture taken. - Is it all right? Then let's do it together. What can you do for me? Even though it's your request, I don't see it happening. Even with the power of the military police? Unless she's a criminal... - Mrs. Kikushima. - Hello. You're blushing like a teenaged boy. That's silly! Merchant-class scumbag. Cheers. FAIRY IN A CAGE Producer: Yoshihiro Yuhki Original Story: Oniroku Dan Screenplay: Seiji Matsuoka...

Director: Koyu Ohara... EASTERN MILITARY POLICE HONGO SQUAD Lance Corporal Taoka reporting for duty! Good. Come in. Thank you. Army Military Police. Lance Corporal Keita Taoka. As of April 26, 1941... I've been assigned to the Eastern Military Police Hongo Squad. I'll be reporting to you from now on. Good work. Do you know how to use them? Yes. I learned how at military police school. As you already know these were all given by the emperor himself. Take great care of them and contribute to our country. Yes, sir. Taoka, we don't get our salary for simply being military policemen. Our duty is to protect our country by following strict military rules. I understand. I would sacrifice my own life for my country. Good. Actually, there's something that I want to show you. - Come with me. - Yes, sir. Hey! Are you still going to resist? Get up! Be ready! Can't a deserter like you read the military imperial instructions? One, a soldier shall be loyal no matter what. One, a soldier shall respect... Hey, look me in the eye! One, a soldier shall sever his desires. Say it louder! - How is it? - Yes. - Right here. - Yes. You idiot! Don't keep looking down! Shimojima, you'll feel much better once you confess! Shimojima, say it! Say something! How's it going? Did he confess anything? No. He's a tough one to crack. I thought so. He's not an easy one. Down with capitalism! Down with the emperor! Touto Popular Front... Where did you get the money to print these flyers? - It was Namiji, right? - No. What do you mean "no"? Namiji has confessed already. No way. She's got nothing to do with it. How can you be so sure? On March 24th, you went to a cafe in Shinbashi, didn't you? Yes, but I didn't go there to see Namiji. I couldn't get in because there was a fan club gathering for a kabuki actor, Sennosuke Inoue, organized by someone named Kikushima. What? By Mrs. Kikushima? You mean Kimiko Kikushima, wife of jeweler Sennosuke Kikushima? Yes. The manager of the cafe told me so. Please look into it. Namiji is innocent. Let me take over for a second. I want to ask him a few questions. How's our new catch this time? She's quite stubborn. Is she still chained to the house? Yeah, she's in a cell, naked. She's too good to release afterjust one day. I'm still looking forward to tomorrow. I don't want you to be obsessed with some criminal's whore. I'm doing this for the country. He's a national criminal. Are you jealous? Please tie me up really hard. I feel so naughty today. Okay, I got it. What do you want me to do? Don't be modest. Come on. How do you want me to give it to you? Give it to me like I'm a whore. Good. Stand up. Hold it tighter. That whore's pussy was much tighter than this. I'm jealous. Come on now. Do you want me to go back to that whore? No, I don't want you to go back to her. Oh, it's you. Didn't I tell you not to call me here so many times? What? Is it true? I understand. Then go ahead. Right away. Yes. KIKUSHIMA Who are you? You are under arrest for breaking the national security law. What are you doing? You're coming to the military police headquarters. Go inside. Maron Murayama. Mrs. Kikushima. I never thought I'd see you like this. This must be a mistake. Why am I being treated like this? Well, I can't answer that. I've only been asked to help with the interrogation. Interrogation? I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but you're under suspicion of handing over money to an anti-war student activist. Anti-war? Me? Who said such a thing? This man. Sennosuke. Sennosuke Inoue, a young kabuki actor that you support. The money you handed him went straight to an anti-war student activist. That's a lie, missus. I don't know anything about this. Shut up! We have all the evidence. This is... This is your class photo from elementary school. Look at this carefully. This is you. And this is Shimojima right here. I don't know. I mean, I know Shimojima. But I haven't seen him since elementary school. It's true. Are you saying the military police are wrong? Sennosuke. That's my... That's right. It's your passbook. When did you... It looks like you spent a great deal of money. Some of the transaction dates and amounts match the exact dates and amounts Shimojima paid to the printer of those flyers. That's total nonsense. She seems quite confident despite the fact that she's lying. She must be hiding something. Please go on with the interrogation. Mrs. Kikushima, I don't want to do these kinds of things. Unfortunately, this is my job. Please come this way. What are you going to do? What do you think, Mrs. Kikushima? Do you like this room? Maron Murayama, you're punishing the innocents in this room using interrogation as your excuse. I'll decide if you're innocent or not. The boy is very handsome and noble. I like him very much. Do meet him. - l sure will. Look, manager. My son had left here last evening for Nainital. But he has just called from some village... that there's been a landslide on the road to Nainital... and the road has got blocked. You do this immediately. - Yes, tell me. Go to Bungalow number 15 on the Mall Road. Kajal, Seth Kishorilal's daughter from Delhi is living there. What name did you say? - Kajal, Seth Kishorilal's daughter. Yes. - As soon as he reaches there.. he will telephone Kajal. - He will telephone Kajal. Not Kajal. Say Miss Kajal. Don't you know that she is going to be married to my son Manjeet? Manjeet Kumar Dana... What's the difference between you and I? If at all, the only difference is in our wealth. And on the strength of that wealth you are stealing that girl too... who has been made mine before you. But I will never let it happen. Kajal was mine, she is mine, and she will remain mine. What're you trying to do, Sanjay? Have you thought of the consequences? My name is Kajal. My father had telephoned me from Delhi...to meet you. Please come. Come in, Aunty. Greetings, Aunty. - Bless you. May we sit? Yes, please. Sit, Aunty. Actually, I... They are your... - My bodyguards. Carry on your conversation with Kajal. I've work to do. All right. Greetings. - Bless you. Alas, only if you were my childhood companion. How should I tell you that I'm your childhood companion? Father says that Sanjay will never be found. and that it's better to forget him. I wanted to forget you. But after meeting you now, it will be very difficult to forget you. He must be wondering why I'm silent. She must be wondering why I'm silent. So... Do these people accompany you everywhere? Yes. Everywhere. Don't you feel suffocating? - l do. A lot. How about fooling them and running away from here? It'll be great fun. But how? Who's that girl? - She's the gardener's daughter. I've got an idea. Come with me quickly. Where's Prakash? - He's gone for shopping. Listen... But what will I wear? Here you are. Come on. Be quick. is it okay? I will fool these people and come right back. Bye! He's taken away my girl! Colonel Subodh Mukerji. Gardener, I'm going to the club. My nephew Shomu will be coming from Delhi. Ask him to call me up at the club. And take care of the house. Lot of thefts are happening these days. All right, sir. The baldies have come. Gardener, where's my dear Uncle? He's gone to the Club. He has asked you to telephone him there. All right. I want to speak to the Colonel. Call him quickly. lt's urgent. I'm your neighbour speaking. Come back quickly. Thieves have entered your home. And the gardner... - They've hit your gardner and made him unconscious. Come back quickly. Let's hurry up. Go there. And you go there. The rascal has run away with my girl. Let him return. Then I will... Who are you? You are wearing my dress, and calling me shut up? What happened? Change your dresses. I'll tell you what next. Remember Prakash. I'm not Sanjay. - You aren't Sanjay. I'm Manjit Kumar Dana. - You are Manjit Kumar Dana. You are my servant. - You are my servant. Not I. You are my servant. - Not I. You are my servant. What're you staring at? Move back. Why're you blocking the way? What're you doing here? Move back. Colonel...colonel! - Here I am. Catch these people. Look at them! It's a lovely tune. What song is it? Do you want to hear it? - Yes. Here it goes. This song is from the South. lt is sung only somebody falls in love. You didn't ask why I sang this song? There's a song in our East too. You can understand the girl's reply. is it? What's the song? I had been thinking since morning that... as soon as you come, I will tell you... Tell me what? - That... You wanted to say something. Nothing. - Tell me. Look over there! What a lovely butterfly! Isn't it? Maybe. You were saying something. That I'm very happy having come to Nainital. And you are also happy after meeting me? Yes. Do you know... I had spent my childhood right here in Nainital? is it? - Yes. And I had a very good friend in my childhood. Friend? Do you remember his name? Sanjay. - Sanjay? I know very well a boy by this name. is his father's name Ram Kumar? - Yes. Where does he live? - Right here in Nainital. Take me there rightaway. - You are so restless? If you know me well... I've understood. You don't know any Sanjay. You are lying. Lying? Look, Kajal... Looks like the cops released them too soon. Let them be. Tell me, do you really know Sanjay? Let's do this. I will call him to my home this evening. Come there and meet him. - Okay. At what time? At 5 o'clock. Now neither do I need your clothes, nor your name. Sanjay will be in front of Kajal today. Her 'yes' or 'no' will decide my fate. She's come very soon. Where's the bedroom? - That way. Aunty, let me speak to Kajal. What? She has already left? All right. I'm going out. lf Manjeet says something... Who's this cartoon? - He's our cook Prakash. What a fool! Get going. My name is Manjeet Kumar Dana. What? - ls the name long? You can call me just Manjeet. Come on. Actually I was supposed to have come here yesterday. But I was held up because the road was blocked. My manager must have informed you. Manager? - Yes, manager. He informed you, didn't he? - Yes. Why're you standing? Please sit. Hot tea, manager. - Yes. I was about to telephone you that my luck... The bell rang, and I found you right in front of me. You don't seem happy upon meeting me? - No, nothing of the sort. Look, don't reject me so soon. Even if you have to reject me, let it be a couple of days later. So that I can think how I should commit suicide. By consuming poison, with the noose, or by jumping off a hill. What're you saying? - l'm right, madam. I've been to Hong Kong, London, Paris, New York...all over the world. But I didn't see any face anywhere worth giving a second look. But you are smashing! I lost my senses when I saw you. I got crazy! The thing is, my head is paining. I will cure it in a jiffy. But give me a smile once. How wonderful! The sunshine has appeared, the flowers have blossomed. Manager, hot tea for the madam. I will get the pill for the headache rightaway. I want to tell you something. I don't want to cause harm to anybody's livelihood. Else, if I tell Manjit about it, he will dismiss you rightaway. But listen... - Despite being merely a manager... how could you dare do all this, Look, Kajal... Here, madam. This tablet is from King Kong, the famous doctor from Hong Kong... which makes a person fit and fine in a jiffy. Try it. Gosh! You have such a wonderful smile! Swallow it with tea. Do you know a grand programme is going to be held today? Where? - Here in Nainital. Look at this. Whoever dances and sings the best, will get a gold medal. Are you participating? - Participating? Accompany me and see for yourself. The gold medal'll be around my neck. You will come, won't you? I sure will. I'm wonderstruck! With you on my side... Who are these rascals? - They are Miss Kajal's bodyguards. I'm sorry, friends. I've just been informed that you are bodyguards, not donkeys. So what was I saying... Do they stay with you always? - Yes. To the club too? - Yes. Why? - Dad's orders. Shall we leave? - Yes. Yes? - Do you have medicine... for diarrhoea? For the horses? - Yes. How many horses do you have? Four. - Here you are. The dosage is enough for four horses for four days. Their stomach will be cleansed totally. It's priced at five rupees. - Five... What will you have? - Nothing. You drink tea. I will go home. How can it be? Then who will see my dance at the club? Two cokes for us, and... What would you like to have? Nothing? That's not possible. Get hot tea for all of them. I'll explain to you. Do you see this button? By pressing this button... the watch becomes magnetic and pulls the heaviest of things. Watch the fun now. - What? But listen... Thank God at least you smiled. I will be right back. Yes, sure. You will get four rooms. How many? You are two men? And four rooms... Our order? - Yes. It's not cold. Get ice. - Rightaway. Yes, there are bathrooms in every room. Yes, please do come. We serve all kinds of foodstuffs. Yes, we serve everything. You should visit us. What's the matter, sir? Do you want to make a call? - Yes. What's the number? You didn't like the number? Let it be. There was some urgent work. Why don't you start? Now watch the fun with these four baldies. What do you mean? I've mixed medicine for diarrhoea in their tea. What? Keep a watch on them. I will be right back. I will be right back. What did you mix in our tea? - Nothing. You did mix something. - Come on. Tell us. What's the matter? - What's the matter, you ask? Something has been mixed in our tea. We're suffering from diarrhoea. How can you say that? Our tea is the finest. No! Something has surely been mixed in it. You are doubtful? I will drink and demonstrate. Nothing has been mixed in it. You people are suspecting it unnecessarily. lt's such a fine tea. So we have put these baldies to their right place. Shall we go the club now? - l've to go home first. Why? - l've some work. In this dance-and-song contest... this one was the fifth challenger whom Mr. Manjeet has defeated. If a new challenger doesn't come out on the field in 15 seconds... the prize will be given away to Mr. Manjeet. When did you come? - Just a while ago. Tell me, where had you been? - To the club. Father, who were those people? New bodyguards. The earlier ones were useless. I dismissed them. I met your daddy in Delhi. He too will be coming soon. Daddy will be calling any time. May I go, sir?

Let me arrange for another manager. You may go thereafter. It's a matter of only a day or two. - All right. Sanjay, I've received a letter from your father. He's coming over for the prayers on the occasion of Shivratri. I've resigned from the job. - ls that all? You've ran away? People even commit murders in love. - What nonsense! It's true. Manjeet has snatched his beloved. He should kill Manjeet. If he can't, I can. - Lay off, will you? Rajesh dear, I'm Ramu Uncle speaking from London. Yes, Ramu Uncle. Tell me. Did you meet Sunita?

My daddy says you are the greatest flirt in the whole of London. You lose control the moment you see a beautiful face. A lot of beautiful faces have come into your life, and gone too. Then why do you love me? - l'm helpless. Your face is so charming, that I can't control myself. You and your charming... Don't be scared. Daddy has gone to Paris. Else, would I have called you home? - l know that quite well. I'm very scared of Daddy's anger. Do you know...he wants me to get married to Motiram's son Ranjeet. And you? - Do you need to ask that. Welcome, Mr. Motiram. Come, Ranjeet. Greetings, Uncle. - Bless you, dear. Daddy, you were... - Yes, I couldn't go to Paris. They called me from Birmingham that they're coming to London.

My daughter won't participate in any programme with you. I've given my word to the club. I will get a bad name. is this your final decision? Then you too had better hear this, Mr. Kewalchand. Not just today, but at every stage of my life, Sunita will side with me. Despite knowing that Sunita and I love each other intensely... you still want to get her married to someone else. But you cannot force your whims on us. You may commit any atrocity on us but you can never separate us. Don't think that I cannot respond to your slap. I haven't raised my hand on you thinking that... I will be having another kind of relationship with you in future. What I had said is happening. What will you do now? She won't be singing the quwwali. Let's replace Sunita with Uma. She remembers the entire quwwali. No! Sunita's place will be kept vacant.

You guys have told your stories. Now let me tell you one Please. Please. I have a condition.. fear is forbidden As they say, those that are afraid, are dead meat Silly. Anyway. This is a story of seven friends Who drove out of town together Suddenly, the tyre of their car was punctured What could they do? It was dark and secluded outside They got out of the car and saw a light somewhere far away Following the light, they got.. Here But how were they going to spend the night? They started telling the others one story after another Listening to the stories, all the friends.. started going out, one at a time What they did not know was that there was someone.. waiting for them outside He was no ordinary man. He was a genius And every genius has his tragedy. The tragedy with this genius.. was that he wanted to rid people of the fear in their hearts Because it is fear that is destroying the world But people are still afraid of new things Like the way your friends were afraid When you arrived here, how many were you in all? Six? Seven.. ? And yet, you were scared. I saw it When you got out of the car, you were scared of the seclusion Then you were scared of the darkness. You didn't want to go here and there You were scared of fear.. and I hate fear I cannot stand fear. Unless you face fear, fear kills you But your friends are never going to be scared again I have wiped out their fear. There's just one way of doing it Finish the one who feels scared All your friends are dead You're still not afraid, are you? Because you think this is perhaps a story too But what if this were not a story? You'd be scared, wouldn't you? He must die! I told you, fear is forbidden He got scared. So he'll have to go. He'll have to go now. But I like you. You don't get scared.. you're a nice girl Relax. Easy, easy Are you scared now? Fear is not allowed! It's forbidden! I don't kill. Fear kills you! It's okay now.. you'll not be scared. You won't I told you, I don't kill You've killed them all! Inspector.. Inspector.. listen to me! Inspector, he's the man who killed my friends! Why won't you listen to me? I died too When both of us are dead, what have we to fear? Relax. "You have just as much life.. " "as the courage you possess" "Finish the killer.. " "fear is forbidden" "Those that are afraid.. are dead-men" "Those that are afraid.. are dead-men" "Two multiplied by three is.. I forgot." "Listen to my heart.." "Listen to my heart.." "Listen.. " "Is dead.." "Heed your heart.. " "fear is forbidden" "Get what I say.. fear is forbidden" "Those that are afraid.. are dead-men" "Those that are afraid.. are dead-men" "Those that are afraid.. are dead-men" "Live to die. Die to live." "You didn't do the homework even today?" "Never. Never. Never ever. Fear." "Listen to my heart.." "fear is forbidden" "Get what I say.. " "Listen to my heart.." "Listen to my heart.." "Those that are afraid.. are dead-men" "Listen to my heart.." "Your journey begins now." Two multiplied by two is two. - Here's the third story. "Two multiplied by four is.."

You obviously didnae get that in here. That looks edible. Don't ask. Is Harry still hangin' aboot? Aye. Like a shadow. He's playing pool the noo. He's waiting for us to slip up. How long's that been?

Yer not supposed to drink yer ain, but I'm not waiting an hour for that bevvy trolley to come up! A wee dram? No, yer all right. Is there a film? But I'll no' be paying for headphones.

All right, Jack? You're a fly bastard! I booked it yesterday. I'm no' sittin' on my arse for two weeks while you have a guid time! Oh, not the windae seat! I've got a weak bladder, an all. I'll be up and doon like a bloody yo-yo! New York, eh? Toronto... Aye, Toronto. Jeezo. WOOF! Oh! Woof! Oh! Happy wee thing, eh? Aye! Let's see... Sorry to keep you waiting. I-is this Lt. Col. Roy Mustang? My humble name is Edward Elric... Humble? You don't have to be so tense. R-right! We'll be boarding the 9:20 train bound for Central. Roger. Er, hold on... There's one before that, isn't there? - Yes there is, but it sounds like it's already leaving. - Now departing! Now departing! Get on that one. But why...? Just hop aboard that one! Al! We're getting on! Hurry! I'm testing their luck. Man cannot obtain anything without first sacrificing something. In order to obtain anything, something of equal value is required. That is alchemy's Law of Equivalent Exchange. At the time, we believed that to be the true way of the world. I don't get Lt. Col. Mustang. I wonder what kind of person he is. Brother, am I scary? No, I wouldn't say- Say, there's someone strange over there! Strange? Marin, that's not nice. Keep quiet. But he's funny! For him to wear his armor inside the train, he must really like it, huh? There's nothing particularly strange about us! There, you see? She likes you! Right? Pretty cool, huh? There now, Marin, that's enough already. Looks like they're tired out from too much romping around. Yes. I'm so glad that you've been able to travel like this without any incident, General Hakuro. They said that the situation to the east was unstable, but then, here we are. My, my, the higher-ups sure do take it easy. By the way, where is Maj. Hughes right now? He is communicating with Lt. Col. Mustang about that other matter. That other matter? Yes... Well, I hope so... So, you see... ever since my wife got pregnant, she's becoming more and more pretty... How should I put it? She's like an angel who has waltzed her way down to earth- Huh? We got cut off again. What lousy conditions for communications! I can't do anything with this! You're the one we can't do anything with! I'd better make another round if I'm going to keep myself from worrying. Hello? My, my... So, listen, what am I going to do if the baby is born tomorrow? Hughes... I've heard this story about fifty times now... If you want to talk about this, take it up with your wife directly! I have! Just a little while ago! Then don't ask me! Pardon me for breaking in. Major, a piece of advice... The baby won't be born after just five months! Huh? What was that? I can't hear too well over this phone. That's suspicious...! That's enough, Hughes. We just got confirmation that there's no one monitoring communications. So, how about it? Have you seen anyone suspicious? No. Or so I'd like to tell you. There have been more passengers getting on and off than anticipated. If you factor in the private rooms... What is it? They're here! They're here? They're here! Someone awfully suspicious! What! ? They're wearing armor this huge...! Armor? That guy is fine. Is there another pipsqueak together with him? Pip - ? He was right! He is here! And he really is little! Who are you calling so puny that you can only make him out under a magnifying glass! ? No, I was just... I'm not the one who said so... Be quiet! Everyone, get your hands up! W-why, you...! Good day, General Hakuro. Hey, Hughes! What is it? Has something happened? Hey, Hughes! Hey, inform Bald that we have taken the wireless! It doesn't look like anyone was using it, either! Is it them, after all? There's a call for headquarters from General Hakuro aboard the train heading for Central. It's an emergency. Put it through. It's me. Lt. Colonel? Is this Lt. Col. Mustang? This is Bald, of the Eastern Liberation Front "Blue Squad." We have taken control of this train. What are your demands? Don't play dumb! We suddenly lost contact with one of our allies today. Someone who was supposed to have delivered a statement to you. What are you talking about? Okay, fine. Bring our leader in Prison No. 8 to Central Station. We'll exchange prisoners there. Very well. In exchange, don't kill anyone. If you do- Are you sure about this? We do have a statement here, but if the general finds out, he's going to ask who was responsible. No problem. As long as the situation gets resolved, right? I've already taken sufficient measures. What is this man Mustang thinking? If he does anything funny, then it won't just be you! Consider all of the passengers dead! Brother... Yeah... Hey, you two... Why, you...! Hey, now that you've done that, what do we do? When their buddies come to get back at us for this... He's right. If you hadn't resisted, we probably would have gotten to Central without any trouble. He's right... What do we do? You're asking me? Are you all right! ? Yes... Sorry about that. Your big brothers will take care of this somehow, okay? Let's go, Al. Mm-hmm. Hey, you guys...! This is embarrassing. Who on earth are you? We're just ordinary alchemists. Really? I'm Falman. Warrant Officer. A soldier? You don't look at all like one! There's a reason why I'm dressed like this. You see, up in the first car... Then, that's who the criminals are after...? And they're dragging all the others into it! Al, I'll go at them from above. You take them from below, with this man. Mm-hmm. W-what? Hey! Come quick! There's something funny going on behind us! Ah! You'd better not shoot! I was about to tell you that you risked ricochets by shooting. What's going on! ? Ah! You'd better not shoot! Hey, Bald! Contact from behind us has been cut off! What's going on! ? So, you did have something set up, did you? G-give up, already. Turn yourselves over, and release the other passengers. Things just aren't going to go your way this time! Darling! We're the only ones giving orders here, General. Check all of the cars on this train again! And examine the outside of the cars, too! Hey, are you all right? I'm surprised you got this far. I'm Hughes. Edward Elric, right? Huh? Y-yes...! I heard about you from Lt. Col. Mustang. From the Lt. Colonel! ? Yeah. Now then, you'll work with me. I've already checked things out below us. What's the matter? Who are you-? There you are, there you are. Take this! Are you all right! ? What! ? Whoa, that was awesome! Hey, you! Don't mess around with the tender! It's the life of this train! Yeah, sorry! Tender, huh? You can't, Bald! There's someone outrageous up there! Bald! Contact with everywhere else has been cut off! They said something about a big suit of armor! Don't get excited! You guys in the criminal group. Can you hear me? What's... that? All right, you guys! Threaten everyone else, will you! ? Let the hostages go! Are you one of Mustang's secret agents! ? If you interfere, I'll kill the hostages, one by one! Oh, you're just itching to do it, huh? Well, then... A water... pipe...? Okay, hostages, please take cover! What! ? Welcome! All right, don't move. You're the ringleader, aren't you? What's the matter? Come on out. Damn...! Before I kill the general, I'll take care of you! Hold it! A fellow automailer, huh? A brat like you...? Is the military using even children now? You'll pay for that "brat" line! And I'm not being used by anyone! Kid, let me tell you something. I used to be in the military, long ago. At the time, I thought I wanted to be better armed. But the military didn't seem to like that idea. They were afraid of me becoming any stronger on my own. Shortly after I had this operation, they got rid of me. And so... and so... I wanted to crush the military! You understand, don't you? If you've got an arm like that, then you must have wanted it too! You wanted to be stronger than anyone else! No, I don't understand! And don't you lump my arm in... with yours! Good grief, that was something else. Don't kill anyone. That's what I told you. As it turns out, it looks like you did as you were told. You're Mustang, are you? A-awesome! I held back. The effect on your body probably isn't as bad as it looks. I am Roy Mustang. My rank is Lt. Colonel, and I am the Flame Alchemist. Remember that. He's Mustang... Brother! Lt. Colonel! Why, you... you knew about all of this when you had us get on this train, huh! ? It's not as if I had a grasp of everything. More importantly, though, I have good news. His generalship heard about your exploits, and he said he would specially allow you to take the State Alchemist Certification Exam. Specially? But, we came because you told us to take it...! There's no way a child could take such an important military test, you know. Now, aren't you glad that I had you take this train? Whether you take the test or not is still up to you. Of course we're going to take it! We'll take it, all right! Apparently, those people had us dancing right in the palm of their hand. But then, there was no way around it. We still don't have any power. There he is! Over here! Over here! Marin! Big brother, thank you! Thank you! Fullmetal Alchemist! Episode 6: "The State Alchemist Certification Examination" Everyone but me thinks it's impossible for Brother to pass. But then, on that day, miraculous flowers will bloom.

He was the original host of the children's television program "Blue's Clues". He continues to act and is a musician. In 2001 Burns was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for "Blue's Clues". Early career. Burns was born in Boyertown, Pennsylvania. He attended Boyertown Area Senior High School in Berks County and graduated from there in 1991. Burns played in bands called Sudden Impact US, Nine Pound Truck, and the Ivys (which he has called a "Morrissey rip-off band") while in high school and college. He studied theatre under an acting scholarship at DeSales University in Center Valley, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley. He dropped out of school and moved to New York City to then become a professional actor. He lived in a basement apartment near Times Square, finding his first success as a voice-over artist for ads and making appearances on "" and "Law &amp; Order". "Blue's Clues". In 1995, Burns auditioned for "Blue's Clues", thinking it was another voice-over role. He had long hair and an earring. "I was a bit of a skate rat," he said. Initially, the Nickelodeon executives were not supportive of Burns hosting their new show; in subsequent auditions the show's creators requested that he dress more conservatively. (Burns reported that the creators, in a call-back phone conversation, asked him, "Could you not look like yourself tomorrow morning?") It became apparent, however, that he was the favorite with preschool test audiences. Executive producer and co-creator Traci Paige Johnson reported that of the 100 people they auditioned, Burns was "the realest". As Dr. Alice Wilder, Nickelodeon's Director of Research and Development said, "[T]here was just something about this kid, who was fresh out of Pennsylvania, who just knew where to look in the camera to really talk to kids. He was just right." "Blue's Clues" was an instant hit, due to Burns' performances as much as the show's format. He became "a superstar" among his audience and their parents, but unknown to everyone else, and enjoyed what he called being a "micro-celebrity, about as small a celebrity as you can be." As the "New York Times" reported, he "developed an avid following among both preteen girls and mothers. The former send torrents of e-mail; the latter scrutinize the show with an intensity that might make even Elmo, the red Muppet, blush." In 2000, "People" magazine included Burns in their annual list of America's most eligible bachelors. According to writer Diane Tracy, Burns was "destined for the part". Also according to Tracy, Burns was not the typical children's television host: "There is nothing syrupy about him—his humor is sometimes borderline offbeat, but never inappropriate for preschoolers." Burns became "very involved" with the production of "Blue's Clues" from the beginning. One of the most challenging aspects of being the host of the show was performing in front of the "blue screen" before the animation was added. Burns called it "maddening" and likened it to "acting at the bottom of a swimming pool." Departure. After nearly six years and nearly 100 episodes, Burns departed "Blue's Clues" in 2002. According to Johnson, Burns never wanted to become a "children's host". He loved kids, but stated "he could not make a life-long career out of it". Burns went on by saying "I knew I wasn't going to be doing children's television all my life, mostly because I refused to lose my hair on a kid's TV show, and it was happening, fast". The day following the filming of his final episode for the show, he shaved his head. This was something he wanted to do for many years, but the show's producers would not allow it. On the FAQ section of his webpage, when asked why he shaved his head, and if he had been trying to make a statement, Burns replied, "Yes, the statement is, 'We have male pattern baldness.'" Burns's departure caused a resurface of the rumors that had circulated about him since 1998. Burns replied, "The rumor mill surrounding me has always been really strange." Some of these "specious claims" included: death from a heroin overdose, being killed in a car accident, and, like what was rumored to have happened to Paul McCartney in 1966, him having been replaced with a look-alike. After Burns' departure, the "Blue's Clues" actor was then replaced by Donovan Patton as Steve's younger brother "Joe". Burns made an appearance on "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" to dispute these rumors, and he and co-creator Angela Santomero appeared on "The Today Show" to help concerned parents extinguish the fears of kids who may have heard these rumors. In an interview with The Huffington Post in 2016, Burns addresses the rumors about his departure: "People think I left the show to pursue a music career. That didn’t happen at all. I left the show because it was just simply time to go. I was pretty much playing a boyish, older-brotherish kind of character on the show. I was getting older; I was losing my hair; a lot of the original people on the show, like the people who created it, were all moving on to other careers. It just felt like time. I just had a gut feeling like it was time to go." Burns still owns the original Thinking Chair, which his non-animated dog Mickey reportedly loves to sit on. Music and film career. Burns worked on material for his first album, "Songs for Dustmites", for two and a half years at a small studio in his home in Brooklyn before it was produced by PIAS Records in late 2002. He started work on the album after he left "Blue's Clues" in 2002, and it was later released in 2003. He posted eleven songs on his webpage, and then realizing he needed help with drums and arrangements went to Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips for advice. Drozd assisted Burns with six tracks, Lips bassist Michael Ivins engineered the album, and longtime Lips producer David Fridmann produced it. One of the songs from the album, "Mighty Little Man," is used as the opening theme for the CBS series "Young Sheldon." Burns started a band, Steve Burns and the Struggle, and completed his second album, "Deep Sea Recovery Efforts", which was released in 2009. Members of the Struggle include Drozd and Ryan Smith of A Million Billion. Burns acted in the 2007 horror-comedy film "Netherbeast Incorporated" with Darrell Hammond and Dave Foley, playing the part of a vampire.

The neighborhood includes a portion of the Santa Monica Mountains, which gives Sherman Oaks a lower population density than some other areas in Los Angeles. History. A partner of the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company, Gen. Moses Hazeltine Sherman, developed Sherman Oaks. The company had subdivided of land that would become Sherman Oaks. In 1927 each acre was sold for $780. Sherman's other major venture was the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad. In 1991, a group of homeowners living in the Chandler Estates area successfully petitioned former Los Angeles City Councilmember Zev Yaroslavsky to re-draw the boundaries of Sherman Oaks from Magnolia to Burbank Blvd to the north, and from Coldwater Canyon to Van Nuys Blvd to the west, with the goal of including their neighborhood. This request was not anything new to the San Fernando Valley; other neighborhoods had either sought to change their names, or sought to attach themselves onto more affluent neighborhoods to escape from what they saw as growing urban blight and the collapse of their social status. Residents in the area argued, however, that the area was originally part of Sherman Oaks, but was labeled Van Nuys instead through the creation of ZIP codes in 1962; some residents were able to produce a few property deeds to present their case. Just a few weeks after the Chandler Estates area successfully seceded from Van Nuys, Magnolia Woods, a 45 block area bordered by Van Nuys Boulevard on the east and the San Diego Freeway on the west, and between Burbank and Magnolia Boulevards, also successfully petitioned Los Angeles City council member Marvin Braude to secede from Van Nuys and join Sherman Oaks. Petitioners in the area argued that their neighborhood was also part of Sherman Oaks, though they were only able to produce 22 deeds showing so. As a result of this change, Van Nuys Middle School became separated from its namesake neighborhood. Finally, in 2009, the Los Angeles City council voted to redraw neighborhood boundaries again to allow an area of about 1,800 homes in Van Nuys to be included. This proposal attracted criticism from locals. The 1994 Northridge earthquake caused damages in the surrounding area. The Community Redevelopment Agency sought to manage the rebuilding efforts. The homeowners in the Sherman Oaks area later old, Antoine sang a French song at a party for her father, while her brothers and sisters sang Italian songs. She listened to and met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who was playing "marvellously" once, too. Mozart tried to propose to Antoinette. She would eventually be a fan of Mozart’s music. She was also famous for her beautiful dancing and the graceful way she carried her head. She had been officially taught by the famous French ballet master Jean-Georges Noverre. She was much less skilled at reading. Still, she loved her childhood home in Vienna and later missed it very much. She once said about her mother, "I love the Empress but I'm frightened (afraid) of her, even at a distance; when I'm writing to her, I never feel completely at ease (comfortable)." She disliked her sister, the Archduchess Marie "Mimi" Christine, who her mother seemed to love most. But her relationship with her sister Maria "Charlotte" Carolina was quite different: they loved each other warmly. They were very close, and a painter later said that they "resembled (looked like) each other greatly". Charlotte was more forceful, and Antoine was usually thought to be prettier. A Political Marriage (1767-1770). At the beginning of 1767 the Empress had five daughters with her. Marie Christine was already married to Prince Albert of Saxony. Elizabeth, who was very pretty, was 23, Amalia almost 21, Josepha was 16, Charlotte was 14, and Antoine was now 12. The Empress wanted Josepha, who was gentle and pretty, to marry Charles III of Spain. But then bad things started to happen. Her son Joseph's second wife died because of smallpox and was buried. After that Maria Teresa caught the smallpox and almost died. Then Maria Teresa took her daughter Josepha, who was about to begin her bridal journey to Naples, to go to the tomb of Joseph's wife to pray. But the tomb had not been closed tightly enough. Probably because of this, Josepha suddenly caught smallpox and died. Elizabeth also caught the disease. She lived, but her beauty was gone. Antonia, who had caught smallpox when she was two years old and become healthy again, did not catch the disease. But a bride was still needed for King Ferdinand of Naples. Maria Teresa quickly wrote a letter explaining what had happened to Charles III of Spain a month after Josepha died. "I grant of my daughters to make good the loss," she wrote. "I do currently (right now) have two who could fit, one is the Archduchess Amalia who is said to have a pretty face and whose health should other is the Archduchess Charlotte who is also very healthy and a year and seven months younger than the King of Naples." Soon, the King of Naples married Charlotte and Amalia was married to Louis XV's grandson, Don Ferdinand of Parma. Amalia was not happy with her mother's decision. The only daughter left was now Marie Antoinette. Empress Maria Theresa decided to use Antonia to make Austria become friendly with France. After long discussions, Antonia was engaged to Louis-Auguste, Dauphin of France. The duc de Choiseul from France and the Prince of Starhemberg from Austria helped arrange the wedding. They immediately began preparing Marie Antoinette for her marriage. Her teeth were crooked, but a French dentist came to fix it. After a painful three months, Marie Antoinette had a smile that was "very beautiful and straight". Her thick "mountain of curls" were dressed by Larsenneur, a famous hairdresser who powdered and softened her hair. Marie Antoinette also had a high forehead which was thought unfashionable at that time. though she had a long, graceful neck. Her education was also changed. In November 1768, the Abbe Jacques-Mathieu de Vermond went to Vienna to teach Antonia. She was clever, but without the knowledge a future queen should have. She was also lazy and unable to concentrate. She could not read or write properly in French or German, but a year after Vermond had arrived, she could speak it well enough. By the time she left Austria, she was speaking French easily and well, even if it had a small German accent. The Abbe also found that Marie Antoinette did not know much about French history, which they studied carefully together. In the end, Marie received a fairly good education. Death. Marie Antoinette was publicly executed by guillotine for treason in Paris, France, on 16 October 1793, months after the death of her husband. Her youngest son Louis-Charles, later died of tuberculosis and malnutrition during the revolution. She was buried in the Saint Denis Basilica. Her eldest daughter, Marie Therese, was the only one of their family to survive the revolution. = = = Montesquieu = = = Charles-Louis de third, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu (18 January 1689 – 10 February 1755), was commonly known as Montesquieu. was a French political thinker who lived during the Age Of Enlightenment. He is famous for his theory of the separation of powers in government. Many constitutions all over the world use it. He helped make the terms "feudalism" and "Byzantine Empire" popular. Political views. Before Montesquieu, the standard feudal system was called "the three estates": Montesquieu's work divided French people into three classes: three classes (or trias politica, a term he coined): These should be balanced, so that no one power would be able to overcome the other two, either singly or in combination. This was a radical idea because it eliminated the three estates structure. Montesquieu's ideas are important because they ended the feudalistic structure. They also helped inspire the constitution of many countries, including the United States. Some of Montesquieu's ideas are still controversial. He believed that women could be leaders in government. But he thought women could not lead a family. He supported a hereditary aristocracy and primogeniture. Hereditary means that the title passes from the parents to the children. Montesquieu describes an unusual idea in his essays "The Spirit of the Laws" and "Persian Letters". This idea is the climate theory. It says that climate, the weather of a place, influences the nature of man and his society. Montesquieu thought that some climates were better than others. He believed the mild climate of France is the best. He believed people from hot countries are "too hot-tempered". People in cold, northern countries are "icy" or "stiff." The climate in middle Europe therefore breeds the best people. (This view is possibly influenced by similar statements in "Germania" by Tacitus, one of Montesquieu's favourite authors.) Montesquieu's philosophy that "government should be set up so that no man need be afraid of another" prompted the creators of the Constitution to divide the U.S. government into three separate branches. = = = Aristocracy = = = Aristocracy is a kind of government that puts power in the hands of a small, privileged ruling class. In Ancient Greek, the word aristocracy means "the rule of the best", but it has come to be linked with rule by Nobility. A member of the aristocracy is an aristocrat. There are different kinds of aristocracy with different ways the government is set up. In history, most aristocracies are hereditary. Members of the ruling group have passed on power to their eldest surviving Child. In most cases, this was their son. Daughters were often excluded from this. Aristocracy can be combined with other kinds of government. There were small groups of people that run a country. The people were called aristocrats and often had titles such as duke, duchess, baron and baroness. Some good examples of this are the Spartiates in Sparta, the eupatridae in Athens, the patricians or Optimates in Rome to name a few = = = Poseidon = = = Poseidon () is the god of the sea, earthquakes, storms and horses in ancient Greek religion and myth. He was one of the Twelve Olympians. His parents were Kronos and Rhea. He was the older brother of Zeus yet not by much. Poseidon was generally regarded as an ill-tempered being. His mood was a reflection of the state of his realm. He was thought to conjure up violent storms at sea when angered. While he was married to the goddess Amphitrite, one of the Nereids, like his brother Zeus, Poseidon had a number of affairs with other goddesses and mortal woman, siring such heroes as Theseus and Bellerophon. Lord of the waters, Poseidon was both patron and protector of both sailors and seafarers, who would pray to him for safe passage across the sea. Poseidon was often regarded as the “Father of Horses,” as they were thought to be his creations. He was additionally the chief deity and patron of the city of Corinth, whereupon the Isthmian Games were held every other four years in his honor. Otherwise known as the Earth-Shaker (), Poseidon was thought to be the cause of such disasters, striking the Earth with his trident (a three-pronged spear) whenever he was particularly enraged. The god's symbol was his trident and the bull, horse and dolphin were his sacred animals. The god Neptune is his Roman equivalent. Neptune was a more war-like figure. He is named after the ship which sank by a tsunami. = = = Object-oriented programming = = = Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing computer programs using "objects" to stand for data and methods. Often, computer programs that are not object-oriented are a list of instructions for the computer, telling it to do certain things in a certain way. This is called procedural programming. However, in object-oriented programming, computer programs use objects that talk to one another to change the data in those objects and to work in a way that the user wants. Because of the way object-oriented programming is designed, it helps the developer by allowing for code to be easily reused by other parts of the program or even by other people. Most programming languages are a mix of different ways of writing computer programs (called programming paradigms). For example, Python allows for computer programs to be written both in object-oriented programming and in procedural programming. There are many programming languages that allow you to write computer programs in object-oriented programming. Some of these programming languages are: C++, Java, Ruby, Perl, Emarald, Sapphire, PHP, Python, C#, etc. Features. The main idea of object-oriented programming is that everything is an object. However, the object can be of different types: Objects is a term used to refer to instances of classes. Examples. In the examples below, we create a class called codice_1. This class contains the attributes codice_2 (for the name of the person) and codice_3 (for the name of the friend). Each of the methods in the codice_1 class contains a list of instructions that makes use of both the codice_2 and codice_3 attributes. Python. This code is in Python. class Human(object): def __init__(self, name, friend=None): self.name = name self.friend = friend def say_name(self): print(f"My name is {self.name}") def say_goodnight(self): if self.friend is None: print("Good night nobody.") else: print(f"Good night {self.friend.name}") stephen = Human("Stephen") joe = Human("Joe", stephen) stephen.say_name() # Shows 'My name is Stephen' stephen.say_goodnight() # Shows 'Good night nobody.' joe.say_name() # Shows 'My name is Joe' joe.say_goodnight() # Shows 'Good night Stephen' Java. This code is in Java. public class Human { private String name; // the name of this Human private Human friend; // the Human's friend // This constructor creates a new Human object when given the name and friend public Human(String name, Human friend) { this.name = name; this.friend = friend; // This constructor creates a new Human object when only given the name public Human(String name) { this(name, null); public void sayName() { System.out.println("My name is " + this.name); public void sayGoodnight() { if (friend == null) { System.out.println("Good night nobody."); } else { System.out.println("Good night " + friend.name); public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // Create a new Human object stephen with name "Stephen" Human stephen = new Human("Stephen"); // Create a new Human object joe with name "Joe" and stephen as a friend Human joe = new Human("Joe", stephen); stephen.sayName(); // Shows 'My name is Stephen' stephen.sayGoodnight(); // Shows 'Good night nobody.' joe.sayName(); // Shows 'My name is Joe' joe.sayGoodnight(); // Shows 'Good night Stephen' Criticism.

This is usually done by copying the data around. In an event-driven model, the recipient will then act in a certain way to the message. = = = Handball = = = Handball (also known as team handball, field handball or Olympic handball) is a team sport similar to football (soccer). Two teams of 7 players each (six players and a goalkeeper) pass and bounce a ball using the hands, trying to throw it into the goal of the other team. Games are an hour of playing time, divided into 30-minute halves, with 15 minutes break at halftime. The size of the court is a little bigger than a basketball court, 40 meters by 20 meters, which is the same court as indoor soccer. It has a six-meter line which no one but the goalie is allowed to have possession of the ball and touching the ground. If this happens, a foul is called and the player committing the foul gets ejected, (sitting out of the game for two minutes, five minutes, or the rest of the game). There are seven players total on a handball team, six players and a goalie.

Seventeen gods have been said to have been Olympians, but there were never more than twelve at the same time. Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Athena, Apollo, and Artemis are always considered to be Olympians. Hestia, Dionysus, and Hades are the gods who have sometimes been Olympians. Thus, it is theorised that Hestia gave up her place to Dionysus because she wanted to live amongst humans however no records of this actually exist The Olympians became the most important gods when Zeus and his brothers and sisters won a war against the Titans. Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Hestia, and Hades are all brothers and sisters. All the other gods are Zeus's children and have different mothers. = = = Sandro Botticelli = = = Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi ( – May 17, 1510), known as Sandro Botticelli (, ), was one of the greatest painters of the Florentine Renaissance. His The Birth of Venus and Primavera are often said to epitomize for modern viewers the spirit of the Renaissance. His most famous painting is Birth of Venus, however he does have a lot of famous artworks: Fortitude, Madonna and Child, Adoration of the kings and many more. His auction record tops 10 million. Sandro Botticelli was unique; he was influenced by the revival of Greek and roman ideas in Florence at the time, Botticelli was one of the first western artists since classical times to depict non religious subject matter Young Botticelli. Botticelli was born in Florence in the working-class "rione" of "Ognissanti". At first he did an apprenticeship to become a goldsmith. Following the boy's wishes, his doting father sent him to Fra Filippo Lippi. Lippi was working on frescoing the Convent of the Carmine. Lippi's synthesis of the new control of three-dimensional forms, tender expressiveness in face and gesture, and decorative details inherited from the late Gothic style were the strongest influences on Botticelli. Another influence were the Pollaiuolo brothers.They were doing a series of Virtues for the Tribunale or meeting hall of the Mercanzia. This hall was a cloth-merchants' confraternity.Botticelli contributed to this the "Fortitude", dated 1470 in the Uffizi Gallery. He was an apprentice too of Andrea del Verrocchio, where Leonardo da Vinci worked beside him, but he made his name in his local Church of Ognissanti, with a "St. Augustine" that successfully competed as a pendant with Domenico Ghirlandaio's "Jerome" on the other side "the head of the saint being expressive of profound thought and quick subtlety" (Vasari). In 1470 he opened his own independent "studio". Being discovered by the Medici. Lorenzo de' Medici was quick to employ his talent. Botticelli made consistent use of the circular "tondo" form and did many beautiful female nudes, according to Vasari. The "Birth of Venus" was at the Medici villa of Castello. Influences of religion on Botticelli. Sandro was intensely religious. In later life, he was one of Savonarola's followers. Botticelli burned his own paintings on pagan themes in the notorious "Bonfire of the Vanities". Earlier, Botticelli had painted an "Assumption of the Virgin" for Matteo Palmieri in a chapel at San Pietro Maggiore. In this painting, it was rumored, both the patron who dictated the iconic scheme and the painter who painted it, were guilty of heresy. People did not say what kind of heresy it was. The ideas that could be seen as heresy seem to be gnostic in character: This is a common misunderstanding. It is based on a mistake by Vasari. The painting referred to here, now in the National Gallery in London, is by the artist Botticini. Vasari confused their similar sounding names. Other influences. The "Adoration of the Magi" for Santa Maria Novella, ca1476, contains portraits of Cosimo de' Medici ("the finest of all that are now extant for its life and vigour"), his grandson Giuliano de' Medici, and Cosimo's son Giovanni, were effusively described by Vasari: In 1481, Pope Sixtus IV summoned him and prominent Florentine and Umbrian artists who had been summoned to fresco the walls of the Sistine Chapel. The iconological program was the supremacy of the Papacy. Sandro's contribution was moderately successful. He returned to Florence, and "being of a sophistical turn of mind, he there wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante and illustrated the Inferno which he printed, spending much time over it, and this abstension from work led to serious disorders in his living." Thus Vasari characterized the first printed Dante (1481) with Botticelli's decorations; he could not imagine that the new art of printing might occupy an artist. As for the subject, when Fra Girolamo Savonarola began to preach hellfire and damnation, the susceptible Sandro Botticelli became one of his adherents, a "piagnone" left painting as a worldly vanity, burned much of his own early work, fell into poverty as a result, and would have starved but for the tender support of his former patrons. = = = Hermes = = = Hermes is the "messenger of the gods". He is the god of winter, travellers and shepherds in Greek mythology. He is one of the Twelve Olympians, and is often shown with his caduceus. Hermes is the son of Zeus and Maia. He was born on Mount Cyllene. The story of his birth was told in the Homeric Hymn, which means "Hymn to Hermes". It said that Maia was a nymph. Hermes was very clever and on his first day invented the lyre, by using the shell of a tortoise. He carries a golden sword. One of the myths about Hermes is that he once stole his brother's oxen, and burned them as a sacrifice. = = = Maia = = = Maia is the goddess of the fields in Greek mythology. She is the oldest of the Pleiades. She is also the most beautiful and the shyest. The Pleiades were the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione. Maia and her sisters were all born on Mount Cyllene, which is in Arcadia. Maia was the mother of Hermes by Zeus, who is another god. She gave birth to Hermes in a cave in Arcadia. After Maia gave birth to Hermes she wrapped him in blankets and then went to sleep. When she woke up, Hermes had crawled away to Thessaly and had invented the lyre and stole some of Apollo's cattle. Maia also looked after Arkas when Hera had turned his mother, Kallisto, into a bear. = = = Pleiades (mythology) = = = The Pleiades are seven nymphs in Greek mythology, and companions of Artemis. They were the seven daughters of Atlas and the nymph Pleione. They were all born on Mount Cyllene, which is in Arcadia. = = = Medieval commune = = = Medieval townspeople in western Europe during the period of the High Middle Ages needed protection from lawless nobles and bandits. The walled city was protection from direct assault, but once a townsperson left the city walls, he or she was at the mercy of often violent and lawless nobles in the countryside. Because much of medieval Europe didnt have anything like a police force each city had to provide its own protection for citizens both inside the city walls, and outside. In order to do this towns formed what are called communes. Communes "were sworn allegiances of mutual defense". When a commune was formed, all participating members gathered and swore an oath together, in public, they would defend each other in time of trouble. In addition they would swear to maintain the peace within the city proper. What did it mean for a commune member to defend another? Obviously if a commune member was attacked outside the city it was too late to call for help as it would be unlikely anyone would be around in time. Instead the commune would promise to exact revenge on the attacker, the promise of revenge being a form of defence. However, what would happen if the attacker was a noble who had a castle, too strong for the townspeople? This was often the case and certainly the town commune could not gather the people to attack a castle. Instead they might attack the nobles family, or burn his crops, or kill his serfs, or destroy his orchards. It was eye for eye violent revenge. The commune movement started in the 11th century in northern Italy which had the most urbanized population of Europe at the time, and in what is now Belgium which was also relatively urban at the time. It then spread in the early 12th century to France, Germany, and Spain and elsewhere. England never saw much of the commune movement because it was by comparison a pretty well run kingdom and did not need local protection forces. Although in most cases the development of communes was connected with that of the cities, there were also rural communes, notably in France and England, that were formed to protect the common interests of villagers. The Church and King had mixed reactions to communes. On the one hand they agreed safety and protection from lawless nobles was in everyone's best interest. The communes intention was to keep the peace through the threat of revenge, and the Church was sympathetic to the result of peace. However the Church had their own ways to enforce the peace such as the Peace and Truce of God movement, for example. On the other hand, communes disrupted the order of medieval society. The methods the commune used, eye for an eye, violence begets violence, were generally not acceptable to Church or King. Normally only the noble lords are allowed to fight and the merchant townspeople were the workers, not fighters. There was a sense the communes were a threat to the medieval 3-tiered social order: Those who work, those who pray, those who fight. Communes crossed the line between working and fighting. As such communes were sometimes accepted, and other times not by the Church and King. One of the most famous cases of a commune being suppressed and the resulting defiant urban revolt occurred in the French town of Laon in 1112. = = = Imperialism = = = Imperialism is a policy (way of governing) in which large or powerful countries seek to extend their authority beyond their own borders. The policy of imperialism aims at the creation of an empire. Imperialist countries take control of other countries. They may use military force to do this. However, they may also avoid using military force. They may simply establish economic and/or political control over the other country. Imperialist policies of countries or kingdoms have goals of taking over more land to create bigger empires. The ruler of an empire gains natural resources such as agricultural and mining products. Human resources are also gained. Conquered peoples may be forced into slavery or into low-wage work. They may also be called into military service on behalf of the empire. Trade markets are also gained. The people under an imperial government may be forced to buy products from that government or from that government's industries. Thus, a policy of imperialism can vastly enrich the imperialist country. This benefit can extend over a long period of time. Imperialism has been practised throughout recorded history. However, there is one historical period that is specifically known as the Age of Imperialism. This period extends from the early 18th century to the mid-20th century. During the Age of Imperialism, modern and industrialised countries competed for control of pre-industrial parts of the world. In pre-industrial areas, natural and human resources were widely and cheaply available. The imperialist countries that acquired the largest empires during the Age of Imperialism are The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and the United States. Some writers use the term "imperialism" informally. They use the term to mean any type of domination of one country over another part of the world. Domination especially happened in Asia and Africa. = = = Heresy = = = Heresy is a word used by different religious groups, used to describe someone who has ideas that are different from what the religion or law teaches. Such a person is known as heretic. In the Middle Ages it was not uncommon to accuse someone of heresy. If the accusations could be proven, the culprit would go through a ritual. Since torture could be used, the accusations were often proven. The ritual was done to save the soul of the convicted criminal. It involved being burnt while tied to a post. Still in the 21st century Muslims who apostatize are often treated very harshly and frequently killed. Jesus Christ himself was regarded as a heretic by the Jewish leaders at the time- see Gospel of Matthew 26:57-67 The Roman Catholic Church in early times had great trouble with heretical christological doctrines, such as Monophysitism and Arianism. The Church sees several heresies in Protestantism: As a result of the Protestant Reformation, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was created in the Roman Catholic Church which protects the Church against heresies. It is the last instance to decide what constitutes a heresy, and how to deal with it. = = = Cossacks = = = The Cossacks () (from Cuman "cosac", meaning "free man") were a group of nomadic East Slavic Orthodox Christian warrior people originating in the steppes of Ukraine. They are famous for their sense of being free. They are also well known for their military skill, mostly as cavalry swordsmen and archers. The Ukrainian Cossacks first rose as a warrior group of East Slavic Orthodox Christian horsemen who took up a military tradition and eventually created a Cossack Federation in the steppes of Ukraine. They first rose up in the 15th century in response to the raids of Tatars and the conquests of the Ottoman Empire. During Ottoman occupation of the western bank of Ukraine, the Cossacks rebelled against the Ottoman Empire and were responsible for destroying Ottoman influence in the region. The Ottomans lost control over Ukraine and parts of Romania also due to the Cossack rebels and raiders. The Cossacks captured many Ottoman outposts in the Ukrainian steppes and created a Cossack Hetmanate ("state"). They sometimes served the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth forces and later fought against them, taking Ukraine. Thus, the Cossacks are considered in Ukraine to be the founders of modern Ukraine since they expelled the Ottomans and Polish from Ukraine and created an independent state for themselves. The name Cossack itself literally means "free man". The term was first used in the year 1395. The most well known Cossacks are the Ukrainian Cossacks from Zaporizhzhia and the Russian Cossacks (Kazaks) from Don, Terek, Kuban and Ural areas. They started after the Mongols attacked Kievan Rus. Eventually Russian Cossacks guarded land for the Russian government. Cossacks were in the Russian army in some wars throughout the 1800s and 1900s. They were mostly responsible for conquering land in Central Asia and the Caucasus for the Russian Empire. In behalf of the Russian Imperial Empire, they conquered lands as far east as Siberia and even in Alaska which they conquered. Alaska was later sold to the USA however the lands they conquered in the far east Russia such as Siberia are still part of Russia today making Russia the largest country in the world by land size. They conquered places in Caucasus too for example the rebellious states of Chechnya and Dagestan. They were also responsible for destroying many Turkic states in both the Caucasus and Central Asia due to their conquests for the Russian Empire. They subdued Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and were responsible for adding these states to the huge Russian Empire. They also invaded Armenia due to calls of support by the Armenians against the Ottoman Empire and in doing so, they conquered Azerbaijan and annexed both Armenia and Azerbaijan to their empire and defeated the Ottomans many times in northeastern Turkey. In the Russian Civil War most fought against the Red Army but some were "Red Cossacks" who fought on behalf of the Bolsheviks. In Soviet times, the Cossacks' life was subject to a lot of Bolshevik attacks and Cossack lands survived several famines. Cossack armies fought on both sides in the Second World War. In Russia today, Cossacks are ethnic descendants or are in the Cossack army and often both. = = = 41 = = = Year 41 (XLI) is a year in the 1st century. It was a common year starting on Sunday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Saturninus. = = = American Sign Language = = = American Sign Language (old names: Amslan, Ameslan ) is the most popular sign language for the Deaf in the United States, in the English-speaking parts of Canada, and in parts of Mexico. Although the United Kingdom and the United States share English as a spoken and written language, British Sign Language (BSL) is different from American Sign Language. ASL actually comes from French Sign Language, as Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet went to England for help learning sign language to teach to his deaf neighbors. He could not find anyone willing to teach him the British Sign Language, but did find some French people who were willing to help, he convinced one of them to travel back to the United States with him to set up the first deaf school in the U.S. ASL is also used (sometimes with other sign languages) in the Philippines, Singapore, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Chad, Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Mauritania, Kenya, Madagascar, and Zimbabwe. Like other sign languages, its grammar is different from any spoken language. ASL includes fingerspelling. Fingerspelling is a way to show the written letter. ASL uses one hand to show the English alphabet, although there are ways to show alphabets from other languages. Names of people and places can be fingerspelled. Fingerspelling is also used for words that have no sign, or for when people are confused about what a used sign means. Statistics. Counting the number of ASL speakers is difficult because ASL users have never been counted by the American census. ASL use in the general American population has not been directly measured. The ultimate source for current estimates of the number of ASL users in the United States is a report for the National Census of the Deaf Population (NCDP) by Schein and Delk (1974). Based on a 1972 survey of the NCDP, Schein and Delk provided estimates consistent with a signing population between 250,000 and 500,000. The survey did not distinguish between ASL and other forms of signing. Incorrect figures are sometimes cited for the population of ASL speakers in the United States based on misunderstandings of statistics. Demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use. This accounts for cited estimations which are greater than 500,000. Such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15,000,000. ASL is sometimes incorrectly cited as the third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States. These figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who said ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population "requiring an interpreter in court". = = = Sign language = = = A sign language is a way of communicating by using the hands and other parts of the body. It should not be confused with body language. Sign languages are an important way for deaf people to communicate. Deaf people often use them instead of spoken languages. Spoken languages use sounds from the mouth and are understood with the ears. Sign languages use hands and are understood with the eyes. Deaf people can use sign languages more easily than spoken languages. Language learning and use. Deaf people sometimes learn a sign language from their family, especially if their parents are deaf. But, most deaf children have hearing parents, so they learn a sign language from other deaf people. They may meet other deaf people at school or in the streets. Hearing people may learn to sign directly from deaf people. Or, they may learn a sign language by going to signing classes or by studying a sign language workbook, which can come with an interactive DVD. Sometimes deaf people do use a spoken language, especially when talking with hearing people. Sometimes hearing people use a sign language with each other, rather than speaking. But, deaf people tend to use sign languages, and hearing people tend to use spoken languages. Some deaf people can also understand spoken words by looking at a speaker's lips. This is known as lip-reading. It is hard to learn, and few people do it well. Sometimes signing and lip-reading are combined, especially when deaf and hearing people are talking to each other. History. Sign languages have always existed in deaf communities. In ancient texts we see authors commenting about deaf people and sign language. In the western world, the first studies dedicated to sign languages date from the 17th century. In 1620, in Spain, the priest Juan Pablo Bonnet published a text about teaching deaf people to speak, using gestures as a tool. The language of signs created by Bonet was used by Abbé Charles-Michel de l'Épée, to create a fingerspelling alphabet in the 18th century. This alphabet has changed very little since then, and is used with sign languages in many countries. The sign alphabet created by Charles-Michel de l'Épée, however, is not the origin of French Sign Language, the sign language that has influenced many other sign languages around the world. Even before Charles-Michel de l'Épée started teaching deaf people, they already used Old French Sign Language, and could read and write in French. This was a great advance, because it proved that deaf people could be educated and didn’t needed speech to think and learn. Different sign languages. Sign languages are not universal. That means there is not one single sign language for all deaf people around the world. There are many different sign languages. Each deaf community can develop its own sign language. Usually there is a different sign language in each country. Linguists have identified at least 137 different sign languages. Here are some well-known sign languages: However, sign languages are not totally independent from each other. Sign languages can develop from the same source. For example, ASL, LSM, and LSQ all developed from Old French Sign Language. They are part of the same language family. Sign languages can be similar to each other. BSL, Auslan, and NZSL are very much alike. Linguists sometimes talk about them as if they are one language. They call it "BANZSL" (an acronym for "British Australian New Zealand Sign Language"). Sign languages can influence each other. They sometimes copy signs from other sign languages, the same way spoken languages copy loanwords. Grammar of sign languages. According to the "American Heritage Dictionary", signing is "a language that uses a system of manual, facial, and other body movements as the means of communication, especially among deaf people." Sign languages have their own grammar rules: syntax, morphology, phonology and semantics. Sign languages are not simply mime. They are not gestures strung together without any rules. Sign languages are real languages. People sometimes also use the term "sign language" to talk about a "method of communication, as between speakers of different languages, that uses hand movements and other gestures." This article is about the earlier use of the term "sign language". It is talking about a real language that must be learned, not just a set of simple gestures that anyone can dream up to communicate. A sign language is not a way of encoding the sounds of a spoken language or the letters of an alphabet. For example, American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL) are not copies of English. They are different from each other, even though they are both used in countries that speak English. Sometimes sign languages may copy a few elements from a spoken language, but usually they are very different. For example, sign languages often use different locations in space around the signer to represent people or objects that are being talked about. These locations are used like pronouns in spoken languages. The main difference between sign languages and spoken languages is that sign languages use hand and body movements to form signs while spoken languages use sounds to form words. Really, each sign in a sign language is like a word in a spoken language. Both types of languages use grammar rules to combine words/signs into sentences. That's what makes them languages, and why both types of languages are different from mime or simple gestures. Spoken words are made up of smaller pieces: individual sounds like "p" or "o". In the same way, signs are made up of smaller pieces: handshapes, movements and locations of the hands, facial expressions and other body movements. These pieces are used in different combinations to make the signs in the language Some signs are made with only one hand, and others are made with both hands. Some signs include movements of the mouth or other parts of the body; without those other movements, the sign is not correct. Other body movements are also important in the grammar. For example, in many sign languages, raised eyebrows indicate a question that has a "yes" or "no" answer. The grammar rules of different sign languages are similar to each other, but they aren't the same. There is not a universal grammar for sign languages; each sign language has its own grammar. For example, sign languages use different handshapes to form signs; each sign language has its own set of handshapes. Sometimes a sign looks like the object or action it represents, but this is not always true. For many signs, a person just has to learn the meaning, like words in a spoken language. It's not easy to guess the meaning from what the sign looks like. This is another thing that makes sign languages different from mime; in mime, the meaning of a gesture is obvious, it doesn't have to be learned. However, signs aren't totally arbitrary either. Once a person knows the meaning of a sign, the form of the sign can often help remember the meaning. Fingerspelling. Besides normal signs, many sign languages use fingerspelling. Fingerspelling is also known as a "hand alphabet" or "dactylology". In fingerspelling, each letter in the alphabet of a spoken language has its own sign. Fingerspelling is a tool. People use it to spell names, acronyms and other words from spoken languages. Sometimes people do this when there is not a sign yet. Sometimes people use a fingerspelled word even when there is a normal sign for the same meaning. For example, when talking about a person, a signer might spell their name using fingerspelling. Or, they may use a "name-sign"—a special sign for that person. Fingerspelling is not universal. It is different in different sign languages. Two sign languages may have a similar fingerspelling system. Or, their fingerspelling systems may be very different. Some fingerspelling systems use only one hand. ASL uses a one-handed system. Other sign languages use both hands for fingerspelling. The BANZSL languages use a two-handed system. There are different fingerspelling systems for different writing systems. Japanese is written with different letters than English. This means fingerspelling in Japanese Sign Language is different from fingerspelling in ASL or BANZSL. ASL uses a lot of fingerspelling. Most sign languages use less fingerspelling than ASL. Some sign languages don't use fingerspelling at all. Writing sign languages. There is not any official way of writing signs. Some deaf and hearing people think there should be. Some have invented different ways of writing sign languages. Here are some of them. Other users of sign language don’t think writing signs is something useful. Usually, deaf people just write the spoken language in their country. They don't try to write the sign language. Sign languages in deaf culture. Deaf people have their own culture. It is similar to the culture of hearing people around them, but there are important differences. Deaf people have different experiences from hearing people. This makes their culture different. Sign language is the most important part of deaf culture. Through a sign language deaf people can create a social and cultural identity for themselves. They can communicate naturally with each other. The shared sign language helps hold their deaf community together. Hearing people use spoken languages to do the same things. Some children are born deaf. Others lose their hearing because of illness when they are very young. These children often learn how to sign and become a part of the deaf community and deaf culture. However, some people who are physically deaf do not participate in deaf community and deaf culture. Some people lose their hearing later in life. These people usually continue to interact with hearing people using a spoken language. They do not learn to sign. They do not make friends with deaf people who sign. They depend on hearing aids, lip-reading, or writing notes to communicate with their hearing friends. Some deaf children learn to speak and lip-read a spoken language. This is a difficult skill, but some children succeed. Also, some may have surgery to get a cochlear implant. A cochlear implant helps some deaf children hear better. It is not the same as normal hearing, but it can help them learn to speak. These deaf people can interact with hearing people using a spoken language. The term "deaf culture" usually refers only to the culture of deaf people who sign. = = = Saint-Dié-des-Vosges = = = Saint-Dié-des-Vosges is a city in the northeast of France, in Lorraine.

People also wear thin gloves made of rubber or plastic to keep things they touch clean. Some workers wear gloves made of heavy rubber to protect their hands from chemicals. A mitten is a glove which has a separate place for the thumb, but the other four fingers are together. There are also mittens, which are very similar to gloves.

Plot. This movie is about superheroes. Will Stronghold has two superhero parents. His dad, Steve, is The Commander, who is very strong. His mother, Josie, is Jetstream, who can fly. Will is expected to have great powers of his own, but he finds that he does not have any. He enters his school, Sky High, where the students are sorted into "hero" and "sidekick." Will is given the position of a sidekick and takes different classes than the hero track. He later tells his dad about this, who is not happy that his son will not be like him. At school, Will also has an enemy named Warren Peace. The Commander put Warren's father away for three life terms. During a lunch, Warren gets very mad at Will and starts throwing fireballs, which is his superpower. Will dives under a bench. It is here his power comes to him; super strength, like his dad. He manages to defeat Warren and both are put in a time out room where their powers do not work. His mother is not happy, but his dad is very happy that Will has powers. Steve shows Will the hiding place where the Stronghold family does all of their activities. Will's new powers put him up in the hero track, where he is partnered with a girl named Gwen Grayson. Will soon falls for Gwen and does not keep up with the friends he made as a sidekick. Will has an old friend named Layla, whose power is to grow plants. Will gets more popular. Gwen gets him to invite all the popular kids for a party. When Layla comes over to tell Will that she loves him, Gwen stops her and tells her that Will has new friends. Layla is upset. When Will learns about it, he breaks off the date. He was going to go to the prom with Gwen, but now decides to stay home. His parents go to the prom instead. There was going to be a ceremony to honor the best superhero of all time. During the prom, however, it is revealed that Gwen is really a villain named Royal Pain. The Commander thought he killed her off, but when he zapped her, she simply became a baby instead. The years passed and she grew into another teenager. Royal Pain puts on her suit and uses her weapon to make everyone become babies. Will comes on down to the school. He is very sorry for how he acted as a hero and tells his sidekick friends that he needs all of their help to beat Royal Pain. Lash and Speed, two bullies on Royal Pain's side, are knocked out. Ethan tricks Lash and stuffs his head down the toliet. Then he becomes a puddle of ooze, which causes Speed to slip. Warren, now on Will's side, throws fireballs to knock Speed down. Magenta, whose power is to become a rat, climbs into the system and tries to disable it, otherwise the school will fall from orbit and everyone will die. Penny, a cheerleader who can make multiple copies of herself, surrounds Layla. Layla does not want to fight, but when they hit her, she uses her power to make all the plants come out and bind the cheerleaders down. Will finds Royal Pain outside. She has loaded all the babies onto the bus and will retrain them to be bad people. He tells her to put his father down. They fight. Will is winning when Layla bursts in, distracting Will. Royal Pain manages to throw Will out of the window. All seems lost when Will appears in the window – he too has Josie's power of flying. He then kicks Royal Pain out of the window. The school begins to fall down. Will goes outside and uses his power to try to keep the school from hitting the ground. Magneta cuts the wire in time and saves the school from crashing into the ground. Steve and Josie give their award to all of the sidekicks that helped out. All of the villains re put into the time-out room. As Will and Layla become a couple, the final narration states that Ron Wilson became a superhero after falling into a vat of toxic waste, Will and Warren became best friends and Sue and her henchmen are now Will's archenemies. = = = Tales of Symphonia = = = Tales of Symphonia is a role-playing video game released in 2004 for the Nintendo GameCube.

Genis' sister Raine and the mercenary Kratos join them. While traveling, Colette begins to change into an angel. Lloyd learns that she is in charge of saving the world. Two groups of people want her to stop. They are the Desians, bad guys that enslave humans, and Sheena, a woman that wants to kill Colette. Sheena and Colette save each other from the Desians and become friends. Eventually, they get ready to save the world. Kratos betrays Colette and the others to Cruxis, the angels who control the Desians. Lloyd and the others manage to escape. They go to a different world called Tethe'alla. There, they make three new friends called Zelos, Presea, and Regal. Kratos still wants to find them and the Cruxis leader, Mithos, is very angry. Lloyd's group learns that if they want to save the world, they need to have Sheena gain the power of the eight "Summon Spirits". The spirits are magical creatures. After using the power of the summon spirits, the problem gets worse. Lloyd and Kratos need to work together to save the world from being destroyed by the Giant Kharlan Tree. Yuan uses a drug where it puts people to sleep on everyone. After this, Lloyd wakes up in the middle of the night. Kratos is with Yuan and two of Yuan's henchman. Lloyd learns that Kratos is his father. Kratos dives in front of Lloyd to stop him from being hurt. Kratos then tells Lloyd that there is a ninth Summon Spirit by the name of Origin. Lloyd has to fight Kratos to get its help because Origin was sealed by Kratos himself. The Summon Spirit helps Lloyd use the eternal sword. After this, they go to Derris Kharlan and there is one last battle with Mithos. = = = Protestant Reformation = = = The Protestant Reformation was a series of events that happened in the 16th century in the Catholic Church. Because of corruption in the Catholic Church, some people saw that the way it worked needed to change. People like Erasmus, Huldrych Zwingli, Martin Luther and John Calvin saw the corruption and tried to stop it. This led to a split in the church, into Catholics and various Protestant churches. The Protestant reformation triggered the Catholic Counter-Reformation. Martin Luther's posting of The Ninety-Five theses at Wittenberg is seen as the start of the Protestant Reformation. This happened in the year 1517. John Knox brought Luther's ideas to Scotland and founded the Presbyterian Church. As various countries adopted Protestant ideas, wars broke out between Catholic and Protestant factions and countries. Many people died in these wars, which included the Thirty Years' War and the Eighty Years' War. These wars were not just about religion. Since most countries have recognized (state) religion, many of the disputes were political. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 recognized Protestants when the signers agreed not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. This included their chosen religion. The recent invention of the printing press helped spread awareness of the Church's abuses. A start was made in translating the Bible into various local languages. For example, John Wycliffe and William Tyndale worked on translating it into the English language. Much of Tyndale's translation was used in the King James version of the Bible. Luther translated the Bible into German. Causes of Reformation. The start of the 16th century, many events led to the Protestant reformation. Clergy abuse caused people to begin criticizing the Catholic Church. The greed and scandalous lives of the clergy had created a split between them and the peasants. Furthermore, the clergy did not respond to the population's needs, often because they did not speak the local language, or live in their own diocese. The papacy lost prestige. However, the split was more over doctrine than corruption. The main points of criticism were: In 1515, the Pope started a new indulgence campaign to raise money for the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, a church in Rome. Preachers came to Germany to sell the indulgences, promising that money could release souls from purgatory. Martin Luther, a German Catholic monk thought this went too far. On October 31, 1517, he sent his 95 theses to the local archbishop in protest. It is said he nailed a copy to the door of a church in Wittenberg. These theses, written in Latin, were points that Luther wanted to debate. Most of them related to the problems caused by the sale of indulgences. Luther said that the idea that money could buy forgiveness prevented people from turning away from sins. He said that it also made people give less money to the poor. Luther did not attack the Pope. He blamed the abuses on others. Nevertheless, his ideas implied that the pope was corrupt also. Without Luther's permission, the 95 Theses were translated into German and sent to many places. Many people agreed with Luther. The Catholic Church tried to stop these new ideas, but without much result. Luther was considered an enemy of the Pope, and when he refused to change his ideas he was excommunicated (put out of the church). In the beginning, Luther had not planned to separate from the Catholic Church or to create a new religion; he wanted to reform the Catholic Church. Consequences. In many countries, Christians put the needed reforms listed by Luther into practice. People began to read the Bible in their own language, and many could see for themselves how the Catholic Church had let the Christian faith become corrupted. Many who stayed in the Catholic Church adopted some of Luther's ideas. The Pope reestablished the Inquisition to combat heresy. The Catholic Church responded to the Protestant reformation with the counter-reformation. Between 1545 and 1563 the Council of Trent met to decide what to do. Some of the worst abuses were eliminated but many of the old teachings were kept. The Inquisition tried to force people to keep those ideas. Finding force not very successful, the Pope created new religious orders like the Jesuits. These new religious orders were told to combat Protestantism by educating the population to Catholicism. The Pope made the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a list of banned books. It had a big influence in its first centuries and was not ended until the 1960s. The Catholic Church used baroque art to touch the religious feeling of the faithful and bring them to the Catholic religion. In addition to the conflict in the churches, there were political consequences. Common people were made more open to questioning their leaders. In 1524-1525, millions of peasants rebelled against the nobles in the name of equality of humanity in front of God. Many countries in Europe choose Protestantism as the state religion and so Europe was divided by religion. This brought religious wars such as the French Wars of Religion. For a short time, Protestant and Catholic had managed to live with one another and with the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. This Peace recognized the confessional division of the German states and gave the right to Protestants to practice their religion. Longer Term Impacts. Catholic countries such as Spain and Italy for a long time didn't allow Protestants to live there, and Protestant countries kept out Catholics. With the American Revolution the idea of freedom of religion began to expand. Protestants are influential in the United States and the English Canada. Quebec was a (formerly French) Catholic province of Canada. After the Seven Years War the British imposed the Quebec Act granting freedom of religion in Quebec, while including in Quebec some of the present day United States, for example Ohio and Michigan. Catholics were granted religious freedom in those areas. Protestant colonists saw this as one of the Intolerable Acts. In later centuries, many Protestant churches were established in the province of Quebec. Many Catholic churches began in Ohio and Michigan. Eventually most Christian countries allowed some religious freedom. Churches based on Reformation ideas have multiplied into different forms, especially in historically Protestant countries. Even in much of Latin America, which is historically Catholic, Evangelical churches, which follow many of the Protestant ideas have greatly expanded. In the 20th century, some countries still had state churches, but also allowed full freedom of religion. In these countries, conflict between Protestant and Catholic Christians have become less important. They have to work together to confront a more secular society. In 2016 Pope Francis praised Luther in a prayer service commemorating the 500th anniversary of the Reformation. In turn, some Protestant churches have embraced some Catholic worship traditions, and others have praised them for their stand on social issues. = = = Sermon = = = A sermon is a speech that a priest or other speaker gives during church service.

She studied English at Stanford University. She originally had no intentions of becoming a cartoonist, but after a few years she began submitting strips to The New Yorker but they were never picked up. She was then hired as a freelance copywriter for an ad agency in San Francisco. Whilst there she submitted her comics to the San Francisco Chronicle and they were published in the opinion and book review section. Her success at the Chronicle inspired her to begin submitting her work for syndication. In 1995, Price received a call from King Features Syndicate to request more samples of her work and by June of that year she was syndicated. Price was just 25 years old at the time which makes her the youngest cartoonist to achieve national syndication. Career. Price publishes her panels almost daily to her website named after her strip ("Rhymes with Orange"). The title is derived from the belief that no English word rhymes with orange. Price's panels often feature animals such as cats and dogs in lieu of humans and doesn't feature any reoccurring characters. Her strips's format is also unique in design. A typical Price comic features one long panel where the illustration and dialogue are found, and to the left is a smaller panel with the title of the strip and often a secondary punchline and smaller illustration. This setup has the reader going from right to left rather than the typical left to right found in most western comics. In addition to her website her work has also appeared in "Parade Magazine", "The Funny Times", "People" and "Glamour". Price has released several compilations of her work in books, one of those being "Hanukkomics" in which she gathered all of her comics about Jewish culture and holidays. Her inspirations for comics include "Dr. Seuss for the rhymes, Shel Silverstein for the clever word play and black-and-white illustrations, and "The New Yorker" cartoonists Roz Chast, Sam Gross and George Booth."

This opened up the idea to Price that women could do "funny drawings" too. Personal life. Price is an openly gay, Jewish woman who lives in Florence, Massachusetts with her partner, dog, and cat.

His early paintings were in the expressionist style. His later paintings were more abstract. His 1981 painting "The Death of the Bull" is held in the Museo de Arte Moderno y Contemporáneo de Santander y Cantabria. Umberto Pettinicchio was trained at the Brera Academy and in 1969 he began to exhibit in his first solo exhibitions, including at the Nuova Sfera, Milan, 1973 (curated by Carlo Munari), in 1977 at the Rome Triptych, in 1974 at Il Castello di Milano, in 1975 (edited by Raffaele De Grada). In 1976 Pettinicchio opened his Milan studio in via Bolzano, where he produced some of his important works with which he achieved international fame. In the 1980s, he was always present at the most important exhibitions (at the Salotto di Como in 1980, at Il Castello di Milano in 1981, at Il Mercante di Milano in 1982), and was also enriched by important Spanish exhibitions (Sargadelos, Barcelona, ​​1982 , Piquio, Santander, 1982, at the VIII Madrid Biennial, 1983). Style. The artist Umberto Pettinicchio has often dealt with the human figure in his pictorial research, initially in an expressionist style. Subsequently, his pictorial style becomes more and more abstract until finally reaching the Informal.

Ether is type of money which uses the Ethereum system to make sure that every person gets the right amount in every deal. Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Many people donated money to support the development of the system in what was one of the first initial coin offerings. The system came online on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins. In 2016, Ethereum split into two separate versions: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Ethereum has started implementing a series of upgrades called Ethereum 2.0, which includes a transition to proof of stake and aims to increase transaction throughput using sharding. Overview. "Ether" is a type of money that is "decentralized", which means that there's no company, bank or government that oversees it. Instead, it uses the "Ethereum" network of computers spread around the world, which keep track of every payment of ether. As in other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum keeps track of payments by using a blockchain, which is a growing registry of every payment. This blockchain is open for everyone to read, and it is spread across the network so that everyone can check what payments have been made. This also protects against hacking or theft of money from the system, because if the blockchain was to be altered in some computers then it would be noticed that it is not identical with the others. "Ether" is a form of cryptocurrency, which means that it is "decentralized", and also means that people can use it for payments without revealing who they are. Instead, people can use the Ethereum system by "addresses" (also called "keys") which they can keep secret from others. The Ether coin can be transferred between accounts and used as a payment mechanism. The Ether coin is mined and used as compensation to miners for verifying transactions. After bitcoin, digital currency ether is the second most widespread cryptocurrency. However, Ethereum – the blockchain platform that supports ether transactions – has a few technological advantages over the market leader. Whereas practically the only use for bitcoin is in monetary transactions, Ethereum offers the additional option of linking the transactions to contractual conditions in what are known as smart contracts. These are small computer programs that are executed when the relevant monetary transaction has been concluded or, conversely, that trigger a monetary transaction or data delivery once they have been executed. History. Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder of "Bitcoin Magazine" in late 2013. Ethereum was announced at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, in January 2014. During the conference, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and Anthony Di Iorio (who financed the project) rented a house in Miami with Buterin to develop a fuller sense of what Ethereum might become. In January 2018, Ethereum was the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, behind only Bitcoin. As of 2021, it maintained that relative position. In 2019, Ethereum Foundation employee Virgil Griffith was arrested by the US government for presenting at a blockchain conference in North Korea. On 27 August 2021, the blockchain experienced a brief fork that was the result of clients running different incompatible software versions. Ethereum's founding story and team are featured in the 2021 book "The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze." "The Cryptopians" focuses on the infamous 2016 DAO hack on Ethereum. During this hack, over 3.6 million ether–about 15% of all ether in the world at the time–was stolen.

During those days, the regular Army then called the Liberian Frontier Force (LFF), used to combine with units of the national militia to have joint parade on special occasions, such as Independence Day, Inauguration Day, etc. However, in 1954, the late Colonel Francis M. Dean, then Assistant Chief of Staff (G-2), recommended in his annual report to the Defense authority that a day be set aside by an act of the National Legislature to be styled and known as “Old Soldier Army Festival” a day on which units of the Liberian Armed Forces throughout the nation would assemble at their respective headquarters to jointly participate in field ceremonies of parades and other planned military exercises. Colonel Dean’s recommendation traveled through the necessary chain of command until it successfully reached the official desk of the late Commander-In-Chief, President William V.S. Tubman who, in turn, approved and submitted it to the lawmakers for legislative consideration. How February 11 Was Chosen As Armed Forces Day When the Liberian legislature met in session to consider colonel Dean’s recommendation for legislative enactment, it was suggested that choosing any month and date to be set aside as Army Festival would be inappropriate. Instead, a month and date with some historical events in which a member or members of the Armed Forces had performed some marvelous deeds in the supreme interest of the nation (Liberia) and its people. By so doing, members of the incoming generations of the Armed Forces would continue to celebrate this day under appropriate military exercises in honor and remembrance of the heroic deeds of their comrades in arms. Moreover, this suggestion was embraced with popular support. However, the only event that could quickly come to the minds of the lawmakers was the month and date of the Major Mckay Cadell incidence in 1909. Major Cadell was the first commandant of the Liberian Frontier Force who carried on mutiny action against the Liberian Government during President Arthur Barclay’s administration, that aggression of Cadell was repelled by the first militia regiment headed by Ltc. Isaac Moart and his deputy Major. Joseph Dennis in 1909 having reached a unanimous consensus on the month and date of Major Cadell’s event, of February 25 1955, an act of Legislature was passed, declaring May 9 of each year as Armed Forces Day with a proclamation that it should be officially observed throughout Liberia as a National holiday. When the Act was proclaimed on May 9 as the month and date of the Major Cadell’s incidence, historians everywhere disagreed and argued that the incidence occurred on February 9, 1909. This argument in turn created a demand for legislative amendment. Consequently, on March 22, 1956, amendment was made, deleting May 9 and inserting February 9 in the Act as Armed Forces Day. Less than a year after the amendment was made, some survivors of the Major Cadell’s incidence declared that it was February 11, 1909. Once more and finally, on January 26, 1957, the appropriate rectification was made in the Act. Major Cadell was a British officer brought to Liberia from Sierra Leone to command the Liberian Frontier Force, and with him were some Sierra Leonean soldiers whom he incited against the Liberian Government for salary arrears. The Liberian Frontier Force thwarted their mutiny action and they were given twenty-four hours to leave Liberia.

BMW offered to buy Williams outright. They wanted to gain overall control of its Formula One efforts. Frank Williams would not sell the team. BMW chose to buy the rival Sauber team instead for and end its deal with Williams. BMW Sauber. BMW bought Swiss team Sauber in June 2005 to form the BMW Sauber F1 Team. The takeover came after BMW's relationship with Williams had deteriorated in the previous months, the partnership ending at the end of the season. The team was based at Sauber's headquarters in Hinwil, Switzerland and BMW's headquarters in Munich, Germany. The team scored two podium finishes and came fifth in 2006, its first season in Formula One. This was followed by a second place in 2007 after the McLaren team had been excluded from the championship. Polish driver Robert Kubica took the team's only Grand Prix victory at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix. Following a poor season, BMW withdrew from Formula One and sold the team back to founder Peter Sauber. 2006. For the 2006 season, BMW Sauber signed Nick Heidfeld from Williams to be the lead driver, while World Champion Jacques Villeneuve had his existing two-year contract with Sauber honoured. Robert Kubica was signed as the team's third driver. The team continued to use Sauber's facilities, mostly for chassis construction and wind tunnel testing, while BMW's headquarters in Munich were responsible for building the new 2.4 litre P86 V8 engine, revised technical regulations forcing a change from the 3 litre V10 formula. This replaced the Petronas-badged Ferrari engines which the team had used since 1997. The Sauber team's existing major sponsors, Petronas and Credit Suisse, renewed their contracts with BMW. The team also announced a technical partnership with technology company Intel. The team's new livery, which was maintained throughout its tenure in Formula One, consisted of the traditional BMW blue and white with a hint of red. Villeneuve scored the team's first points with a seventh-place finish at the Malaysian Grand Prix, after Heidfeld retired from fifth with an engine failure late in the race. Over the first two thirds of the season the drivers picked up points with a succession of seventh and eighth-place finishes, plus a fourth-place finish for Heidfeld at the Australian Grand Prix. The team ran a radical "twin towers" aero enhancement on the front of the car for the French Grand Prix, which was meant improve the flow of air over the top of the chassis. The parts were promptly banned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) as they were adjudged to impede the drivers' vision and thus compromise safety. Heidfeld scored the team's first podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix from tenth on the grid. This race also saw the début of Robert Kubica, who replaced Villeneuve after the latter had crashed heavily at the preceding German Grand Prix. Kubica finished seventh, although he was later disqualified after his car was found to be underweight. The official reason for Villeneuve's absence was that he was recovering from his previous accident, but the team later announced that the driver change was permanent. Kubica scored BMW Sauber's second podium finish of the season at the Italian Grand Prix, after running in third place for most of the race and leading briefly during the first round of pit stops.

On 19 October 2006, BMW announced that Robert Kubica would partner Nick Heidfeld for the 2007 Formula One season with Sebastian Vettel taking the test and reserve driver role. Timo Glock was later signed as the team's second test driver. The team launched its 2007 car, the F1.07, on January 16, 2007. The new car showed promising form throughout winter testing, topping the times sheets on occasions. However, team principal Mario Theissen declared some reliability concerns before the season's opening race in Australia. Kubica retired from fourth place with a gearbox problem, but Heidfeld took over the position and held it to the end of the race. In the early races of the season, Heidfeld and Kubica scored a series of points finishes and established BMW Sauber as the third-fastest team, behind Ferrari and McLaren. Theissen also made the point that the performance gap between BMW Sauber and the two top teams was less than the gap between BMW Sauber and the teams behind it. The Canadian Grand Prix brought mixed fortunes for the team. While Heidfeld scored BMW Sauber's best result thus far with a second-place finish, Kubica suffered a huge crash that resulted in a long safety car period. The media was initially told Kubica had broken his leg, but it later proved that he had escaped with only a sprained ankle and concussion. Vettel took his place in the United States Grand Prix, finishing in eighth place and therefore becoming the youngest driver to score a Formula One World Championship point. Later in the season, Vettel moved teams to take a race seat at the Toro Rosso team. Kubica returned to racing action at the French Grand Prix and proved his recovery by finishing in fourth position. Over the remainder of the season, he and Heidfeld continued their form to score a total of 101 points, which secured the team second in the Constructors' Championship after McLaren's disqualification. Heidfeld scored another podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix and scored 61 points to Kubica's 39, while Vettel's sole appearance produced an additional point. 2008.

It made its track debut at Valencia the next day, with Robert Kubica driving. Team principal Mario Theissen set the target of the team's first win. BMW Sauber started the season well with Kubica narrowly missing out on pole after a mistake in his main qualifying lap in Melbourne. He later retired after being hit by Kazuki Nakajima but Heidfeld finished second. Kubica took second in Malaysia, with Heidfeld in 6th setting the fastest lap of the race. The team's points total of 11 was their largest score up to that time. In Bahrain, Kubica scored his and the team's first ever pole position, beating Felipe Massa by just under three hundredths of a second. The team went on to finish 3rd and 4th in the race, equalling their highest round points total and promoting them to first place in the constructors' championship for the first time. The team also attained a second-place finish in the Monaco Grand Prix with Robert Kubica, beating both Ferraris and only trailing the McLaren of Lewis Hamilton by three seconds. BMW Sauber's first race victory came in the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, the team achieving a one-two finish with Robert Kubica's first race win and Nick Heidfeld taking second place. The victory came after Lewis Hamilton collided with Kimi Räikkönen in the pitlane, ending the race for both drivers. Kubica was on a different refueling strategy from Heidfeld, who also briefly led the race before securing the one-two finish for BMW Sauber in comfortable fashion. After the team's breakthrough win, development was switched to the 2009 season where new regulations come into play. This greatly annoyed Kubica, (who was leading the championship after the Canadian Grand Prix), as he felt they could have had a realistic chance of taking at least one title. The lack of development was reflected with a drop of form throughout the second half of the season, causing BMW to be outpaced by Renault, Toyota and even Toro Rosso (who started the season as one of the slowest teams) by the end of the season. Despite this, Kubica remained with an outside chance of taking the drivers championship until the Chinese Grand Prix, the 17th round out of 18. In October the team confirmed that they would stick with Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld as their drivers for the Season. 2009. Although BMW Sauber targeted the season as the year they would challenge for the title, their start to the season was a disappointment. Kubica was running in 3rd place in the opening round when he collided with Vettel while battling for 2nd place and was forced to retire. Heidfeld then secured the team's first podium of the year in Malaysia, but after 6 races BMW Sauber had collected a mere 6 points, and occupied 8th place in the Constructors' Championship out of 10 teams. A raft of upgrades were set for Turkey, including an improved regenerative braking system (KERS) and a double deck diffuser. While the new diffuser was implemented, the KERS could not be made to fit the new car and both drivers raced without the device. After the qualifying session for the British Grand Prix Mario Theissen announced that the team had decided to halt further development KERS; of which BMW had been one of the strongest proponents, and focus instead on improving the car's aerodynamics. This left Ferrari and McLaren as the only remaining users of the KERS system. In the European Grand Prix at Valencia Robert Kubica scored the team's first points since the race in Turkey. Following a meeting of the BMW board on July 28, the company held at press conference the following morning in which it confirmed the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the end of 2009. Chairman Dr Norbert Reithofer described the decision as a strategic one. The Formula One Teams Association released a statement in response pledging its support to help the team remain in F1. On 15 September 2009 it was announced that BMW Sauber had secured a buyer, Qadbak Investments Limited which said to represent European and Middle Eastern interests. However Lotus had been given the 13th and final slot in the 2010 Championship. The team were awarded what was termed a 14th entry, which hinges either on another team dropping out or all the other teams agreeing to allow 28 cars to enter the 2010 Championship. On November 22, Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung revealed that Qadbak's attempt to purchase the team had failed as it did not have the necessary funds. Qadbak turned out to be a shell company with no assets and no investors behind it. On November 27, 2009 it was announced that Peter Sauber would repurchase the team conditional upon the team receiving a FIA entry for the 2010 season. The FIA subsequently granted Sauber an entry on December 3. The team used Ferrari engines in . The team retained the BMW Sauber name for the season, despite using Ferrari engines. = = = List of Interstate Highways = = = Primary Interstate Highways are the major interstate highways of the United States and have a one or two-digit route number. "Even" (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8) route numbers are given to east/west routes, with the smaller numbered routes in the south (I-10) and bigger numbered routes in the north (I-90). Similarly, "odd" (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9) route numbers are given to north/south routes, with the smaller numbered routes in the west (I-5) and the bigger numbered routes in the east (I-95). Routes that end in a 0 or a 5 are major routes in the system. These Interstates generally go from coast to coast or from the bottom to the top of the U.S. For example, Interstate 5 goes from the Mexican Border at San Diego, California to the Canadian Border at Blaine, Washington. Likewise, Interstate 10, the southernmost cross-country Interstate Highway, goes from Santa Monica, California on the west coast to Jacksonville, Florida on the east coast. The longest Interstate Highway in the United States is Interstate 90. There are five sets of numbers that are used more than once throughout the system; the highways whose numbers are used more than once are separated by big distances to avoid confusion. Below, these are made separate from each other by West and East. Three-digit Interstates are spur or loop Interstates that usually are in big cities and areas outside of cities. The last two digits of a three-digit Interstate are always the number of the route it is related to. If the first digit is "odd" (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), the Interstate is usually a spur route while if the first digit is "even" (2, 4, 6, 8, or 0), the Interstate is usually a loop route. Primary Interstates. A total of 69 primary Interstates are in the table below, with 43 of them having three-digit routes. The lengths in the table are as of December 31, 2013.

The Interstate Highways in the island of Oahu, Hawaii are signed with the normal Interstate shield, with the letter "H-" added before the number. They are fully controlled-access routes built to the same standards as the Interstate routes in the main part of the United States. These are marked and considered interstates. Alaska and Puerto Rico. The Federal Highway Administration gives money to four routes in Alaska and three routes in Puerto Rico under the same program as the rest of the Interstate Highway System. However, these routes do not have to meet the same standards as the Interstate routes in the main part of the United States. Note that these are not marked and considered as interstates, but state and territory highways. Alaska. Alaska's Interstates do not have signs to mark them, although they all have state highway numbers that are not the same as the Interstate numbers. Puerto Rico. Like Alaska, Puerto Rico signs its Interstates as territorial routes, and the numbers are not the same as their official Interstate designations. Many of the territory's routes are freeway-standard toll roads. = = = Andrew Gaze = = = Andrew Barry Casson Gaze (born 24 July 1965) is a famous Australian basketball player.

He won the 'rookie of the year' prize in 1984. He scored the most points out of everyone in a season 14 times. This was because he was very good at shooting, including 'three-point' shots. Gaze played with Lanard Copeland at the Melbourne Tigers for most of his career. He often through 'alley oop' passes to Copeland. Gaze helped the Tigers reach the finals almost every year. He also helped them win two championships. Gaze played in the Olympic Games for Australia in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996 and 2000. In 2000 he became only the third basketball player to play in 5 Olympic Games. He led the team to 4th place at the 1988, 1996 and 2000 Olympics.) He was chosen to be the flag-bearer for the Australian team at the opening ceremony at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He has scored more points at the Olympics than any other player. He is the second-highest scorer of all-time in World Championship play. In 1988–99, Gaze played for a season college basketball at Seton Hall. His team reached the 1989 NCAA finals. They lost in overtime to Michigan. He tried out with the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics, but did not make the team. In 1993–94 he played seven games for the Washington Bullets. He also played with the San Antonio Spurs in 1998, but became hurt at the end of the season. The Spurs won the title and Gaze was given a championship ring. After the Sydney Olympics, Gaze retired from playing overseas. He retired from the NBL on May 12th 2005. He had played for more than 20 years. Soon after, he wrote his autobiography, "A Kid, a Ball, a Dream", with help from Grantley Bernard. Nowadays, Gaze often takes part in TV advertisements.

He was nicknamed "The Flying Dutchman" because he was German and very fast. He played in the National League from 1897 to 1917. He played for the Louisville Colonels for two years, and then for the Pittsburgh Pirates for 17 years. Wagner won eight batting titles, the most in National League history. He held the league record for slugging percentage six times, and the record for stolen bases five times. He was inducted (added to) the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936. He was one of the first five members of the hall of fame. He received the second-highest vote total to be added. Ty Cobb is the only person to get more votes. Babe Ruth tied with Wagner for second-highest. Most historians think that Ty Cobb is the greatest player of the dead-ball era. But some think that Wagner was a better all-around player. Most baseball historians think that Wagner was the greatest shortstop ever. Cobb said that Wagner was "maybe the greatest star ever to take the diamond." Early life. Johannes Wagner was born on February 24, 1874 in the Chartiers neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Chartiers is now part of Carnegie, Pennsylvania.) His parents were Peter and Katheryn Wagner. His father was a coal miner and his mother was a housewife. Both of his parents were German immigrants. Wagner was one of five children. His mother called him Hans as a child. This name evolved (change into over time) into Honus. When he was 12, Wagner dropped out of school to work in the coal mines with his father. In their free time, Honus and his brothers played sandlot baseball. They became so good that three of Honus's brothers also became professional baseball players. Honus's older brother, Albert "Butts" Wagner, was a professional baseball player. In 1895, he was playing for the Inter-State League. He got Honus a tryout with the league. In 1894, Honus married Bessie Baine Smith. They had three daughters: Elva Katrina (b. 1918), Betty Baine (b. 1919), and Virginia Mae (b. 1922). Minor league career. Honus started playing for the Inter-State League in 1895. He played for five different teams in his first year. The towns he played for were Steubenville, Akron, Mansfield, Adrian, and Warren. Ed Barrow, a manager from the Atlantic League, saw Honus play. He convinced Honus to come play for the Paterson Silk Weavers of Paterson, New Jersey. In 1896, Wagner had a batting average of .313. In 1897, Wagner played 74 games and hit .375. = = = Klaipėda = = = Klaipėda is a city in Lithuania. It is where the Nemunas River flows into the Baltic Sea. Klaipėda is the third largest city in Lithuania and the capital of Klaipėda County. The German name of the city is Memel. Until 1920, this city was the northernmost city of the German Empire. The city's history is complicated. The Port of Klaipėda is important in the area. It is a usually ice-free port on the Baltic Sea. It has been controlled by the Teutonic Knights, the Duchy of Prussia, the Kingdom of Prussia, the German Empire, the Entente States, Lithuania, and the Third Reich. The city became part of Lithuania while it was a Soviet Socialist Republic. Klaipėda remained part of Lithuania after it again became independent state. The population shrank from 207,100 in 1992 to 177,823 in 2011. Popular seaside resorts found close to Klaipėda are Nida to the south on the Curonian Spit, and Palanga to the north. = = = JIT = = = JIT, Just-In-Time compilation is a way to translate bytecode instructions to instructions the processor understands. Bytecode is a set of computer instructions for a processor that only exists on paper. The alternative to a JIT is an interpreter that looks at each bytecode instruction individually and then decides what to with it. When you run over the same part of the program again, an interpreter has to make the decisions again. While a JIT makes the decisions on how to handle the bytecode once, and then stores it as native processor instructions (this takes memory). Properly deciding how to translate bytecode take some time, so you have some minor slowdown in startup speed.

It ranks below the George Cross. It is only awarded for non-combat acts of bravery. The GM was created on 24 September 1940 by King George VI. At this time, during the height of The Blitz, there was a desire to reward acts of civilian courage. It was decided that the George Cross and the GM would recognise civilian bravery in the face of enemy action and brave deeds more widely. Announcing the new award, the King said: The Warrant for the GM was published in the "London Gazette" on 31 January 1941. The medal is granted in recognition of "acts of great bravery". The GM was originally not issued posthumously, but the warrant was amended in 1977 to allow posthumous awards, several of which have been subsequently made. The medal is primarily a civilian award, but it may be awarded to military personnel for gallant conduct that is not in the face of the enemy. As the Warrant states: Bars are awarded to the GM in recognition of the performance of further acts of bravery meriting the award.

Scallops live in all the world's oceans. This is one of the largest families of living bivalves. There are over 300 living species of scallop. Their main adaptation is the ability to swim by clapping their valves together. In this way they escape from most of their predators. They have a good reputation as a food source. As bivalves they have one hinged shell; each half is known as a valve. The lower valve is usually white (about 95%). It can also be orange (4%) or Lemon Yellow (1%). The name "scallop" comes from the Old French "escalope", which means "shell". Their shells can be up to 15 centimetres (6 inches) across. Main features. 1. Their ability to swim. However, a few species attach to rocks as adults by a filament. Most species lie on sandy beds, and swim off when touched by a starfish or other predator. 2. They have eyes round the edges of their mantle. Their eyes cannot see shapes, but they can detect changing patterns of light and motion. The scallop eyes fringing the edge of its shell detect moving objects as they pass successive eyes. 3. Semi-circular ridged shape to the shell. The valves are similar, and fit closely together to make a tight-fitting shell. 4. At some stage in their lives, all scallops all have a ridge of tiny teeth near the notch where the byssus comes out in other bivalves. This is called the "ctenolium". Its importance is that only scallops have it, and it can be seen in fossils. So that tells palaeontologists when they have a fossil scallop. Muscles. Scallops have a central adductor muscle. This is the same as true oysters (family Ostreidae). The inside of their shell has a scar in the middle. This shows where this muscle attaches to the shell. The adductor muscle of scallops is larger and more developed than the adductor muscle of oysters. This is because they swim. Food and digestion. Most scallops are filter feeders. They eat plankton. The plankton sometimes has scallop larvae in it. Siphons bring water over a filtering structure. Mucus then traps the food. Next, the cilia on the structure moves the food to the mouth. Then, the scallop digests the food in the stomach and digestive gland. Waste goes through the intestine and exits through the anus. Life cycle. Some scallops, such as the Atlantic bay scallop "Argopecten irradians" do not live for a long time. Others can live 20 years or more. One can estimate their age from the annuli, the concentric rings on their shells. The scallop family is unusual because of the variety in arrangements for sexual reproduction. In some species, a scallop has only one sex. They are either male or female. Other species are hermaphrodites so a single scallop has both male and female reproductive organs at the same time. A few scallops are male when they are young and they become female when they grow older. Red roe comes from female scallops. White roe comes from males. Scallops release Spermatozoa and ova freely into the water during the mating season. Fertilized ova sink to the bottom. The immature scallop hatches after a few weeks. The larvae drift in the plankton until they go to the bottom again to grow. They may attach by means of byssal threads. Fossil record. There are many Pectinidae species, living and fossil. True Pectinidae (ones with a "ctenolium") first appeared in the Upper or Middle Triassic over 200 million years ago (mya), and perhaps as early as 240 mya. The Pectinidae family had a large number of species in the Mesozoic era, but they almost disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous period. The survivors evolved rapidly during the Tertiary period. There are nearly 7,000 species and subspecies for the fossil and recent Pectinidae. Evolution. The evolution of bivalves that swim is a consequence of the so-called "Mesozoic marine revolution". In the Mesozoic era sea-floor predators evolved various new forms which fed on the abundant shellfish (brachiopods and bivalves). These predators are still abundant today: they are mostly the starfish, the gastropods, and the crabs. Each predator has its own methods. Crabs break the shells by force. Some gastropods make holes in the shell and put in a paralysing or relaxing substance; others work on small cracks in the edge of the shell. Once they get their proboscis in, they eat the shellfish. Starfish are the most common predators. The shells of brachiopods and bivalves are held together by strong muscles. What the starfish does is clamp hold of them on either side with its tube feet, and apply a steady pull. The starfish, with its muscles and hydraulic system, can pull for much longer than any bivalve muscle can withstand. Apparently, ten minutes are usually enough to open the shell a bit. Then the starfish slips its stomach inside the shell. The stomach can get through a slot as narrow as 0.1mm. The starfish then dissolves the mollusc where it lives, absorbing the nutrients. Consequently, there was a great reproductive advantage for any prey which had even the slightest defence to these predators. Many shellfish developed extra-tough shells. Some burrowed into the sand. Scallops must had had some elementary movement, which developed rapidly under selection. They became extremely common in the Mesozoic. There are some other methods used by a few scallops. "Chlamys hastata" often carry sponges on their shell. It is a kind of mutualism. The sponge makes it difficult for starfish to get their tube feet on, and camouflages "Chlamys hastata" from predators. When scallops move off the sand they are open to new predators such as rays, which patrol just above the ocean floor. They may also be picked up by seabirds which open shells by dropping them on rock. Evidently the main advantage lies in getting away from the starfish, which are very numerous on inshore and continental shelf habitats. Origins. Studies have shown the Pectinidae family is monophyletic, developing from a single common ancestor. The direct ancestors of Pectinidae were scallop-like bivalves of the family Entoliidae. As food. Wild fisheries and aquaculture. The largest wild scallop fishery is for the Atlantic sea scallop ("Placopecten magellanicus") off northeastern United States and eastern Canada. Most of the rest of the world's production of scallops is from Japan (wild, enhanced, and aquaculture), and China (mostly cultured Atlantic bay scallops). In 2005, China accounted for 80% of the global scallop and pecten catch, according to a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) study. Cooking. Scallops are popular in both Eastern and Western cooking. They have two types of meat in one shell. The adductor muscle is white and meaty. The roe, called "coral", is red, orange or white and soft. In Western cuisine, scallops are often served as an appetizer or starter. Some of the most common ways to cook them are sautéed in butter (especially with garlic), or breaded and deep fried. They can also be added to pasta, and are often served as Valentine's day meals. The byssus (also called the beard) is often tough. It is usually discarded or used later on for stock. Sometimes, markets sell scallops already prepared in the shell, with only the adductor muscle. Outside the U.S. the scallop is often sold whole, and people eat the adductor muscle and roe. In Japanese cuisine, scallops may be served in soup or prepared as sashimi or sushi. In a sushi bar, "hotategai" (���, ��) is the traditional scallop on rice. "Kaibashira" (��) might be scallop, but it can also be the adductor muscle of any kind of shellfish, such as mussels, oysters, or clams. In Cantonese Chinese cuisine dried scallop is called conpoy (���, ��, ��). Symbolism. Shell of Saint James. The scallop shell is the traditional emblem of James, son of Zebedee. It is popular with pilgrims on the Way of St James to the apostle's shrine at Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Fertility symbol. Throughout antiquity, scallops and other hinged shells have symbolized the feminine principle. Many paintings of Venus, the Roman goddess of love and fertility, included a scallop shell in the painting to identify her. This is clear in Botticelli's classically inspired "The Birth of Venus" Use as a design. Heraldry included the scallop shell symbol as a badge for people who had made the pilgrimage to Compostela. Later it became a symbol of pilgrimage in general. Winston Churchill's family coat of arms includes scallops. However, symbols in heraldry do not always have the same meaning. Sometimes no family member has been on a pilgrimage but there are still scallops on the coat of arms. Over 45 communes of France have one or more scallop shells on their coat of arms. The U.S. state of New York has had the Atlantic bay scallop as its state shell since 1988. In design, "scalloped edges" or "ridges" means a wavy pattern which reminds people of the edge of a scallop's shell. Shell petroleum company has had a logo with a scallop shell on it since 1904. = = = QWOP = = = QWOP is a Flash game created by Bennett Foddy and released on the Internet in 2008 to his website called "Foddy.net". Players play as an athlete named "Qwop", who is participating in a 100-meter sprint event at the Olympic Games. Using only the Q, W, O and P keys, players must control the movement of the legs to make the character move forward. When the player has successfully reached 50 meters they must jump a hurdle, and at 100 meters the player is encouraged to perform a long jump, although simply passing the finish line is sufficient to complete the game. The game has been criticized for being too hard to get good at. In early December 2010, the game had a viral popularity outbreak after video blogger Ray William Johnson reviewed a YouTube video that annotates the game, becoming the subject of an Internet meme. Despite this, the game helped Foddy’s site reach 30 million views.&lt;ref name = "https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/start/no-pain-no-gain"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of the game, Foddy created another flash game called "GIRP", which was released on his site in 2011.&lt;ref name = "https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/start/no-pain-no-gain"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; = = = Aga Khan IV = = = His Highness Karīm al-Ḥussayni Shah, Aga Khan IV KBE (born 13 December 1936) is the 49th and current Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims. He has held this position under the title of Aga Khan since 11 July 1957, when, at the age of 20, he succeeded his grandfather, Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan. He is responsible for the interpretation of the faith for his followers and helps to improve the quality of their lives and communities. Unlike his grandfather, the present Aga Khan's higher education was in the United States at Harvard University. His children have also been educated in the U.S. Since he became imam, the Aga Khan has followed the political and economic changes which have affected his followers. These events included the independence of African countries from colonial rule, the expulsion of Asians from Uganda, the independence of Central Asian countries such as Tajikistan from the former Soviet Union and the continuous turmoil in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Aga Khan is interested in the elimination of global poverty; the advancement of women; the promotion of Islamic culture, art, and architecture; and promoting pluralistic values in society. He is the founder and chairman of the Aga Khan Development Network, one of the largest private development networks in the world. This works for the environment, health, education, architecture, culture, microfinance, rural development, and disaster reduction. Goals include promotion of private-sector enterprise and the revitalisation of historic cities. During his visit to India in 1983, the Aga Khan said, The Aga Khan has been married twice, and has four children. His main residence is a vast walled compound and chateau, the Aiglemont estate near Chantilly, France. His Highness has many awards. Especially notable are the Nishan-e-Pakistan, Pakistan's highest civil award (1983), and the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. The Aga Khan is the first Muslim to receive this honour (1977). = = = Jesse Jackson = = = Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr. (born October 8, 1941) is an American church minister, activist and politician. Jackson was born Jesse Louis Burns, in Greenville, South Carolina. His mother, Helen Burns, was 16 years old at the time he was born. She never married his father, Noah Louis Robinson. When Jackson was two, his mother married Charles Jackson. Jesse was raised by his grandmother Matilda until he was 13. In 1957, he returned home when his step-father adopted him. Early life and civil rights. After he graduated from high school, Jackson had an offer to play professional baseball from the Chicago White Sox. He also received a scholarship to play college football at the University of Illinois, which he accepted. He later transferred to North Carolina A&amp;T. He was one of Martin Luther King Jr.'s main organizers in Chicago for the Southern Christian Leadership Conferences. After King was shot, Jackson formed several civil rights organizations of his own. Two of these were Operation PUSH and the Rainbow Coalition. Jackson was also active in civil rights movements outside the United States. He also served as a Baptist minister. Presidential runs. Jackson ran for President in 1984 and 1988, coming in second in the 1988 Democratic party. Both times, he ran on a very liberal platform that wanted people of all races to co-operate, as well as more emphasis on education, urban issues and infrastructure. He wanted to be chosen as the Democrat's Vice-Presidential nominee, but Lloyd Bentsen was chosen instead. From 1991 to 1997, he was a shadow senator from the District of Columbia. People thought Jackson might run against Bill Clinton in the 1996 primaries, but he did not. In 2016, during the 2016 United States presidential election he endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. In 2020, during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he endorsed Bernie Sanders to be the democratic nominee. Controversy. He is known for saying some things that are controversial. Some things he said were offensive to Jews. He also said that Barack Obama was "acting like he's white" and "talking down to black people." Personal life. Jackson's eldest son, Jesse Jackson Jr., is a former congressman from Illinois. His other son, Jonathan Jackson, is a congressman from Illinois as well. In November 2017, Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In August 2021, Jackson and his wife were hospitalized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, with COVID-19. = = = Structured program theorem = = = The structured program theorem is a theorem in programming and computer science. A computer program can be split into pieces of code that do a certain task. According to the structured program theorem, these smaller tasks can be combined in only three ways to get any larger task done. A program gets a large task done by splitting it into many smaller tasks that the computer can do easily. These smaller tasks are called "subprograms" in computer science. According to the structured program theorem, the three ways subprograms can be combined are: The theorem was first published in 1966 by Corrado Böhm and Guiseppe Jacopini. It comes from the 1946 description of the von Neumann architecture and the normal form theorem developed by Stephen Kleene. = = = Lower Triassic = = = The Lower Triassic is the first of three epochs of the Triassic period. It lasted from about 252.2 million years ago (mya) to ~247.2 mya. The Lower Triassic is the oldest epoch of the Mesozoic era. These rocks were laid down just after the great Permian–Triassic extinction event. The Lower Triassic was called the Scythian stage, which can be found in older literature. In Europe, most of the Lower Triassic is composed of sandstone. It is a lithostratigraphic unit of continental red beds. They were formed on land under desert conditions. Fauna. The massive extinctions that ended the Paleozoic era caused extreme hardship for the surviving species. Many types of corals, brachiopods, molluscs, echinoderms, and other invertebrates had completely disappeared. The most common hard-shelled marine invertebrates were bivalves, gastropods, ammonites, echinoids, and a few articulate brachiopods. The most common land animal was the herbivorous synapsid "Lystrosaurus". The earliest Triassic faunas lacked biodiversity and were like that throughout the epoch. Recovery on land took 30 million years. The first ichthyosaurs evolved in this epoch. The largest ichthyosaurs known come from the Triassic. The climate during the Lower Triassic (especially in the interior of the supercontinent Pangaea) was generally dry. Deserts were widespread. The poles had a temperate climate. The relatively hot climate of the epoch may have been caused by widespread volcanic eruptions. On land, the plants included the lycophytes, the dominant cycadophytes, ginkgophyta (represented in modern times by "Ginkgo biloba"), ferns, horsetails and glossopteris. = = = Middle Triassic = = = The Middle Triassic is the second of three epochs of the Triassic period. It lasted from about 247.2 million years ago (mya) to ~237 mya. Once the middle series in the Triassic was known as the Muschelkalk. This name is now only used for a unit of rock strata of Middle Triassic age, found in western Europe. Fauna. Archosaurs were initially rarer than the therapsids which had dominated Permian terrestrial ecosystems, but they began to displace therapsids in the Middle Triassic. This 'Triassic takeover' may have contributed to the evolution of mammals. It forced the surviving therapsids and their mammalian successors to live as small, mainly nocturnal insectivores. Nocturnal life probably forced the proto-mammals to develop fur and higher metabolic rates. In their burrows, keeping warm, looking after the young and feeding them with milk were keys to their later success. The ancestors of crocodiles, and the ancestors of pterosaurs and dinosaurs, were the most important archosaurs of this epoch. In the Tethys Ocean, the first sauropterygia were present, the nothosaurs and early plesiosaurs. Ichthyosaurs had arrived in the Lower Triassic. = = = Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi = = = Shahāb al-Dīn Yahya ibn Habash as-Suhrawardī (, also known as Sohrevardi) was a 12th-century Persian poet, philosopher and Sufi.

It was designed by Dr. Ferdinand Porsche. When it was introduced, it had gone through over a million miles of testing - more than any other car at the time. The history of the car is the history of the Volkswagen company - the company was created to make that car. Other than some military vehicles during WWII, it was the only car the company made at first. The car was made from 1949 to 2003, over 23 million of them. For many years, it held the record as the most-sold car ever. It took the record from the Model T Ford in 1971, and held it until 2000 when the Toyota Corolla took it away. The basic shape and design of the car did not change. It was also powered by an engine in the rear, had a small trunk up front, and was air-cooled (no radiator). More recently, the company made the New Beetle, which looked similar, followed by the present-day Beetle from 2012. These are completely different cars however, since they have a water-cooled engine in the front, and are very similar underneath to the Volkswagen Golf. There are many Volkswagen clubs around the world, the members restore or modify the original air-cooled Volkswagens.

Mechnikov was a protozoologist who became better known for the discovery of macrophages in 1882. He discovered how they dealt with germs by phagocytosis. Macrophages are found in virtually all tissues, and patrol for potential pathogens by amoeboid movement.

Ehrlich directed a research program which discovered the first treatment for syphilis which worked. It was a compound of arsenic which went by the trade name of "Salvarsan". He studied trypanosomiasis and other protozoal diseases. He produced trypan red, which was (as his Japanese assistant Shiga showed) effective against trypanosomes. He invented a staining system for bacteria (before Gram staining). He did a complete survey of all the cell staining techniques then known. He showed how to tell the difference between different kinds of white blood cells, and discovered mast cells. He discovered that methylene blue, which stains bacteria and cell nuclei, could put the malarial parasite, "Plasmodium", into recession (the fever drops). He also made a decisive contribution to an antiserum against diphtheria, and developed a method for standardizing therapeutic serums.

The miners refused to pay a licence fee to look for gold. The miners said that the money for the licence was a tax, and that if they had to pay tax then they should be represented in the parliament. Irish miner Peter Lalor became the leader of the miners. They built a fort, or stockade, on Bakery Hill above the gold diggings on the Eureka gold lead. They were attacked by the British Army. More than 30 people were killed. The battle went for 20 minutes. Flag. The miners made their own flag which was flown at the Eureka Stockade. The flag was torn down during the battle and taken away by one of the soldiers. It was given to the Ballarat Art Gallery in the 1890s. Pieces of the flag were sometimes given to important visitors to Ballarat. It is believed that Queen Elizabeth II has a small piece. In the 1973 the flag was restored and put on display at the Art Gallery. The display was opened by the Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam.

The character was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and voiced by Jack DeSena. In the film version, "The Last Airbender", in which is his name is pronounced differently, the character is played by Jackson Rathbone. In the Netflix , he is played by Ian Ousley. In the show, 15-year-old Sokka is a warrior of the South Pole's , a race of people who can control water. He, along with his younger sister Katara, discovers an Airbender named Aang, the long-lost Avatar, and accompanies him on his mission to win the Fire Nation and bring peace to the world. Concept and creation. Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko said that Sokka was originally designed to be "much" more low-key, but when his comedian voice actor Jack DeSena came in and brought liveliness to his character, they began writing towards that strength. Much of Sokka's dialogue and actions are derived from improvisations and intentional exaggerations on DeSena's part that the writers chose to include within scripts. As a result of his design, Sokka's character has come to serve as a source of comic relief during the series, often a victim of visual slapstick. He also is extremely sarcastic. History. Sokka grew up in his village and trains the warriors of his village. Forced to mature quickly when his mother Kya was killed in a Fire Nation raid, he cultivated his warrior skills with a militant zeal, while his sister Katara did chores and practiced waterbending. When Sokka was thirteen, his father and the other village men left to help the Earth Kingdom to fight against the Fire Nation, leaving him and his sister to look after their tribe with their grandmother, Gran Gran. As the oldest male left in the South Pole, Sokka came to assume a semi-leadership role by the time he was sixteen, fiercely protecting the village from any possible outside threats while trying to train children to be a new generation of defenders. While on an expedition, Katara and Sokka discovered Aang inside an iceberg with Appa. After Katara freed him, Sokka initially believed that the Aang might be a Fire Navy spy, and he eventually grew xenophobic enough to banish him from the village. Upon discovering that Aang was the Avatar, destined to master all four elements and bring peace to the world, Sokka relented, realizing that they had a common enemy in the Fire Nation. He then set off with Katara and Aang on their journey to find a waterbending master at the North Pole, determined to hone his warrior skills by way of fighting Firebenders along the way. Fire Nation general Zhao killed Tui (the moon spirit) causing the moon to turn red and then vanish as during a lunar eclipse, thus preventing the waterbenders from using waterbending. Princess Yue (one of Sokka's love interests, the other being Kyoshi warrior Suki) then becomes the new moon by giving her life energy to the moon spirit, thereby restoring the moon in the sky and the abilities of the waterbenders. In "Sokka's Master" (the 4th episode of ) Sokka expresses self-doubt that he is not as useful to the group as his companions. Inspired by his friends' encouragement, he seeks out a master to learn the sword. Rather than fighting with brute force and flawless technique, Sokka's creativity and heterodox approach to things are the cornerstones of his technique, and his master claims that in time Sokka will be a superior swordsman. As he departs, his master gives him a game piece that was previously established as a sign of connection to the secret society known as the Order of the White Lotus. In the two-hour , Sokka and Katara meet with Katara's Waterbending master, Pakku, who has now married their grandmother. In the battle against Ozai, Sokka, his girlfriend Suki, and Toph destroyed a Fire Nation airship and use it to destroy others of its kind while Aang duels with the Phoenix King (Ozai). Sokka and Toph are separated from Suki and attack another airship, but Sokka breaks his leg and strains his arm grabbing hold of Toph, who was falling off the ship. In a compromised position, the pair are attacked by two soldiers, whom Sokka defeats at the cost of his sword and boomerang. As he and Toph are on the edge of the crashing ship, Suki arrives with another airship and saves the two. With the battle over, the trio reunite with Aang and the vanquished Phoenix King. At Zuko's coronation, Suki is reunited with her fellow Kyoshi Warriors, Sokka and Katara are reunited with their father, with the rest of the group reunited with their friends. In the end, Sokka is seen at Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se where everyone teases a painted picture he created of the entire team, wherein he altered some factual details to make the scene more "memorable". Other media. In the live-action movie The Last Airbender by M. Night Shyamalan, Sokka is played by Jackson Rathbone. His name is pronounced "So-kah," but in the show it's name pronounced "Sah-kah". Several important changes to the character's personality were made. In the film he is no longer the comic relief, nor does he exhibit any inventive abilities or usefulness in battle. He rarely shares screen time with Aang, the main hero, or contributes in any way to the plot. M.

Besides, it may also cover design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles or any other objects where structural functionality or safety are involved. Structural engineers must ensure their designs satisfy building codes. Major structural engineering projects go through the following four stages: "research", "design", "testing", and "construction" which are featured with the images below: Structural engineering came to existence when the humans first started to construct their own structures. It became a more defined profession with the emergence of the architecture profession during the industrial revolution in the late 19th Century. Entry-level structural engineers may design individual structural elements of a structure, for example, beams, columns, and floors of a building. More experienced engineers would be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system, such as a building. Structural engineers often specialize in particular fields, such as bridge engineering, building engineering, pipeline engineering, earthquake engineering, industrial structures, or special mechanical structures such as vehicles or aircrafts. = = = Abbécourt = = = Abbécourt is a commune.

B: I mean, uh, uh, the only way that you're going to have peace over there, if, if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them, B: you know, until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but I don't think we want to make that decision either. A: No. B: So that's, that's a little rough, you know, B: we're not, we're not quite up to that sort of thing. A: No. B: So A: Well, I guess I better go A: I have a repairman just came, for my refrigerator, B: Oh B: Oh, well, that's, that's fun. A: But, A: Yeah. A: Well, I enjoyed the topic. A: I hope you have a good day. B: You too. A: Okay. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Okay. B: Hi, B: I, uh, I like, I love to do, uh, all kinds of crafts and sewing, B: I, I find that's my one release A: Uh-huh. A: Um, I like to do like physical things like sports. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, I really enjoy softball A: and my favorite is volleyball, B: Uh-huh. A: and, but, I'm at school, A: I'm in, you know, A: I I live up at the college, So sometimes it's hard for me to do that, B: Uh-huh. A: so I just, like sometimes, A: I like, just to get away, A: I go to my room and I like walk in, turn the radio on, or, you know, just kind of like veg out or something. B: Uh-huh. B: Well I have two small kids B: and so, I, I don't have, you know, much time to, to go places and play sports, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: I have to do something where I can do it at home. B: So, I'm, uh, I just love to sew B: and, uh, you know, I I make a lot of my Christmas presents, A: Uh-huh. B: and I love to do all kinds of crafts and stuff like that. A: I like to do that stuff, but when I'm in, like when I'm at school, I don't have time to do it or even time to learn how to do it. B: No, B: I remember when I was in college, B: I didn't have time to do that stuff either. B: It was really, A: Yeah. B: But now, you know, I don't have a whole lot of time now but I have more time than I did, B: so. A: Uh-huh. B: And a lot of my sewing I kind of do out of necessity, you know, B: for, B: you know, I've got two kids to put clothes on, B: so. A: Yeah, A: exactly, A: uh-huh. A: Like, um, I have, I come from a family of twelve children, B: Oh. A: and when I'm up here, I really miss my younger brothers and sisters, A: so you know, that's, that's a change, because there's nine of them that are younger than me. B: Uh-huh. A: I'll call like when I know my mom and dad aren't home, I'll call home just to talk to my little brothers and sisters. A: I, I really miss them a lot A: so I don't, A: I guess talking on the phone is one of my hobbies too. B: Yeah, B: I, B: yeah, B: I just, uh, have, you know, one brother and he's married, B: and, you know, they have a couple kids, B: so I, you know, I don't have, uh, you know, I don't get on the phone too much. B: But, yeah B: most of my stuff is just going B: you know I enjoy going places with my kids B: and I do like sports, but I'm, you know, I don't have a lot of time for them. B: My, B: I like volleyball. B: Of all sports, I think that would be my favorite, because I hate basketball A: Yeah, A: well, I'm not much of a basketball fan either. B: I enjoy playing volleyball but I, you know, I, I don't have a lot of time to do it, B: so. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. B: It's maybe once a year or something B: an, B: and then I, you know, used to play it a lot when I was in school, B: but now that I'm married and stuff I, you know I've like, I'm really bad. B: Nobody would want me on their team. B: I'm the, you know, I'm the opposing teams best player, so, so to speak, B: so. A: Uh-huh. B: But, yeah, B: I enjoy, um, you know, just, B: I, you know, I have varied interests and stuff B: and yeah, B: so. A: Yeah, A: um, not that I like reading, but I do do a lot of reading while I'm here at school. B: Uh-huh. A: Do you like reading as a hobby? B: Uh, I love to read, but I, you know, I don't have a lot of time to read an, You know, what reading I do, I kind of do because it's, you know, it's the necessary stuff A: Yeah. B: as far as fun reading, you know, I maybe get to read the Sunday paper, but, that's about it, you know, B: so. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I don't have a lot of time to read. B: I, yeah, I remember in college, I did a lot of reading, most of it text books, B: so. A: Uh-huh. B: And, just, B: you know keeping busy with everything else going on, B: so. But yeah, B: I, I like to do, uh, B: I've made stuffed cows, you know, dress, you know, dolls, B: they're like dolls, A: Uh-huh. B: you know, you make clothes for them and everything like that. A: Yeah. B: They, those have been real popular with my family. B: I've had them calling up and saying, will you make me another one B: and, so, I do things like that, you know, B: if I had more time, I'd probably do it and sell the stuff B: but, you know, I don't have enough time to do it to really, you know, take orders on it, A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. B: you know, it's like I can only do it when I have time. B: I have a whole stack of material and patterns to sew up as it is, B: so. A: Do you, um, A: I know one thing that's pretty popular with the girls up here at college, and I make them also, is the padded covered photo albums? B: Oh yeah, B: uh-huh, B: I do, B: I've done those too, before, B: yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: Those are real, B: I, I have a several of those that I've made like as wedding gifts, you know. B: I made them out of all lace and, and satin, you know, and made them as wedding gifts and stuff like that, B: so. A: Yeah. B: Those are real popular, B: in fact, I got some of those for my wedding, B: so. A: Uh-huh. A: I know they're real popular here at school, also. B: Uh-huh, B: yeah, B: yeah, B: those are fun to do, B: and just little things, you know, B: I, I didn't have a lot of, B: when I was in college I did, you know, I did sewing for other people when I had time, you know, B: like if somebody needed a bridesmaids, maids dress made, I'd make that, B: but that's about all the sewing I did, B: I never had time for, you know, to sew myself a new dress or anything like that B: so, but, yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: I just kind of sew for my kids B: and that's about it, B: so. B: Well, I guess maybe we've covered the topic, pretty good. A: Yeah. A: I really don't have any other. B: Yeah, B: I'm not too much, uh, you know, B: I don't have a lot of hobbies, B: mine are just mostly, you know things I just do out of necessity. A: Uh-huh. B: Okay, B: well, it's been nice talking to you. A: It was nice talking to you too. B: Good luck in school. A: Thanks. B: Bye, bye A: Bye, bye. A: All right, A: do you do garden work? B: As little as possible. B: I'm a college student A: Uh-huh. B: so if I do any garden work, it's only when I go home in the Summer. A: Oh, where do you go to college? A: Where's that? B: It's about two hours north of Pittsburgh. A: Oh, okay. B: Yes. A: Yes. A: Well, do you, you know, do you do gardening at home? B: Yeah, B: we go home, B: well, we have a large family, B: there's twelve kids in my family. A: Oh my goodness. B: So, like almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden. A: Hm. B: So we have a pretty good size garden A: Yeah, A: well I guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest B: But we have like a lot, B: like my mom likes flowers, so we have a lot of flowers too. A: Yeah. A: I had a whole bunch of flowers and things. A: Well, I don't have as many now. A: We lived in the country for a long time, B: Uh-huh. A: and I had a whole bunch. A: But now, I work and I live in the city so, that sort a kind of hung it up. A: I have a few flowers, but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that. B: Uh-huh. A: And this year I decided that, A: well my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it, A: but I decided that I don't like grass, A: I don't like to have to have to pull grass B: Uh-huh. A: so I decided that I would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot and see how it worked. B: Uh-huh. A: And mine looks real good B: You know, I've seen a lot of people that do that. A: Yeah. B: I've seen, you know, like elderly people that really can't get out too much sometimes. A: Uh-huh. B: Like we, B: I have a great aunt that lives in a, B: it's just like, uh, a high rise for elderly people. B: And, you know, she does her own thing and everything, B: but she has, B: it's like a little apartment building. B: And she has a tomato plant year round. A: Oh. B: Because she, you know, B: they keep it warm with, for all the older people, B: and she keeps it year round. A: I had never thought about that. A: I could probably plant one and bring it in, and just like I bring my plants in every year. A: That'd be neat. A: Well, I got a patio, A: and I tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots And planting them all in it, you know, because that's favorite thing, is tomatoes to grow. B: Uh-huh. A: And so, um, but he said, No, A: he was going to plant in the earth, you know, like he always has, A: because he's always had a garden out in the country. B: Uh-huh. A: And I think he kind of misses it a little bit, you know, since we moved to the city. A: But, um, I went ahead and planted one, and mine looks better than his A: It does, A: and then I like, um, A: you know what day lilies are? B: Pardon me? A: Day lilies. B: Are they, well, B: do they just come out in the morning then go A: Uh-huh. B: but we call them Morning Glories up here. A: No, A: no. A: Huh-uh. A: These look like a lily. A: They look like a, a, well, they really look like an orchid when they come out. B: Oh really. A: Uh-huh. A: That what the look like, A: but they only bloom for one day. B: Oh. A: They'll, um, A: you'll have a bud the evening before, A: and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it, it it starts opening up A: and then when it gets dark, it closes A: and that's it. A: It only blooms for one day. B: And then it's done, completely done. A: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: Yeah. A: But, um, they look like orchids, is what they look like, A: but they look like different color ones, A: like I have, uh, yellow ones, A: and I have red ones, A: and I have purple ones B: Uh-huh. A: and then they have like, you know, the real velvety looking stuff inside B: Oh, yeah. A: it looks just like orchids in different colors. A: That's what they look like. B: Oh, really pretty. A: They are, they're beautiful. A: Uh, I have a friend when I lived out in the country, A: and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year, you know, or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with. B: Uh-huh. A: And I mean they were real expensive. A: They were like, well, A: the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty-two fifty for one bulb. B: Oh, my gosh. A: So what she would do is she would plant them, and they multiplied. A: So the next year when she, you know, weeded them out so they wouldn't be as thick, then she'd give me some of the bulbs. B: Uh-huh. A: And, I mean, I have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen. A: So, when we decided to move, it was really funny because, like I said, I had a whole bunch of different kinds of things, A: and I kept saying, Well, I want to take a few of these, and I want to take these, and I want to take these. A: My husband finally said, Look, are we going to take the grass? A: Can we leave the grass? A: I said, Yes, we may leave that. B: take the whole grass, the whole yard. A: And we had a tree that was like seventeen foot tall, or something like that, that he said, No, no, I am not taking the tree. A: You know, I mean, every time we went outside, he'd look at something that was humongous, you know, A: No, A: we're not taking that. A: But the last day, he said, Can't we leave the grass, A: and I said, Yeah, A: I think we will leave that. B: That'd be funny. A: But, I brought, A: my kids, when they were little they had given me some azaleas so I brought all my azalea bushes. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: And you know, I brought, I brought as much as I could bring without, you know, really tearing up their place. B: Uh-huh. A: But, just like, um, you know, A: the people that bought ours, bought the place, but, um, I knew that they would, you know, A: if I left like one bulb of each one of them, by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them. B: Yeah. A: So, it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something, you know, A: it would cover it right up. B: Uh-huh. A: But, I just couldn't see it, you know, going off and leaving everything like that. B: Yeah. A: Because this house, I really liked it and everything, but the yard was a lot to be desired. A: Oh there was nothing. B: Oh. A: These people, A: we have one ugly pine tree. A: I mean, and it is ugly. A: I even tried making it look nicer, you know, A: I tied the yellow ribbon around it, A: and it was so ugly. A: Oh, it did not help, let me tell you. A: I took it off and put it on my door. A: I did not want to call attention. A: I mean, it was terrible. A: So really the plants that I brought over and put out here are just about all. A: I don't do any of the mowing or, you know, edging and all that B: Uh-huh. A: My husband does all that stuff. A: But that's because I'm allergic to the grass. B: Oh, that'd be awful. B: I love going out in the Summer in the grass. A: Really. B: Uh-huh. A: Now I like to go to the beach where the sand is, A: because then it doesn't make me ill B: Yeah. B: out on the outskirts A: so, B: Okay, B: because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit? A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: We are a little lucky. A: Well, my brother lives ten miles from here B: You're at, A: and he gets frost A: and, his crop gets killed. B: Yeah. B: You're right across the, uh, lake from, what, Plattsburgh? A: Yeah, A: from Plattsburgh Air Force Base. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: But, um, B: Yeah, B: I had, I had a cousin that was stationed there, Plattsburgh for a while. B: He, he remembers lots of snow A: Yeah, A: Plattsburgh's kind of a, A: it's, uh, it's, uh, depressed economically. B: Oh, really, oh. A: When you go across the lake, um, A: I don't know why we have so much going for us, A: I really don't. A: I'm, just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at Digital A: and they've never had, well, they've had layoffs recently, A: but when we got hired here, no, no, never any layoffs, never, never, A: and now we're looking at serious, A: I, I mean, I'm a technician. B: Yeah. A: When they start getting rid of technicians, B: Yeah, B: well, I'm, I'm working for T I, Texas Instruments, down here. A: Well, I interviewed with them. B: Oh, yeah? A: But I didn't want to go to Texas. B: Oh, A: Even though my, um, mother's people are from Georgia. B: Oh, A: Yeah. B: yeah. A: Well, I guess we have to get back to hobbies since, B: Yeah, B: we're getting to where, we're straying, I guess, A: Stick on the subject. B: yeah. A: Well, interesting thing that I do is with, gardening, uh, A: my sister grows flowers that you can dry, B: Uh-huh. A: and you can make uh, dried flower arrangements A: and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun. A: And we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with, uh, dried red flowers and dried white flowers and, uh, eucalyptus. B: Huh, yeah. A: you know what eucalyptus is? A: It's, B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: the, they uh, it's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries. A: Yeah, A: it's got a B: It's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it B: but, A: Yeah, A: at first I'm like, oh, how, why do people like this, A: but it, it is kind of a nice smell after a while. A: People put them in, B: Yeah, B: I didn't realize what it was for a while. B: I'd walk into a room where some of that, B: and I'd wonder what is that, you know, B: and then one day I, I realized that it was eucalyptus. A: it's, it's, it's, uh, like a fad thing. A: I, I don't know. A: It's, I've never heard of it, A: in the last five years I've used so much of it that, B: Yeah. A:
