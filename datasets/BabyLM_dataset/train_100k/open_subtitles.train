thesky ona naturalhigh - I don'tknowyou Lovingyoumore You got any cigarettes in here? You won't find any cigarettes in there. - Can we stop and get cigarettes? - Sure. Have you ever been to the River Bottom? - I don't think so. - It's all right. It's a cop bar. Can we just stop at a 7-Eleven or something? - I thought you might like to have a drink. - I'd love to, but not there. How 'bout the Hilton by the airport? - Is it dark? - Kind of a sports bar. It doesn't sound dark. Why does it have to be dark? Because it looks like I just got out of jail, that's why. You're dropping me off at my place. There's a joint near me. [Metallic Rattling] [Metal Ball Rattling] No, thanks. I quit three years ago. - Gain weight? - Ten pounds. - Take it off and put it back on. - [Scoffs] That's why I don't quit. Mm. If I can't fly, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my rent. You know, the other day I figured out that I must have written about... 15,000 bonds since I've been in the business. I figure about 80% oft hose were drug-related, so... if you want, I could help you figure out your options. So far, they told me if I cooperate, then I'll get probation, maybe. Or if I stand mute, I can get as much as five years. Does that sound right? I'd say that if they try you and convict you, you won't get more than a year and a day. That's state time, prison. But they won't want to do that. They'll offer you simple possession, a couple of months of county time... and a year or two of probation. Do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag? Yeah. But that's not what this is about. They were waiting for my ass. They knew about the money. - They even knew the exact amount. - What did they want to know? Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. They found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off. They said it was him who told them about me. That would be... Beaumont Livingston. How do you know about him? I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday. Ordell pick up his bond? Same as you--$10,000.

Come on in. - Do you got some booze? - I got some vodka in the freezer. - Got some O.J.? - Mm-hmm. Why don't you be a good hostess... and hook a brother up a screwdriver? Sure. Well? - You gonna thank me? - For what? Who the hell do you think got your ass out of jail? The same guy that put my ass in jail. Thanks a lot. Hey, you got caught with blow. That's your business. - It wasn't mine. - What? Oh, shit. [Chuckles] I bet that was that present Mr. Walker was sending Melanie. Yeah. If you didn't put it in there, he must have. Damn. That shit wasn't called for. Baby, I'm sorry. Bet they asked you a whole shit load of questions about it, huh? And all that money, where it came from. Probably asked you who you was bringing it to too. They asked. And you said? - "I want to talk to my lawyer." - [Laughs] You sure you didn't get nervous and kind of let something slip? I mean, if you did, I ain't mad at you. I just gotta know. You ain't asking the right questions. You should be asking why they picked me up. They were waiting for me. They knew about the money and they knew the exact amount. - [Lighter Clicks] - They tell you how they happen to come by this information? Hmm. [Exhales] Beaumont Livingston? I knew it. I knew it. They even asked me if I knew Mr. Walker. Yeah? I didn't tell them anything about him. My name come up? Mm-mm. - You ain't said nothing about me? - Mm-mm. Ah, that's mighty noble of you. They tell you what happened to this Beaumont fellow? Yeah, they told me. Yeah. Somebody must have been real mad at old Beaumont. Or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time. Yeah, I bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions. And you ain't giving them no kind of answer? - Mm-mm. - You scared of me? You got any reason to be nervous around me? [Gun Hammer Cocks] Is that what I think it is? What do you think it is? - I think it's a gun pressed up against my dick. - Well, you thought right. Now, take your hands from around my throat, nigger. -What the hell's wrong with you, Jackie? -Shut the fuck up. Don't you move. Oh, what is this? What the fuck is this? Hey, that ain't got nothing to do with you. I carry that all the time. You been talking to them police too much. - The police didn't try and strangle my ass. - Come on, girl. - I was just playing with you. - I ain't playing with you. I'm gonna unload both of these motherfuckers if you don't do what I tell you to do. - You understand what I'm saying? -Jackie, stop acting crazy. - Do you understand what the fuck I'm saying? - Yeah, woman. Damn! Now, sit your ass down on that sofa. See? Police start fucking with your mind, start pitting black against black. - That's how they do. They been doing this since-- - Shut your raggedy ass up. Sit the fuck down! - [Sighs] - And put your hands behind your head. - This is getting silly now. - Oh, silly? You want to see some motherfucking silly? If I have to tell you to shut up one more time, I'm gonna shut you up. - I just came over here to talk to you. - To talk? The way I see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about. One thing, and that's what you are wiling to do for me. - I can get you a lawyer. - No, let's be realistic. Now, sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. - That's why you came here to kill me. - I ain't come over to kill you. No, that's all right. It's okay. Now, I forgive you. Now, let's say, if I tell on you, I walk. - If I don't, I'll go to jail. - Uh-huh. I want $100,000... in an escrow account in my name... if I'm convicted up to a year or put on probation. Now, if I have to do more than a year, you pay another $100,000. I can do that. - You know I got that problem. All my money is-- - In Mexico. - Right. - Well, I been thinking about that too. I got me an idea. Uh-- Let me hear that. We friends again. Why don't you point that motherfucking gun somewhere else? - I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on. - All right. [Door Tapper Knocking] You want your gun back? Come in and I'll get it for you. [Children Shouting, Chattering] Max, look, I am so sorry about this. You know, I was afraid to ask to borrow it, 'cause I was afraid you would say no. I mean, you'd have to. Would you like some coffee? - If you're having some. - I am. Come on in. Why don't you make yourself at home? Just, you know, have a seat. Did you get a chance to use it? I felt a lot safer having it. Oh, the milk went bad while I was in jail. - Black's fine. - Cool. Would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while? It wouldn't be legal, but if it makes you feel better, I guess-- Well, thanks. I got one now. - You went out this morning and bought a gun? -[Water Running] - What? I didn't hear you. - You went out this morning and bought a gun? Well, let's say I got one now, okay? - Somebody loan it to you? - Yeah. [Water Pouring] All right! We're on. It might be a little black. Would you like to hear some music? Sure. Cool. You know, I couldn't wait to get home last night... and wash the jail outta my hair. - It looks nice. - Thanks. You never got into the whole CD revolution? Oh, I got a few, but I can't afford to start all over again. I mean, I've invested too much time and money... [Blows] in my albums. Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on records. I don't get new stuff that often. [Lighter Clicks] I gavemy heart and soul Toyou,girl Didn'tIdoit,baby - Didn'tIdoit,baby - It's pretty. Mm-hmm. - Who is this? - The Delfonics. - Didn'tIdoit,baby - It's nice. - Mm-hmm. - Didn'tIdoit,baby I called in sick today. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available. - Are you? - I don't know. I'm gonna go in and talk with Nicolet and Dargas today. I'm going to do what you suggested-- offer to help and see what happens. What I meant was to have a lawyer do the negotiating for you. No, I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money. Well, if it's the A.T.F. guy that wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point. I know, but it's a lot of money. It's a half a million dollars all in Cabo, and more coming in. - How'd you find that out? - Ordell told me last night. - He called? - He came by. - What'd you do? - We talked. Do you think he still trusts you? He had his doubts at first, but he's always trusted me. And he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can. - Why? - Because he needs my ass. Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit over there in Cabo. You want some sugar? No, thank you. There's gotta be other ways of getting it out. Maybe, but I'm the only one he's ever used. I mean, he can't use his other people. They're crooks. I mean, he might try to... bring the money in himself, but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines. So, either he recruits another Cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me. And I made him feel like he still can. Are you gonna offer to set him up? Yeah, if I get off. Otherwise, fuck them. It's very possible that Ordell's killed somebody. Do you realize that? Well, I ain't going back to jail and I ain't doing that probation thing again. Max, how do you feel about getting old? You're not old. You look great. [Chuckles] No, I'm asking you how do you feel about getting old. - Doesn't it bother you? - It's not really something I think about. - Really? - I guess I got sensitive about my hair a few years ago. It started falling out, so I did something about it. How'd you feel about that? I feel fine with it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it. I did it to feel better about myself, and, you know, I do. I look in the mirror. Looks like me. Yeah, but it's different for men. You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in this department. I bet that, except for possibly an afro, you look exactly the way you did at 29. Well, my ass ain't the same. Bigger? Yeah. Ain't nothing wrong with that. Something else worry you? Oh. [Sighs] I always feel like I'm starting over. - How many bonds you said you wrote? - 15,000. - Is that a lot? - That's plenty. Passthemby Well, I've flown over seven million miles, and I've been waiting on people for 20 years. Then after my bust, the best job I could get was with Cabo Air, which is the worst job you can get in this industry. You know I make 16,000 a year, plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn? And with this arrest hanging over my head, Max, I'm scared. And if I lose this job, I gotta start all over again, and I ain't got nothing to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. Oh,baby,pleasenow And that shit is more scary than Ordell. La,la ,la means I loveyou [Printer Buzzing] -[Woman] Let's go. - [Man] You don't have to- - Ow! - Hey! - Hey, great, you're here. - Yeah. Hey, Jackie. How're you doing? - Fine. - Can I have a word outside with Ray for a minute? - Sure. Take your time. - I'll just be a minute. - May I smoke? Absolutely. - Dude, what up? - She wants to make a deal. - Oh, yeah? Did she sound scared? - She almost sounds scared. - What's she want? - She wants to go back to work. - Oh, yeah? So what's she going to give us? - She hasn't gone into specifics. -She's been waiting for you to get here. -She knows it's my case, right? Well, she hasn't said it, but she's not stupid. - She knows it's you who wants her. - Let's go. Cool. [Dargas] Jackie, sorry to keep you waiting. [Nicolet] Now, what can we do for you? I need permission to leave the country so I can keep my job. - Yeah, we can look into that. - I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired. Well, you know what we want. If I'm working, I can help you. Help us do what, Jackie? - Help you get Ordell Robbie. - So now, you do know him. You never asked if I did or not. -So you're telling us now that you do know him. - Of course I do. - I deliver money for him. - No shit? - You know how he makes his money? - He sells guns. - You ever see him sell a gun? - No. - Then how do you know he sells guns? - He told me. Besides, why else would a A.T.F. man be after him? [Snickering] Well, how can you help us? I'll do anything I can to help you get his ass, short of wearing a wire. And in return for my help, I need permission to leave the country, and immunity. You don't want much, do you? Can you do it or not? You know, I mean-- It's possible. You're going to hear a guy beg for his life, lady, 'cause he betrayed Nani Vitali. Read the paper. - Read it! - [Crying] [Man On TV] Nani Vitali, a dangerous criminal. He's already killed two people. - You know what he's known as? The Mad Dog Murderer. - [Water Gurgling] [Ordell Clears Throat] - Hey, girl. - Hola! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Looks like somebody got some new clothes. Yeah, we did a little shopping. You know, I couldn't have my boy running around looking like no bum. -I don't know. I didn't look like a bum. -Come on now, man. - You know you had that Salvation Army thing going. - [Chuckling] Goddamn, girl. You getting high already? It's just 2:00. It's that late? You smoke too much of that shit, that shit's gonna rob you of your ambition. Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV. [Louis, Melanie Laughing] -[Phone Ringing] - Oh, y'all a couple of Cheech and Chongs, huh? - Oh, don't get up. I got it. - [Melanie Laughing] Have a seat. Yo. Jackie! What's up? No, Jackie, I didn't get your message. - I was gonna tell you! - No, no, no, no, no, not on the phone. -[Man On TV] Is she a good lay, huh? - Here. - You gotta make sure ain't nobody following you. - It's ready to go? Yeah. There's another bowl left. [Woman On TV Gasping] Let me go! [Lighter Clicks, Water Gurgling] - Take your thumb off the carb. - [Chokes] You mean, the sign that's got the rooster on it? [Coughing] Shit. [Melanie] You okay? I'm just... getting old. [Coughing] I can't... smoke or laugh now without coughing. Coughing's good. It opens up the capillaries. You know, when you cough, you're pulling air-- or in this case, smoke-- into parts of the lungs that don't normally get used. And so, coughing's good. It gets you higher. You definitely know a lot about that. Look here, Louis, I got to run out for a little while. So, since you like getting high so much, why don't you hang out here with Mel, watch a little TV? - Way ahead of you. - See, I get high later on when I come back. See, I get high at night when I get through with all my business. - [ ThemeMusicOn TV ] - That Rutger Hauer? No, it's Helmut Berger. Hmm. - Why don't you walk me to the door, space girl? - Okay. - You know, I hope you don't mind hanging out with Louis. - No problem. Try not to tear his clothes off of him, all right? They're new. - Ha, ha, ha! - Ha, ha! [Kisses] - Yo, Louis! Catch you later, man. - Okay. Later. - Want a Metrix? - [Coughs] Uh- - Damn. Shit. What's a Metrix? [Coughs] It's like this major meal that you drink in a shake instead of having a big meal. - It's like a diet thing? - No. It's what bodybuilders drink to, you know, beef up. No, thanks. [Coughing] Okay. When was the last time I saw you? Oh... six, seven years ago. It doesn't seem like that long ago. - It was that long ago. - [Men On TV Shouting] - How old were you in this picture? - Which one? The roller disco picture. This one. Oh. Um, 14. - You were 14 here? - Yup. Shit, man. I thought you were at least 16. Well, I'm about the same height now as I was then. [Man On TV] Bruno! Sanchez! [Water Running] [Blender Whirring] [Whirring Stops] - That other picture, that green one? - Yeah? That was taken at that place called Flippers. Do you remember that? It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. then? - No. - Where were you? I was in Detroit. With Ordell? Yeah. We had done some time already. Oh. Were you a... disco guy? Nah. - Come on. Don't lie. - No, I wasn't. I don't like to dance. - Were you ever in one? - I went to a few just to meet women, but... it was so loud and I didn't like to dance. During that whole scene, I just drank in bars usually. So who didn't make the cut? - That's a picture of me in Japan. - Whose arm is that? Uh, that's the guy that I lived with. His name was Hi-Hiro-- Hiro- - Hiroshi. - He must have made quite an impression. - [Laughs] If you count cheese. I never got to know him really. You know, I couldn't speak any Japanese, and his English was terrible. But what am I going to say? His English was better than my Japanese, you know. - That sounds like a problem. - Not really. You know, we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway. I never really got to know him, but I knew enough to know... that I wasn't missing much, so-- Anyway, I keep that picture because, of all the fucking time I was there, that's the only picture I've got of me in Japan. - That's Japan. - Oh. Yeah. Well- - Yeah, I can-- Yeah, it looks- - I could tell. Wanna fuck? Yeah. [Heavy Breathing] [Panting] That was fun. Yeah. Yeah, that really hit the spot. [Sighs] Now we can catch up. Yeah. [Coughs] [Panting] You got a beer? Yeah, sure. In the fridge. Uh,Imean,damn Me and you forever hand in hand I 'mmarriedto thefirm,boo You got to understand I 'lldieforthem,gimmeachair and then I'll fry for them - Andif Igot totake thestand I'm a lie for them - Lieforthem - It'sme andyou handinhand - Forever - I 'mmarriedto thefirm,boo You got to understand - Thatwe be I 'lldieforthem,gimmeachair and then I'll fry for them - Andif Igot totake thestand I'm a lie for them - Uhh,sugar [Alarm Chirps] [ SoundSystem: Woman Vocalizing] I'm going to the bar, baby. Twopeople -Jackie Jack! - Hey. Damn! I'm gonna have to remember this place. This is all right. About two minutes from your crib, ten minutes from the gig. Not bad. - What's your drink, brother? - Let me get a screwdriver, home. - How're you doing? - Oh, I'm fine. - Yes, you are. - [Jackie, Ordell Chuckle] Damn! I bet you come in here on a Saturday night, you need nigger repellant to keep them motherfuckers off your ass. - Oh, I do okay. - Bullshit, Jackie. You're a fine motherfucker. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. - You think anybody followed you? - I don't think so. But it don't matter,'cause they already know I'm meeting you. - How the fuck they know that? - I told them. - You told-- - 3.25. - Here. Keep it. - Thank you, sir. - You told them it's me? - They already know it's you. Goddamn, that don't mean you got to confirm it. Look, the only way they're going to give me permission to fly... is if I agree to help them, which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I might as well give them somebody they already know--you. You tell them anything else? Yeah, you got a half a mill in Mexico and you want me to bring it in. - Goddamn- - You told them all that? - It's true, ain't it? What the fuck that got to do with anything? They know I'm delivering for you. I told them about the half mil. They could give a fuck about it. All they wanna do is catch your ass with guns. So I said, "Look, you want proof he's getting paid for selling them? - Let me bring in the money." -And they said? - Yes. - [Grunts] Hey, what's the matter? I mean, that's what we discussed last night. This is just seeming kind of risky now, you know. Fuck this. Now, let me lay it all out to you, okay? I make two deliveries-- the first with 10,000. You know, like a dry run? They watch it, see how it works. Then the second delivery, I come home with the half mil. Mm-mm, mm-mm. See, that's too much exposure. - Now, I ain't going nowhere near that money. - You don't have to. I told them you never pick up the money yourself. - You always send someone, and I never know who it is. - Mm. - That's a good idea. - If you listen, it's a damn good idea. Now, the first time I do it, they're looking around, they see me hand the 10,000 to someone. - Who? - I don't know. A friend of yours. - Like a woman? - If you want. Yeah. Yeah, I'm thinking a woman. Wait a minute. If they're gonna let you go, - how come we don't bring all the cash in the first time? -'Cause I don't trust them. Now, the next trip, when I bring in the half mils, it's gonna look like I'm doing the same thing as I did before. - But you don't? - No. I hand it to someone else first. Hmm. And they follow the wrong one, thinking she's bringing the money to me. - That's the idea. - So, we gonna need two women. - Can you cover that? - Yeah. Yeah, I got the women covered. Where are you planning on puling this off? The Dell Amo Mal, the food court. And I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself? It's my plan. We're in this together. Yeah, but it's my money and I don't need no fucking partners. I ain't your partner. I'm your manager. And I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do it all under the nose of the cops. So, therefore, I'm your manager, and a manager gets 15%. - No, a manager gets ten percent. - No, that's an agent. - I'm gonna give you ten. - No. No. A manager gets 15%, agent gets 10. I'm getting 15%, all right? All I'm gonna give you is ten. And the same deal as before. I can do that. So he says, "Fuck that, " and moves over into guns. See, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit. He's acting like he's this big international arms dealer... when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers. Well, he seems to be making out. - Is it dead? - Yeah. Yeah, well... so far, he is. But you got to admit, he's not too bright. Oh... I wouldn't go so far as to say that. He moves his lips when he reads. What does that tell you? Let's say that he's streetwise, you know. We'll give him that. He's still a fuckup. [Water Gurgling] He killed a man who worked for him the other day. - Well-- - [Gurgling] So, what are you trying to tell me? That I should get out of here? That's not what I'm saying at all. You know where he went? He went to go meet that stewardess. - Does that bother you? - Please! Well, I don't know. You live with him, so-- No, I live here. He just drops in and out. Did he tell you about that half million he's got down in Mexico? - Uh-huh. - Of course he did. He tells anybody who's gonna listen. Well, that's what him and that stewardess are doing. They're scheming on how they can get that money over here. And your point is? - Let him and the stewardess get the money over here, - Uh-huh. and then just take it from them. [Man] A manwe passed just tried to stare me down - Can I ask you a question? - [Ordell] Oh, man. - You ain't gonna get serious while we're in here chilling? - No. It's just about Melanie. You know what? I'm really sorry about that, man, but I had to be somewhere all of a sudden. I figured, well, shit, Louis ain't had no pussy for a while. So I thought, let him kick it here with Mel. [Mutters, Chuckles] Thethingsthatyoudo So, what she say? She didn't have to say shit. I know Melanie. That bitch is gonna be fucking you two minutes after I'm out the door. Melanie really good about throwing a fuck a nigger's way. I mean, she ain't no damn good at it, but she likes to fuck. - Oh, so she ain't your girlfriend? - Is that what you thought? - No, I wasn't sure. I didn't know. - But you fucked her anyway? Well... the "not your girlfriend" part I felt more about. Oh. Well, I hope you felt appropriately guilty afterwards. Afterwards, I did. Oh, oh, shit. [Clears Throat] But, um- - But, like, you know, what is she to you? You know, she's just one of the bitches I got set up. I got Mel over in Hermosa Beach, and I rent this little place for Simone over in Compton where you're staying, and about four blocks away I got this young 19 year old country girl named Sheronda. I found her on the bus stop two days out of Georgia, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my place in Compton, told her it was Hollywood. - [Laughing] She believed you? - Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Closest she ever been, anyway. But you trust Melanie around your business? Oh! [Chuckles] She trying to play your ass against me, ain't she? - Yeah. - Uh-huh. See, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it! See, you didn't have to say nothing. I know that bitch. I don't understand why you keep someone around your business and you can't even trust them. I ain't gotta trust her. I know her. I don't know what that means, man. Well, you can't trust Melanie, but you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie. Well, I don't understand why you keep her the fuck around. I told you, man. She's my fine little surfer girl. You know, she ain't pretty as she used to be... and she bitch a whole lot more than she used to, but she white. [Latch Clicking, Keys Jangling] [Answering Machine Beeps] [Electronic Voice] You have one message sent at 8:06 p.m. - [Machine Beeps] - Hi, Jackie. It's Max. I was just calling to find out how everything went today at A. T.F. If you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302. Or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688. It's on the card I gave you when we first met. I don't know whether you still have it, but it's on it. Oh, let me give you my beeper number. - It's 991-1075, - [Drink Pouring] then dial 6872. Wait for a beep, dial 59... and hit the pound. Um, okay, so I'll talk to you later. - Hope everything's well. Bye-bye. - [Beeps] [Electronic Voice] End of message. [People Chattering] Now, the money's gonna be in a Dell Amo shopping bag, all right? I get some food, sit down here in the food court, then your girl comes in. - Did you find somebody yet? - Mm-hmm. - Who? - What you care? What I care is my ass facing the penitentiary. - You send some hardheaded rock whore up here and she-- - Hey, hey, hey, hey! She ain't gonna be no rock whore. She's gonna be cool, promise. [ MovieThemeMusic: Rock Instrumental] - All right, so we straight, right? - Mm-hmm. I'm gonna roll up over here and check out this shirt I was looking at. - I'll catch you. - Hey, don't forget your bags. [Exhales] Shit! Max! Max! Hey. Well, hello. - Hey, surprise. - I walked right past you. I know, ignoring me. So, what are you up to? -Just catching a movie. - What'd you see? What the fuck is up with this shit? - I called you last night. - I know. I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner with me so we can, you know, talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it, a sting. He's been-- He's been really nice. You think he's got a thing for you? Maybe. But I'm thinking it's something more like he wants the money for himself. Has he hinted around? No. He just tries to act cool. You know, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. He's just a young guy having fun being a cop. I know the type. Trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than he is in the money. If he does anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction, but he wouldn't walk off with the money:, it's evidence. - And what about you, Max? - What? If I was in Nicolet's place? No, I mean you right now, not if you were somebody else. If I saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it? You know where it came from. It's not like it's somebody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed. Half a million dollars will always be missed. You're avoiding the question, Max. Okay, sure, I guess I'd be tempted, especially now since I'm getting out of the bail bond business. - Why? - A lot of reasons. I guess the main one would be, uh... I'm tired of it. When did you decide? It's been a long time coming, but I finally made up my mind. I guess it was... Thursday. - [Gate Buzzes] - Miss Brown? - Yes? - I'm Max Cherry, your bail bondsman. The night you got me out of jail? Yeah. I went to pick up this guy. I hear he's staying at a house, and, uh... I sneak in and I'm waiting for him-- Wait a minute. After we were together, you snuck into a guy's house? Yeah. I went back to my office and found out that you took my gun, got another gun and the stun gun, went to this guy's house in Ell Monte and waited for him to come home. - What do you do when he comes home? - Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, you cuff him and take him to County. - You do that? - It's my job. - Did you do that that night? - Well, the guy never came home. But I'm sitting on his couch in the dark holding my stun gun. The whole house smells of cat pee. And after a couple of hours, I think, "What am I doing this? It's 19 years of this shit." And I make up my mind. That's it. I'm not sure you answered my question, Max. Which one? If you had the chance, unemployed now, to walk away with a half million dollars, would you take it? [Airplane Engine Humming] We gotta stop meeting like this. - How was your flight? - Fine. - Bet you're happy to be working again. - Yeah. This is A.T.F. Agent Ray Nicolet. Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie. Money exchange, trial run. Time is 3:07, July 1, 1995. Location is a parking structure at LAX, row "F'.' parking structure "D." - What are you doing? - Recording all this. - I thought you were going to let this one go through. - We are. Don't worry about it. Every bit of this goes in my report. The subject is carrying a flight bag. I am now removing from the flight bag a manila envelope. - [Clears Throat] - The envelope contains currency. - All the same denomination? - Mm-hmm. One-hundred-dollar bills. Okay, I'm now counting it. - What time do you have to be there? - 4:30. I'm meeting a woman. - What's her name? - He wouldn't say. -You gonna follow her? -When she leaves, somebody'll be on her. - You're not gonna stop her? - No, not this time. Okay. The total amount of cash... in the manila envelope is $10,000, right? - The subject is delivering the currency in a-- - Oh. - [Clears Throat] - Dell Amo Fashion Center bag. Dell Amo Fashion Center bag. - The bag is, uh... purple-- - It's white. - Huh? White. - It's white. - Fine, the bag's white-- - With pink lettering. - Purp-- - Image is purple. - Lettering's pink. - Fine-- Okay, the bag's white. It's got purple on it, and the lettering's pink. - Right. - And a really good-looking woman on the cover. Okay. There you go. - [ MuzakPlaying] - [People Chattering] - This seat taken? - No. Have a seat. - You're hungry. - Yes'm. Put the bag on the floor, okay? Under the table, next to mine. And then when I leave-- Well, you know. So, what's your name? Sheronda. Sheronda, that's a nice name. Sheronda, go ahead. You can eat. Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you. All right. I'll be back. I'll check the bag. Stay here. Max, you said it yourself. Ray wants Ordell. He doesn't give a shit about the money. The money won't convict him. Guns will. You're rationalizing. Well, that's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do it, Max. I know I can. I just can't do it without you. It's cool. Excuse me, baby. Uh, do you know what time it is? - No, ma'am. I ain't got no watch. - Oh. Hmm. It could work. If she handles the cops right, it could work. I gavemy heart and soul Toyou,girl Didn'tIdoit,baby Didn'tIdoit,baby -[Phone Rings] - [Woman] What? -Jackie Brown. - [Buzzes] [Ordell] It ain't like I'm asking you to go somewhere and spend the night. I just want you to go out for a little while while I work this deal. So now you're going to pout! Now it's going to take her 20 minutes to find her purse, look for her sandals, find her sunglasses, get outta here. Jackie, Louis. Louis, Jackie. That chick you saw stomping around the back there, that's Melanie who about to leave! Have a good time in there, baby. Don't burn now. - Want a drink? - No. I want to talk to you now, outside. Now. Mm. Let's step into my office. Ooh, ooh, ooh. [Man On TV] The day I follow Audrey Hill Clayton-- - What's up? -...that day, I cut my throat. You got that we do it the way I laid out, or we don't do it at all! - What the hell you talking about? - What the hell I'm talking about? - Sheronda passed the money on to somebody else. - How do you know she did that? - I was there! I saw it! - You weren't supposed to be there. - I knew you would try to pull some shit like that! - Hold on! - I ain't puling no shit! - What do you call it, then? It's my goddamn money! I can do what the fuck I wanna do with it. With my ass on the line, oh, no, you fucking don't! -If we don't do it my way, then fuck it! -Jackie, Jackie, Jackie! - Now chill! Chill! - Oh, no! Chill, my ass! No! Listen! Listen! The woman you saw was my friend Simone. She's the one gonna be receiving the money. I think she oughta see how the shit go down. She's a nice woman. You'll like her. Matter of fact, she's on her way over here right now. Hold on. Louis, call Simone. Tell her to get her ass over here. We waiting on her. - Damn! That what you're pissed off about? - Oh, just a little pissed? - Mm, mm, mm. I'm sorry. -[Louis Chattering] I'm about ready for a refill. Are you sure I can't tempt you a little bit more? - Come on. - Okay, fine. Yeah. You better give me something strong. Now, Nicolet and Dargas are gonna stop me at the airport and mark your bills. I don't like that part. It washes off! I tell them we do the same thing as before, and they'll follow Sheronda. [Line Ringing] Yo, Louis. Louis? She ain't there? - Yo! No answer? - Hmm? Now, you gotta listen to this, man, 'cause this concerns you, all right? [Line Ringing] - Lou! - Hmm? Okay, now, this time you're going to get Sheronda a Billingsley bag, right? Right. The same one Simone gives me, okay? Now, Simone and I make the switch in Bilingsley. She knows what I look like? She's seen you with Sheronda, remember? All right. Now, Simone's gonna meet you in the dress department, right? - Right. Designer clothes. - Right, right, right, right. The place y'all try shit on. It's a fitting room. Big sign over the door. You can't miss it. Uh-- [Clears Throat] Why over there? Because they're gonna be watching my ass hard. That's why we can't take the risk in doing it out in the open... or even in the dining area. That's why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman. Okay. Now, you're going to take... the Bilingsley bag Simone gives you and give it to Sheronda. - Right. - And Simone going to wait. Then she's going to peep out the dressing room, wait on you... to give her the sign there ain't nobody watching. She's going to leave the store, get in the car, mission accomplished. Hey! See? So, what are you going to be doing during all this? Now that you got them watching my ass, I'm gonna be in a titty bar waiting on Louis... to call me and tell me everything's cool. [Pager Beeping] I got to go! Hey! [Pager Beeping] - Damn! Who's wanting to page you like that? - It's Ray, the A.T.F. guy. That shit work my nerves, you and that motherfucker being so buddy-buddy. Hey, if I wasn't so buddy-buddy with that motherfucker, this wouldn't work. Ordell has a guy working for him named Louis. - You two meet? - Yeah, this afternoon before I came here. He was at Ordell's apartment in Hermosa Beach. Yeah. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out. - Did you talk to him? - Not really. Mm-mm. His full name's Louis Gara. Just did four years up in Susanville. - For what? - Bank robbery. We've been following him. He definitely works for Ordell. They did two years together about, I don't know, 20 years ago or so over at Huntsville. He's not living over in Hermosa Beach, though. Ordell's got him staying down in Compton. Living with some 56 year old petty thief, some woman named, uh... Hawkins, Simone Hawkins. Hmm. - You know her? - No. - They ever talk about her? - Not yet. Okay, who's the other one? Some white chick named Melanie, another girlfriend of Ordell's. - What's her deal? - It was her coke I got busted with. - Oh, yeah? - She knows everything. She's not a part of it, and she's pissed off that she's not a part of it. Well, this is definitely somebody I wanna meet. Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow? Everything okay? Everything's the same, except for one change. - I told him Ordell's changing the amount he's bringing in. - Think they bought it? Mm, oh, yeah. I got them thinking that Ordell's real nervous, and they love thinking that he's scared of them. You know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit. All he needed was a reasonable explanation. Everything's the same, except for one change. What's that? Ordell feels way too hot for him to bring in his money, and he knows you're watching him and he's fucking paranoid. - So he's sweating a little bit. - He's gonna keep his half mil where it is, but he's gonna bring in 50,000 just in case he needs bail. - It'll be more than that. - Don't be so literal. Ray believed it. You still have to show him the money at the airport. I'm not gonna show him the whole amount. He'll see 50,000. - And where's the rest of it? - In the bag, underneath. - What if he checks? - He won't. He didn't before. He's expecting to see 50,000, and there it is, on top. - You're taking a hell of a chance, kid. - Not really. If he finds it, I'll say Mr. Walker put it in there... and I didn't know anything about it, like the coke. -Well, then you're out. You get nothing. -Yeah, but I'm not in jail... and at least I tried. You're going to have surveillance all over you. That's why you don't make a move until I come out of that fitting room. - Wearing a dress. - Well, a suit. There's this one I had my eye on. - You know, it's like-- -[Phone Ringing] Excuse me. Hello? Look here, we got a little change in plans. No, no, no, no, it ain't no thing. Everything's the same, except one little difference. You know that bitch Simone you saw in the mall? Well, she wasn't here today 'cause she done split on my ass. Yeah. Me and Louis went by her pad. She gone. She gone, her shit's gone and my 10,000 motherfucking dollars is gone. Hey, hey, hey! Don't start bugging on me. Goddamn it, I'm telling you, ain't nothing different. Everything's just like we discussed. Now, except for this time when we make the split, instead of Simone it's gonna be Melanie. I think someone's knocking on the door. Goddamn it, Melanie got just as much sense as that bitch has, she'd be in the same place. All right. Yeah, later. [Man On TV Laughing] Yeah? Well, I'm gonna open it. - I hope he's a good sailor. - [Engine Revving, Siren Wailing] [Car Crashing] [Whispers] Chicken shit. [Water Bubbling] [Nicolet] Okay, the envelope contains $50,000. I've counted it, and I'm now marking the bills... in the upper left-hand corner in the second zero with a green felt-tip pen. [Bills Rustling] Ever been tempted? What? Put one of these in my pocket? Mm-hmm. If I did, I'd have to give one to you, wouldn't I? Of course, nobody knows how much there is. I guess we could take as much as we want. Isn't that right? Yes. All those things are true. I mean, it's not like the money belongs to anybody. - That would be one point of view. - Yeah. Except it's not a point of view shared by the A.T.F. Once we make this evidence, it belongs to us. - [Bills Rustle] - You're officially out of trouble now. Don't go doing something stupid. How can I do anything stupid when I'm being watched every second? You know, I'm glad you pointed that out, 'cause it saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you. Now, look. Here's the deal. I want you to take all this cash. I want you to put it in this Bilingsley shopping bag. And that is exactly what I expect to see... when I look inside Sheronda's Bilingsley shopping bag. Comprende? -Si, comprende. - Cool. [Man] Hey, there's only three reasons you couldn't make your court appearance. One, you in a hospital; two, you in jail; three, you ass is dead. - That means you're not my friend, man. Why're you putting-- - Winston! - Wait. Hold on a second. Wait a minute. - I'm gonna be gone a few hours. - Where you going? - Dell Amo Mal. Catch a movie, maybe something to eat. - What you gonna see? - Something that starts soon and looks good. Cool. Have fun. - Let's go! - [Melanie] In a minute! You said that before. Let's go! - Foundoutshe couldn'tfly -[Phone Ringing] Itwastoo late Andif it 'stoolate and she's gone too far - Hello? - Louis? What the fuck you still doing there, man? Well, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm waiting on her. I'm ready to go, yeah. You're the one in motherfucking charge! She keeps saying, "In a minute," right?

Jesus, what's wrong with you? - I'm carrying the bag. - All right, you got it. Take a chill pill, for chrissake. Fuck you and your chill pill. 'Member where we came in? No, that's towards Sears. Where the f-- Which way? Which way? Jesus, but if you two aren't the biggest pair of fuck ups... I've ever met in my entire life. How did you ever rob a bank? Hey, when you robbed banks, did you have to look for your car then too? No wonder you went to jail. Is it this aisle, Louis? Is it? [Chuckles] Louis? Lou-isss? Is it this aisle, or is it the next one over? - It's this one. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - You positive? You don't seem sure to me. Hey, don't say-- Don't say anything else, okay? Keep your mouth shut. - Well-- - I mean it. Don't say one fucking word, okay? - Okay, Louis. - [Gunshot] [Gunshot] See, just where I said it was. [Chuckles] God.

I understand. - How much is it? - [Saleswoman] Okay, blouse, pants. - And away we go. Comes to $267. - Here you go. - Wait! Your change! By the way, someone left a bag of beach towels in the last dressing room. Excuse me. My wife thinks she left a bag of beach towels in the fitting room. Yeah, I think they're there. Go get them. There's nobody in there. - Thanks. - Last stall. Got it. I wasn't even gonna buy anything. [Chuckling] -[Engine Starts] - ...doit ,baby I triedso manytimes and that's no lie Itseemstomake youlaugh each time I cry [Engine Idling] [Ordell] All right. Just keep driving to Ninth, where all them car dealerships is. We gonna leave this heap in the parking lot and pick up... a car the cops don't know nothing about. Where's Melanie? Well, that's what I wanna tell you. You see, she was bugging me the whole time. She got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. And then she started running her fucking mouth about, you know, like-- 'cause I couldn't remember where the car was parked right away when we came out. So then she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle, Louis? Is it that aisle, Louis?" It was totally fucking with my nerves, man. - So, what? You left her there? - I-I shot her. You shot Melanie? - Twice. In the parking lot. - You couldn't talk to her? - Well, how can you talk to her? You know how she is. - You couldn't just hit her? Maybe, but at that time-- moment, I don't know, I-- You shot her? Twice? - Is she dead? - I-I- - Pretty much. What do you mean "pretty much," Louis? That ain't no fucking answer. - Yes or no. Is she dead? - I-I think so. - You think so? Tell me Louis. Is she-- - She's dead. She's dead. - Well, where'd you shoot her? - In the chest and the stomach. If you had to do it, then you had to do it, brother. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman. Louis? What? Where's the rest of it? - How much is there? - I don't know. Maybe 40. Shit, maybe less. Well, you-- you said 550. Yeah, so you light, ain't you? You light about half a million, ten. Look, look, man. That's the bag she came out with. - She never put her hand in it. Neither did I. - Came out of where? The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to. - How long was she in there? - A minute. Not even a minute. She came right out. - Louis, you telling me the truth? - Listen, I swear to God, man. I swear on my life. She came out with that fucking bag, and I took it from her. -And then what? - And that was it. We went to the parking lot. - Where you shot her? - That's right. Louis, you sure Melanie ain't in a room somewhere with a half million dollars... I worked my ass off to get waiting for you? - Oh, fuck you for asking me that. - Hey, I know the bitch tried to set me up. - Fuck you, brother. How could you fucking ask me that? - She didn't ask you? Shit! Pull the car over a minute. Why'd you ask me that? -[Engine Cuts Out] - All right, so where's the gun you shot her with? It's in there. Now, what the fuck's that gonna tell you? I could've taken two out already. [Groans] [Sighs] [ MexicanFolkMusic Playing, Faint] It's Jackie Brown. Well, you know, if she got to it, why didn't she take it all? Oh, I'll be sure and ask that bitch before I blow her brains out. Well, maybe the Feds got it. Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. See, if there wasn't nothing in that bag but them towels, then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money... out of her suitcase and the A.T.F. got it. But she put them books in there to trick our ass. Well, that's why I didn't check it. Because the bag felt right. That's right. And then she puts 40 grand or so in there to rub that shit in my face. You know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off. Ah. I don- - I don- - You know, I don't know. I don't know. Unless, you know, either she's got it or the Feds got it. Or- - Or-- Now, check this out. What if she gave the money to somebody else first... before Melanie even went in the dressing room. Uh-huh. - Oh, man. You know what? - What? - Do you know who I saw in the dress department? - No, tell me. I didn't think anything of it. I- - No, no, I did wonder what he was doing there. I wondered what he was doing there, but I thought it had nothing to do with us. Like, maybe he was with his wife or his girlfriend. It's a big place-- Louis, Louis, Louis! You gonna tell me who you saw? - Yeah, Max Cherry. - Max Che-- You seen Max Cherry in the dress department where we-- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! You see that motherfucker in the dress department when we about to get a half million dollars. - And you don't think nothing about him being there? - No. Do they know each other? Hell, yeah, a mad girl like this? - There is something called humanity. - No problem. - You are 20 people. You must be tired so go and sleep. - Yes. Whatever had to happen has happened. - Now there is peace. - Okay. - Go and sleep now. - Okay, good night. Okay, I will come in your room. Oh god, she looks so beautiful. Amazing. What is this? You all haven't left till now. We will go. We will go after having tea. - Yes, we will go. - Bhaag Singh. I am getting late. Where has father trapped me? What is it? What are you looking at? - Am I looking mad? - No, no. You are not at all mad. Oh God. Hey, listen where are you taking our things? Uncle, where has he taken our things? - Calm down, calm down. - One minute. - Where has she gone? - Nothing has happened. He has got fit of being a washer woman. She will go to the shore and wash your things and bring it back. You will get your things cleaned for free. Idiot, you survive on her money and say lies about her. Shameless, why have you come her between men? - Go inside. - Keep quiet, otherwise I will hit you. - Boy. - Yes. The thing is that she is the owner of this entire property. Oh my God. He lied to you so that you do not beat him. Why shouldn't we? Uncle, you.. But where has she taken our things? Hey, what are you doing? Why? Mad people behave this way. They pick up the things and throw it like this. Isn't it? One more is left. Sister, I don't have underwear left. We request you... Anyway, we have come to apologize. Okay, we will catch our ears and even ready to do pushups. Come on do it. What are you doing? We made a mistake. For give us. If you come further then I will hit you. Understood. Get away. Why do you want to prove Bhaag Singh right? Look, please calm down. We will vacate your bungalow and leave. But please give this. - Immediately. - Yes immediately. - At this moment. - Yes, but let me first take my bag. - Hey, leave it. - My bag. Give me the bag. Leave the bag. Being a girl aren't you ashamed of doing this. Do you sing devotional songs? - this is too much. - Give me the bag. I will make sure I take the bag. There is nothing that belongs to your father. Give me the bag. You never know it might contain things that belong to my father. - I made a mistake. - Give it to me. Give it to me. What are you doing? - Let me see how you don't give this. What are you doing? - Give me the bag. - What kind of a girl are you? - What are you doing? - Give me the bag. - Give me the bag. - Give me the bag. - Don't touch the bag. - What are you doing? Leave me. Oh God. Hey, you are too much. - Give me the bag. - No, I will not leave it. Hey. "The shy eyes and sharp eyesight secretly said this." "Dear, you are crazy about me and love me."

"Dear, you are crazy about me and love me." "But shy." "But shy." "That my eyes just keep dreaming." "Very dreamy." "Very dreamy." "Dear, you are crazy about me and love me." There is still two hours left for your flight. You will easily reach the airport. This small visit to Dalhousie has brought such a big turn in my life. I had never thought that the person whom I did not know two days ago And now promised to spend my entire life with him. I am scared thinking that.. ..if Bhaag Singh was not a drunkard or gambler then I would be in loss. Wait for two more days. We will go together, Apoorva. No, no. - I had told you about ballet competition. - Yes. I have rehearsals for that.. ..and if I don't reach on time then its director won't spare me. But he is in your college so woo him or make any excuse. No, he is not my class mate. He passed college ten years ago. Just out of his interest he does direction and writes plays. Because of him our college has won three trophies, understood. Really. Then I will have to meet that man. Where are your classes going on? 'How shall I tell you that what you are for me?

'This brightness and playfulness you got from wind.' 'And beautiful hair you got from clouds.' 'Flowers bloom on lips and eyes are like streams.' 'There is moonlight hidden in your face and music in your voice.' 'Your body is like glass and complexion is like flowers.' 'You walk like rivers flow.' 'What beauty, what condition.' 'The colorfulness of your body is just like thousand butterflies.' 'The roundness of your arms and the shadows of your veil.' 'These rivers are of dreams.'

Since long we were watching you secretly. And you did not come to know. You are unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. It was magic. It was not acting. Till today I have never seen anyone lost in his character. Just with your face and words you made that girl alive in front of us. Who was not present here. Malhaar, I will act in that drama as that girl. Promise. - Alright. - Shall I also play a role in it? You work as a pole. Come on go, go and memorize your lines. Prakash, go at the light. Anna, I have brought that builder. With great difficulty I have been able to get Mr. Mansukhani. Come on. He is standing outside. Today, Apoorva will conduct everything. Water. It is time for water so I will have to go. - I will go and change my clothes. - Malhaar, Malhaar. You are truly unbelievable. I just adore you. Really. Hey! Yes. Boys, boys today I am Malhaar. Okay. 'How shall I tell you what are you for me? ' Come on. Where is Rahul? What a foolish person he was whom you made me meet? Even my commission of 2% has gone, sir. Anna, who were these people? These foolish people.. ..want to make shopping center of this theatre. They have bought seas.. ..rivers, mountains, farms and they want to make shopping centers of it. Their hunger is never satisfied. Son, I see my memories in your face. Never do cheating with theatre. Hey, where did you go so early in the morning? I had gone out. I very well know why you go so early in the morning. So that you don't have to listen to what I say. And you come back after I go to the office. You have food and then again you go in the evening. What can I do if tap water comes after you leave? Till I am alive you are getting water. If I die then you will not get even that. You don't worry about that. What should I do then? What should I do? Nowadays it is better to be uneducated rather than being 3rd class BA pass. At least he can lift up the burden. Who will give job to the 3rd class BA pass? Sarla died while giving birth to you. I have not touched any woman for last 30 years. And I kept on doing typing for four hours. My entire life has passed with this sound. People who have sons of your age lead a retired and peaceful life. Will you drink tea? And I am trying to get an extension for one year after retirement. For last three months I am running after my boss like a dog. - What is it? - Match box. Useless. What not have I done for you? Yes, you have done a lot. When did I say that you haven't? You locked me for 8 hours and went for work so that I could study more. I started hating books. Even then because of your fear I kept on trying. And kept on standing first. Once I did not stand first and you hit me with the broom. What was my age at that time? 10 or 11. But what have you thought now? What are you going to do with your life? From last 8 years when I finished studies.. ..you have been asking me this bitter question. And I have been giving you this sweet answer that I will only do drama. Yes, you will do make- up and do drama. Are you watching? I had thought that he would do what I could not. He will become a doctor, army officer or collector. It is not necessary that everyone.. ..should get degree or diploma or become an engineer. Nobody asks Zakir Hussain or Tendulkar what their degree is. - Really? - Yes. Which foolish person told you that you will become like them? Not someone. But life told someone in his ears that.. ..you will play cricket so he became cricketer. Someone said that go you will play the Tabla so he became Zakir Hussain. Similarly life told me in my ears that Malhaar you will become an actor. You will not be able to do anything except drama. Not only has yours, but the thinking of entire society has become rotten. As if academic success is the only success in life. I don't wish to hear your nonsense further so that is why I am going out. I have requested Mr. Chavlani of Raj transport. So with your 3rd class certificates reach their office.. ..at 10:30 in the morning. It will be good for rejection. - Sawant. - Sir. Tell Raj Singhania that if he does not shut down his shops on time.. ..then I will get the license of all his shops cancelled. Sir, but he is local MLA of this area. So what if he is the local MLA. I am the collector of this area. And tell him that law is equal for all. You go and I am also coming. - Where is my coat? - I am bringing. - Good, morning, dad. - Hi. Where are my spectacles? - Greetings, father. - How was the trip? - Superb, like always. - Great. Congratulations. Madam, for how many people should I cook food? - Listen.. - Classical singer Bahmani is coming at night. She is performing in the lawn. Listen, prepare food for about 25- 30 people at night. - First shot, bull's eye. - Very good. - Driver, after dropping sir to the office bring the car back. - Yes. - I want to go shopping. - Yes. - Find it that side. - Yes, but.. What are you finding mother? - I cannot find my spectacles. - Hey, father has worn it. You always do this. Okay, listen please put the thread in the needle. - This is matter of a second. - I am leaving, mother. - 2 seconds. - Nihaal. - Yes. - A call had come for you. - Whose call was it? - Some Apporva Chaudhary. She was asking when will you return. Here goes the thread. Yes. Okay, tell me which my middle finger is. - This one. - Not correct. Hey, not fair. Okay, tell me once more. Try it. - This one. - Again you touched the same finger. - What are you doing? - That's cheating. - What cheating? - You are cheating, okay. Okay fine. Hey, don't look. Now tell me. I will not hold your finger but your hand. Come on. I have talked with my father. - And he has invited your parents. - When? - Once my competition is over. - When is your competition? How shall I tell you what are you for me? How shall I tell you what are you for me? Aashish, Vincent. Goddess, you are free from curse. God has come to take you. Turn and look at your lover. He is broken because of fear of losing you. If you leave him and go then he will die. He cannot see your condition. Look.. shit. Stage lights. Your eyes should be wet. I want tears. Don't you understand? How many times have I explained? How many times have I explained that you are not Apoorva. You are a cunning woman. One is roaming on earth to get liberation. She will get liberation when someone loves her. When he expresses his love. That poet has expressed. He has expressed. He said that how shall I tell you that who are you for me. You got liberation and your beauty back. You have to go back to heaven from earth. God has come to take you. But you do not want to go. Because you have started loving this person. The person who does not love your body but your inner beauty. He loves your soul and not your body. They cannot pass time at home and come here to do drama. I want to take the obsession of love to that level.. ..where it appeases where this drama ends. At the end of this play all the viewers should be bound to their seats. An end that no one has seen. People will throw shoes at you the way you are doing. Do practice. Can't you cry? I will not be able to do it. - Why can't you cry? - I don't know how to cry? - What can I do? - What is so difficult in it? What can I do? I cannot cry. Why? What is so difficult in it? Do you know how to laugh? What is crying? Look. I do not want any dialogue. Count from 1 to 10 but from heart. You will automatically start crying. 1, 2, 3.. 4, 5, 6.. 7, 8.. 9, 10. Look, there are tears in my eyes. And look you have also started crying. Why are you crying? Because of fear. You can do it. Good girl. Come on. 1. 2, 3. "What should I do?" "What should I do?" "What should I do?" "What should I do?" "I am madly in love but I am not aware of it." "How can I solve the matters that are so complicated?" "What should I do?" "What should I do?" "Forget that you are an angel." "And you have come to know that you are someone else." "Even if you live for many years." "But the time spend with your beloved is much more than many ages." "By breaking all relations and leaving all compounds.." "..my heart wants to spend every moment with you. "What should I do?" "What should I do?" Come on Mohini, let's go in our dream boat. Let's go to our glittering village. The view of the rainbow and the stream that flows behind it. There is no one else in this journey. This journey is only yours and mine. Now what are you waiting for? When love is calling you and the dream world is in front. Come on Mohini, let's go in our dream boat. Let's go to our glittering village.

And the best actress award goes to Miss Apoorva Chaudhary. Congratulations. I am sorry sir but I cannot accept this award. Why? Someone else has the real right on this.

You all are lucky that you haven't got such a child. He is looking up. Looking up, what are you looking up? Is your father sitting up? Where are you running? Idiot. Your director hasn't come. Where has he gone? He is very shy in nature. He is just like a king on the stage. Out of the stage just like a stale flower. You seem to be quite impressed by him. Of course. I am sure you will good friends when you meet him. Why, why? Because you both are very good human beings. You know something. I am getting jealous of this guy. Really. But why hasn't he come yet? Did you find my area to commit suicide? Rascal, he wants to commit suicide. Sit up. Hey, come on sit up. Come on. Okay now tell me why were you committing suicide? I wasn't committing suicide. Then who was doing it? Your father? Their.. The sun at the horizon was committing suicide. I had thought that what will happen of my future. To save that I ran inside. People at the shore started shouting. Save, save. Who all are there in your house? - We are six of us. - Who all? Four walls, ceiling and I.. Rascal, he seems to be mad. - Hey, 342. - Yes sir. - Make him drink tea and let him go. - Okay sir. How did you think of committing suicide? For you I left my name and my every relation. And you did not think of me. That what will I do or where will I go without you. Malhaar, when life whispered in your ears that.. ..you will become an artist then you became happy. You had fought with the world. And today life is screaming in your ears that.. Malhaar that these tears, insult.. ..disrespect and bad words are not a curse. This is not weakness. With this curse your characters will get an identity. And when these characters will shine in the darkness of the stage Then the entire theatre will speak in one voice and one time that.. ..Malhaar, you are great. You have done a great job, Malhaar. Great.. My voice will be one of them. And you fool. You were going to throw this talent in the sea. Malhaar, because of your love.. ..I can be your any weakness.

Hang him to death, sir. Hang him to death, sir. Don't spare him. Don't spare him. Look. Look at this statue. Someone's love has trapped him in four breaths. I am repaying the value of those four breaths till today. No, Brahma, no I am not right for this love and faith. I am worth insult, expectation, and disrespect. Hey Vishnu, you are not responsible to take care of me now. Hey, Shiv Shankar, now I am the God of death. Now I will bring on destruction. And will become the reason for great destruction. I am the master of darkness. I am a clean soul. I am, Ashwathama. This court announces a punishment of 7 years.. ..for Malhaar Gopal Agnihotri for killing collector Abhijit Joshi. Sawant, what happened to the car? Sir, it has gone to the airport to get new collector sir. - Not even for a day.. - Yes.. Go and get auto for mother. - And I will come in the truck. - Okay. Do one thing find out the shares of Surya Electronics and Bajaj. Nihaal, I am very sorry about your father's death. - How did it happen? - But why are you vacating the house so soon. Look, father honestly served the government for 25 years. Today, when he is no more. The government cannot give his family.. ..six months time to stay in government office. In just 15 days they stand here with the lock. Sir, according to rule the government gives one day's time. We still gave them 15 days grace.. You did a great favor on us. Nihaal. - He thinks himself to be a collector. - Nihaal, now you are no more collectors' son. - Yes. You eill have to make your own Nihaal Joshi's identity. And I am sure that you will really make it. Thank you daddy. But son till then you will have to forget everything that.. ..you got because of collectors position. Daddy, Apoorva is with me. I can tolerate any situation when she is with me. I can bear any kind of problem when she is with me. Son, I think you did not understand what I am saying. Apoorva is one of them. Whom you were going to get because of collectors position. If all the things are not there in your life then how can Apoorva stay? Daddy, I cannot stay without Apoorva. What will I do without his support, daddy? Look son. If you really like Apoorva. Then do you want to see her working in one room kitchen cooking food. Or you want to see her happy getting married to any successful man. Yes, what? The rate of Surya Electronics has fallen. Then sell off the shares. What is the benefit of keeping the falling things? Okay. Okay, son. He does not want it but did he ask me that what I want. More than all these things I want your support. - Nihaal, I want to be with you. - Apoorva, listen.. - I want to be with you. - Apoorva, listen to me. - Listen to what I am saying Apoorva. - I want to be with you. Even I want to spend my entire life with you. Sit down. But not now. Apoorva, your father is a great man. Do you know that he is a great philosopher? He told me what is going to happen after marriage. Till yesterday I was collector Abhijit Joshi's son. After marriage I will be known as Apoorva Chaudhary's husband. When will I become Nihaal Joshi? You can become that even after marriage. No Apoorva. The entire desire, passion, hard work we need to fulfill our dreams.. ..is finished working for food. I cannot marry right now. Then tell me what I should do. At present I cannot think about anyone else except for me. Even you do not think about anyone else. Nihaal. No, I won't cry. Don't worry. I will not cry at all. What else can life do worst with me? I am absolutely fine. Look. See, I am laughing. I am laughing. I think it is time for you to leave. You should go otherwise you will get late. Will we not meet again? Of course we will meet. We will meet each other and smile. We will greet each other and leave. It is very late so go now. Go away from here. Go. - What is this? Has Apoorva gone? - Yes. Just put thread in this needle, son. - What happened? - I can't do it mother. Hey. I am your mother. But now I have to become your father also. Nihaal hadn't come out from the shock of his father's death. And you went and talked bitterly with him. Will the truth change by changing time and place? The bitterness could have been less. You very well know that I love him a lot. Listen Apoorva, don't mind my harshness. Even if you keep a dog in the house you get attached. But because of some attachment.. ..no one forgets the identity earned in 30 years. I am talking to someone for your marriage. The boy is ambitious. He has bought a company worth 50crores. He will help you take your companies further. And if that boy asks me that.. ..all this has been made by your grandfather but what is yours. Then what shall I answer him? Look Apoorva, if you don't want to marry the boy I have found for you.. ..then go to America for two years to do MBA You will forget everything after you go there. Not at all. I have never thought about my dreams. But today because of you I have realized that.. ..this bungalow, assets and everything can be snatched. Only your identity stays with you. I will become what I want to become.. You keep on explaining me in your way.. ..and I will keep on explaining you in my way. If instead of doing your business of utensils or nut and bolt.. ..I want to become a director or journalist then can't I become. What about the things your grandfather had thought? Daddy, my grandfather saw a dream of 100crores.. ..worth company sitting on the footpath. And he fulfilled it. I am proud of him. But would his soul rest in peace.. ..seeing that his granddaughter.. ..is living a life of a loser forgetting her dreams. He will never be proud of me. 98, 99, 100. 101, 102. 103, 104. 105, 106. 107, 100.. 109, 110. Hey, you had promised to increase five every day. Promise. Come on do it. 111. You still have to do many things after getting released from jail. So your health should be fine. 114, Come up, slowly. 115. What happened? The weight has increased too much. I had dreamt of lifting this burden. It is not a burden. I felt as if colorful butterfly was sitting on my back. Is this sleeping time? What are you looking at? Get up and work outside. Get up. The van is standing outside. Get to work straight away. Come on, everyone sit in the van. Come on, come on, everyone Everyone sit in the van. Even you move. - Come on, come on. - Hurry up. - Hey, come on. - Everyone move towards the van. - Hey, come on hurry up. - Hey, come on move ahead. With great grief we are informing you that.. ..your son Malhaar is missing because of a bus accident. Assuming he is dead we are closing his file. Jail superintendent Sharad Imre. Now neither Prithvi Raaj Kapoor nor Balraaj Sahni is alive. No one is bothered about theatre. Mr. Anna if you would have sold it to Mansukhani.. ..then you would have spent rest of your life comfortably. The theatre will come to us even now. Buying it in auction I will make Mansukhani shopping center here. But you are in loss for no reason, Anna. He has lost theatre and so many loans is now on his head. Which all doors will you close after sky? Now keep watching the drama that I will play on the stage of this world. She is lost even in so many crowds. Nice quality. - Colonel Rathi. - Hi, Mrs. Chawla. Hello. Mrs. Sofia, my assistant and companion. Hello Sofia, how are you? I will not ask permission to sit. Formality has made man a stranger that.. ..people have got lost in their own lives. We army men live in the moment and do not have time for formality. - The advertisement for marriage.. - I had given. And I am fortunate that you replied to it. Look, we have to find the happiness of life in advertisements. Actually I had become really alone after Mr. Chawla's death. - That is why I replied to your.. - Even I was married. Oh really. Then what happened? After the assasination of Mrs. Indira our house.. ..was one of the houses that were burnt in Delhi. Oh no. This usually happens in our country. After the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi the houses Brahmans were burnt. After the assassination of Mrs. Indira the Sikhs were burnt. Our nation becomes blind by getting trapped in emotions. What will you have? Even Mrs. Indira had asked the same question. What will you have? I had answered bullets, gunpowder and weapons. After the war of 1971. Were you present in the 71 war? 20kms away from Lahore. If Mrs Indira had given one signal then Lahore would have been at her feet. But an agreement took place. We were called back. Do you know how much blood of soldiers is there in the ink of the agreement? Yes mam. - Large rum with ice. - Okay sir. Colonel, which other fights have you fought? For a soldier every moment is a fight. Then whether there is enemy in front or someone's beautiful eyes. Whether it is battlefield or someone's beautiful body. Our hands have so much talent that.. ..they can carve any body and make it Taj Mahal. And so much gun powder is also filled in their hands.. ..that they can break a strong fort. How do you break a fort, colonel Rathi? We knock before destroying it. If knocks are not answered then we attack. And what do you do of those forts.. ..which are waiting for years for some knocks or attacks. We accept their invitation. Chandra Manek Shah had once told me not to believe women ever. They are death for men. If we accept them then they kill us by making us husbands. And if we reject them then by making us crazy. You are a great killer. You correctly recognized me. I feel your intentions are very dangerous. They don't seem to be dangerous but they are dangerous. Really. What do you want to do? Your murder. It is acceptable to me. Madam, food. Police control room. Hello. Police control room. Hello. Madam, will you please tell what is going on there. Hello, tell me. Hello, police control. Hey, get away. Get a side. Side.. A lot of lightning is taking place. I think it is going to rain. No sir, the flash of the cameras is shining. What are you saying? Why don't you wear your spectacles? What are you talking about spectacles? Don't I know the flash of the cameras is shining? Can't you understand such a small joke? Policemen become very serious. If policemen were serious.. ..then people who are dying one after the other would never die. - Go and do your work. Make a search. - Yes sir. Unnecessarily they have joined police. It would have been better if he was a singer. You are a stranger, so how can you be with me. These rich people do not have value of money. What is happening, sir? This is a very expensive perfume. If you smell it you will become unconscious. Then make me smell it. So, you have become unconscious. - The position of the right hand. - Yes. Sir, commissioner sir. - Good morning sir. - Good morning. Carry on. Sir, I feel it is an open theft case. The servant got an opportunity and made the owner unconscious. And then killed her. And then ran away with the jewellery. Sir, he is absolutely right. Sir, but I can see the presence of the third man in this case. - Really? A military officer. Look here, sir. These are footprints of shoes. These are military shoes but this man did not belong to military. - Why? Because this sole design stopped manufacturing after 1971 war. It is quite clear from this that.. ..he has bought these shoes from theft market. Look here, sir. There are two glasses of alcohol. This shows that Mrs. Chawla was so close to that man.. ..she could drink with him openly. There is food there so it means it was dinner party. One minute sir. Listen to this. Listening to this cassette it seems.. ..Mrs. Chawla was in a very romantic mood that night. It could be possible that the servant.. ..might have killed Mrs. Chawla after that man left. Sir, if he was a guest then he would had food and then gone. Plates have been laid on dining table but the food has not been eaten. It could be possible that the man first killed Mrs. Chawla. And then kidnapped the servant. No sir. the fingerprints on those plates belong to the servant. The same fingerprints are also on this stool with.. ..which Mrs. Chawla has been killed. Good. Yes Rahim Khan. Sir, this bottle contains medicine to make someone unconscious. - Medicine to make unconscious? - It is very powerful sir. Sir, I think this is the medicine.. ..that was used to make those women unconscious. - Send it to the lab. - Okay. Nihaal, as you have done so much analysis.. ..then you must be aware of who the killer is? - I know sir. - Who? Sir, he is the same cheater who has looted three women.. ..in the last one month by changing his appearance. He is the same man. I have prepared a report on him. Good. Very good. Sir, these are the old newspapers. There is marking on advertisement. - Shall I read? - Yes, read. A Sikh military officer wants a wife. - Retired Sikh military officer.. - That confirms it, sir. Good, good very good Nihaal. - I am proud of you. - Thank you, sir. I hand over this case of catching this actor. Thank you, sir. Look Nihaal. Don't get worried. Listen to me as of now. This often happens. Commissioner sir.. He will write whatever you have said there and will take the entire credit. Really he is a mean fellow. He is a rascal. Sir, where shall I give these photographs? Go and give it in the police station. Why are you after me? Listen, friend. Listen. This commissioner is a rascal. He is useless fellow. I cannot explain it to you. No one can stand in front of him. He is a hen pecked husband. And is scared of his wife. And he remains angry in front of us. He always gets on to us with full force. I swear my friend if.. ..he was boss of my father.. ..then my father would have never let me join police. I swear I sing qawali so well. Altaaf Raja who is so famous today. If I was there on his place then I swear I would be popular. You are a foreigner. How will you be mine? - Inspector Rahim Khan. - Yes, brother. What happened? My wife scolds me in my house. I am a hen pecked husband at home. I get onto you with full force. Come and meet me in the car. Get a side. Get ready. Okay. - Apoorva! - Oh My God. Come on Gajan hurry up. Don't be scared. Come with me. - Apoorva, don't go. - Press, press. - Excuse me. - Get a side. - Press. - Get a side. Press. Is commissioner inside? Gajan, take this. Fast. We can't lose this. Okay. - He is coming, coming. - Yes. - Excuse me, sir. I am from the press. - Yes. - From back. - Yes. Sir, we have come to know that.. ..Mrs. Chawla has been murdered in this house. Yes, she was murdered last night. What do you think who is responsible for this murder? Is there any connection with the illegal business of her husband Mr. Chawla. No, no it is a case of plain robbery. A person by wearing a military dress came to this house as a guest. He killed Mrs. Chawla and looted her belongings.. ..and ran away with her maid servant. Isn't it possible that the man and the maid servant know each other? No. because he is the same culprit.. ..who has looted four other women in the city. In different appearances. But in the same way by making them unconscious. And not by murdering. Great sir. So much progress in so less time. Mumbai police has really become smart. - Excellent work. - That is there. - Good job. - Enough of your work. - Come on. Move on. - Hey, don't touch the camera.. We will meet again. Greet each other and smile. We will greet each other and go away. Hi. - Nihaal. - You? Police inspector. - I don't believe this. - Stop it. This is personal, buddy. How come you are here? Didn't you see my show on the TV? 'Wajood' Policemen do not have so much money that.. ..they can afford a television at home. Why? Don't you take bribe? Bribe no, no. If your college gathering is over then shall we do some work. Sir I forgot to tell you. Her name is Apoorva Chaudhary. We know each other from very long. Our parents' had fixed our marriage also. So as it is rightly said no one can harm a person whom God saves. So I was saved. Sir, seriously we would like to thank you. You are welcome. Inspector Haq, come with me. - Come closer. - Yes. Who else have you told the matters of my home? - No one, sir. - Surely no one. I spoke just like that. But believe me I have a lot of respect in my heart for you. - Do you have respect? - Yes. - Then keep it with you. - Yes. Never say these things to anyone in the department. - Never. I swear I will never say it. - Get lost. - Yes. - Come on. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. What happened, sir? Nothing. The commissioner's wife and their. Anything you would like to add, sir. No. So God. They got separated because of me and met again because of me. They will again be separated because of me. It is still interval now. What have you see yet? I will make his life hell. Oh shit. Send her in. Sir, I have got fantastic news for tomorrow's newspaper. Oh no this news can be published in the newspaper day after also. Sit down first. You sit down. But sir.. Sit down. You are looking very smart. I like it. As it is our staff should look smart and glamorous. Thank you, sir. I was.. Why are you calling me, sir? We are colleagues, buddy. Why? Isn't it? By the way you are wearing a very nice shirt. Doesn't your wife wear a shirt? No, she doesn't. You should have a good figure to wear such shirt. You should have proper curves and figure. And she does not. Do you know once you had worn a red sari? Your figure looked superb in that. And the flowers that you had put on your hair. You were looking so sexy. So sexy, buddy. Really sexy. Yes sister-in-law. Did you hear? Yes, yes he was praising you. Sure, one minute. Sister-in-law. Hello, yes I was praising you. What should I tell you that how I was praising you? Sir, shall I tell? I remember it completely. That curves, that figure. - Shut up. You go out. Even you can go. This news should be published in tomorrow's newspaper. Understood. Today's latest news. Today's latest news. Actor Aflatoon's new stunt. He did a great stunt. Today's latest news. Very exciting. Police has a doubt that the same person is responsible.. ..for Mrs. Chawla's murder last night who has earlier looted three women. No one knows who he is and how he looks. He might just be your neighbor sitting in bus, park, and hotel. The information.. The thing that is being said. What? What are you finding in the paper for last half an hour? The address of any woman. What nonsense are you talking? Manner less. Manner less? Then who are you? You commit murders and loot, rascal. Leave him. If I find that idiot and I would have pressed his neck. Inspector, you just agree to anyone. Someone calls you and says that I am the culprit. Depending on that you come to my house and start making search. You start the search. All the society members are making fun of us. Look, by doing this search we are just being cautious. So that women like you can be saved from that culprit. That is why police is using its entire power. I just stole from his pocket and you are being strict. If you have the powers then go and catch him who robs others during daytime. To reach him we will have to first find out.. ..where the servant was working earlier. But Rane I cannot understand that why did she suddenly kills her master. I never liked Mrs. Chawla. She needed a new man every day. I did not like it. I liked you.. ..the moment I saw you. I did not want her to touch you. Why did you like me? Should there be any reason necessary to like someone? Bright girl. Bright. Are you from Mumbai? I am not from Mumbai. But from Latur. A terrible earthquake took place there four years ago. Because of that earthquake my family and parents' were killed. My entire village was buried under the ground. When I went to the government office.. ..to get help for the victims of earthquake. I could not prove it to them that my name is Shalini. And I stayed in Rajawadi. Every man there tried to take undue advantage of me. Because not a single man was alive in this world who recognized me. People get a second life after death. But God gave me another life in this birth. Then I came to the city to make my new identity. And then started working at Chawla's as Sofia. "The cloud of hair opened on the mountains."

I Apoorva Chaudhary welcome you all to this program 'Wajood' The sponsor of this program is Tata tea. Come have tea full of freshness. Tata tea. Only Tata Tea. Only freshness. Come, let's come to know him with the statement of these three women. They replied to his marriage advertisement published in the newspaper. And got trapped in his plan. This city is very eager to know about that person. Mrs. Malhotra, he met you in the form of a surgeon, right? - Yes. So can you tell our audience that.. ..being a doctor why couldn't you recognizes his truth? How can I make you believe that his actions.. ..nature, his habits and even his hands looked like that of a surgeon? Mrs. Gupta will you share your experience with him? His knowledge about music really surprised me. He used to sing musical notes in such a way that.. ..seemed Birju Maharaj was singing live. The happiness that I got dancing to his tunes.. ..was never experienced by me earlier. Mrs. Malhotra, what if he wishes to meet you again? I will surely meet him. And you will hand him over to police. No, I will forgive him. And you will accept him. Yes. Apoorva, shall I ask you a question? Please ask. If you meet that man again whom you loved earlier but he cheated you. Or he moved on the wrong path. Then what will you do? If I really love him then I will try to bring him on the right path. I will not reject him. The question is that if he is so capable then why he is doing all this. For money, popularity or he is a frustrated actor.. ..who did not get chance to play the characters he liked on the stage. And he is taking revenge from the society. Or maybe he is successful but it is the wrong means to get his identity. I leave the decision on you. I shall meet you next week. With people who continue to find their identity.. ..in your favorite program 'Wajood' The sponsor of this program was Tata salt. Run the terror has come. She has eyes on every food. What kind of salt is this? Don't waste money. Tata Salt. - Vacuum evaporated. - Yes. Extra energy. - Yes. Even iodized. - Yes. No one can make such pure salt. Only Tata Salt has this. When put in food everyone appreciates. Salt should always be Tata Salt. Hello, tell me. - I am Apoorva Chaudhary speaking. - Hello. I saw your interview yesterday. I really liked it. Thank you. Take this. It is fantastic the way you have analyzed that incident. It seems as if you were also once connected with stage. You understand the mental condition of an actor. Hello, I think there is some disturbance. - No, that is by birth. - Yes? Don't you think he wants to prove something to someone? Yes, might be. If that is the case then he may now do bigger crimes. Like bank robbery. Hello, who is speaking? Tell this to inspector Nihaal. He might be able to stop it. But who are you? - Hitchcock. - What? Hitchcock. Hitchcock. - Wait madam. - Is manager inside? The bank opens at 8:30 madam. No, no I am his sister-in-law. I have come from out station. Okay, okay go. 'Sanskrit chants' 'Sanskrit chants' Has my letter come?

Lie down on the ground. Leave her, leave her. Leave her. You should not hold a woman like this. Go, go. No man can hold a woman like this. Only Othello can hold Destimona. No one else. Pots! Pots! So what color jacket was he wearing? - Sir, he was wearing a red color jacket. - Red? No sir, he was wearing a green jacket. - No, sir it was red. - No, sir it was green. You don't know..it was red. - No, sir, she doesn't know. I do. - Red.. - Quiet! They saw him. Stop it..you always contradict me. - You do it too. How do you know? You were in the room combing your hair. Come, mister. Past, present, future..job, marriage, love..family.. ..my dear bird will tell you everything. He'll make your future bright. He'll make your life better, Make things better for you, for only 5 rupees. - I don't know, sir. - Excuse me. Yes. I guess you're a experienced, senior police officer. What do you think? This criminal who robbed 1.5 million rupees and fled.. ..what steps will the police have to take to catch him? I think the police should announce a reward.. ..and the people can help us in apprehending him. Of course, he's not going to do anything. What will be the reward? - Reward.. - 200,000? - 200,000. - 200,000. Don't tell the press about it.. what is this? - Mic? - I.. What's all this about a reward? If we give 200,000 and recover 1.5 million.. ..don't we still profit 1.3 million? Use your head. Please leave.. leave.. You guys don't help the police. In fact, you make things difficult for us with your rubbish news. If you talk calmly.. ..then even I can give you few clues about this bank robbery. What? I got a very strange call yesterday. First he congratulated me for interviewing those three women. And then he said that the culprit's next step.. ..can be robbing a bank. And that's what happened. You never listen to me, Apurva. This is exactly like I predicted. You warned him with your interview..he thanked you.. ..and changed his technique. What else did he say? Nothing. Young man, this is destined. No one can change it. Mallahr..thanks to your contribution.. ..we saved this theatre from being razed down. "How do I tell you.." "You're my religion..my faith." "You're my devotion..you're my love." "You're my desire." You work so hard. Spend some time for yourself. If you want..we can go out for dinner. - Or we can see a movie together. - No, sir. I will look odd going out with you and your wife. No need.. Didn't you see Yash Chopra's film 'Daag' on television yesterday? What a film. I am a fan..especially that song. "What's in my heart..if you want I can tell you." Rajesh Khanna's lover is Sharmila Tagore. And his wife is Rakhi. And in the climax.. Rajesh Khanna.. ..keeps Rakhi and Sharmila Tagore together. They all stay together, where is the problem. If two can live happily, then why not three. Absolutely right, sir. And why just three. We've examples where six live together happily too. What are you saying? That's fantastic. Who is the lucky person? Draupadi and the 5 Pandavas. Correct. I've decided, I will call sister-in-law and tell her.. ..if one Mr. Sanyal can keep you so happy. Then imagine what four more can do? What do you mean? Sir, if you're a big fan of Yash Chopra's 'Daag'.. ..then I am a big fan of BR Chopra's 'Mahabharat'. Should I call sister-in-law. - No. No need. - She must be at home? - Apurva. - I am going out. There is someone waiting for you at the lobby. Excuse me, sir. Apurva, you suspected that the man calling you is the culprit. We've taped your phone to find him. Whoever calls you now, his conversation will get recorded. Our man is sitting at the telephone exchange. And he will tell us who is calling you. Understand. But you must keep him busy until we don't find him. Obviously, that's one way to catch him. Understand. Imagine that he calls..and you recognize his voice. You will tell Kanchan. And Kanchan will tell us where he's calling from. Understood. Let's do a demonstration. Let's do a demonstration. Answer the phone. Come on. - Hello. - Hello. It's him. Very good. What will you do now? - No, it's him. - Who? - The guy that keeps calling me. - Oh. - Just keep talking to him. - But.. - Keep talking to him. - What do I say? - Hello, who is it? - What's in the name?

What's he saying? Hello. Rahim Khan, where is he? - Gate of India. - Okay. These days until you don't publish few murders, rapes.. ..or robberies on the first page people can't digest their food. And you put me on page 3. This is not fair. Absolutely ridiculous. No way. - I.. - This is how you treat friends. Sorry, it was a mistake. After this all my news should be on page one. Please. Please, I request you. Please. I'll see what I can do. I am very sure..if the press and criminals work together.. ..we both can progress. You'll sell more papers and I will get famous.

Use it. {ROARS SOFTLY} Now here is a monster who looks like a Scarer. You want a hope of passing this class, you better eat, breathe, and sleep Scaring. {CLICKS TONGUE} {UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING} {STUDENTS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY} {ALL CHEERING} Yeah! MIKE= Give me another one. Fear of spiders. Arachnophobia. Fear of thunder. Keraunophobia. Fear of chopsticks! Consecotaleophobia. What is this, kindergarten? Give me a hard one. {DRUM ROLL} {CROWD CHEERING} CHEERLEADERS= Go Monsters U! You know what to do! {BOTH GRUNT} {ALL GRUNTING} {ALL CHEERING} The answer is C, fangs. Well done, Mr. Wazowski. A bowl of spiders! Correct! A clown running in the dark! Right again. Warts, boils, and moles, in that order. KNIGHT= Outstanding! Ah! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ah! {CONTINUES ROARING} Ogre slump. {ROARS SOFTLY} Zombie snarl. Dominant silverback gorilla. That is some remarkable improvement, Michael. {ROARS SOFTLY} One frightening face does not a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan. {CLICKS TONGUE} A Tauntaun grimace with extra slobber. You got it! That's what I'm saying. I am going to wipe the floor with that little know-it-all. Yes, you are, big blue. Hey, wait. What are you guys... It's just a precaution. rors are the best Scarers on campus, Sullivan. Can't have a member getting shown up by a beach ball. Whoo-hoo! I am on a roll. I'm going to destroy that guy. Well, then you'll get this back right away. It's time to start delivering on that Sullivan name. Today's final will judge your ability to assess a child's fear and perform the appropriate Scare in the Scare Simulator. {DOOR CREAKING} {STUDENTS MURMURING} The Child Sensitivity Level will be raised from Bed-wetter to Heavy Sleeper, so give it everything you've got. Dean Hardscrabble is with us this morning to see who will be moving on in the Scaring program and who will not. Let's get started. I am a five-year-old girl afraid of spiders and Santa Claus. Which Scare do you use? Uh... That's a Seasonal Creep and Crawl. Demonstrate. {BELL DINGS} Results will be posted outside my office. Next. Focus. Johnson, Crackle and Howl. Yes! {DOOR OPENS} {MONSTER ROARS} {DUMMY KID SCREAMS} Hey. Do you mind? Don't mind at all. {ROARS SOFTLY} Come on, Mike. Let's just move. Stay out of my way. Unlike you, I had to work hard to get into the Scare program. That's because you don't belong here. {ROARS LOUDLY} That's what I thought. {ROARING SOFTLY} {BOTH ROARING} Whoa! Whoa... {ALL GASP} {ALL GASPING} {SCREAMS ESCAPING} {ALL GASPING} {ALL SIGHING IN RELIEF} {BOTH GASP} I'm so sorry. It was an accident. What? This? My one souvenir from a lifetime of Scaring? Accidents happen, don't they. The important thing is no one got hurt. You're taking this remarkably well. Now, let's continue the exams. Mr. Wazowski, I'm a five-year-old girl on a farm in Kansas afraid of lightning. Which Scare do you use? Shouldn't I go up on the... Which Scare do you use? That is a Shadow Approach with a Crackle Holler. Demonstrate. Stop. Thank you. But I didn't get to... I've seen enough. I'm a seven-year-old boy... {ROARS LOUDLY} I wasn't finished. I don't need to know any of that stuff to scare. That "stuff" would've informed you that this particular child is afraid of snakes. So a roar wouldn't make him scream, it would make him cry, alerting his parents, exposing the monster world, destroying life as we know it, and of course we can't have that. So I'm afraid I cannot recommend that you continue in the Scaring program. Good day. Wait, what? But I'm a Sullivan. Well then, I'm sure your family will be very disappointed. {FOOTSTEPS RETREATING} {STUDENTS MURMURING} {MURMURING CONTINUES} And, Mr. Wazowski, what you lack is something that cannot be taught. You're not scary. You will not be continuing in the Scaring program. Please. Let me try the simulator. I'll surprise you. Surprise me? I doubt that very much. {WIND WHOOSHING} SCREAM-CAN PROFESSOR= Welcome back. I hope everyone had a pleasant bre. Some say that a career as a scream-can designer is boring, unchallenging, a waste of a monster's potential. {INHALES DEEPLY} Open your textbooks to chapter three. We will now plunge into the rich history of scream-can design. {STUDENTS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY} Out of my way! Coming through! Oh, sorry. Ha-ha! Welcome to this year's Greek Scare Games kickoff. The Scare Game! Yeah! {MARCHING BAND PLAYING} We have a special guest, the founder of the games, Dean Hardscrabble. {CROWD CHEERING} Good afterno. As a student, I created these gas as a friendly competition, but be prepared. To take home the troph, you must be the most fearsome monsters on campus. {RORS CHUCKLING} So good luck, and may the best monsters wi. We're closing down sign-, so we'll see you all... MIKE= Wait! I'm signing up! {CROWD LAUGHING} What? Uh... You have to be in a fraterniy to compete. Behold the next winning fraternity of the Scare Games, the brothers, my brothers, of Oozma Kappa! Hi. Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing? You just said the winners are the most fearsome monsters on campus. If I win, it means you kicked out the best Scarer in the whole school. That won't happen. How about a little wager? If I win, you let me back in the Scaring program. And what would that prove? That you were wrong. {ALL GASP} Very well. If you win, I will let your entire team into the Scare program. But if you lose, you will leave Monsters University. {CROWD MURMURING} Deal. Now all you need to do is find enough members to compete. We need six guys, right? MALE ANNOUNCER= Sorry, chief. We count bodies, not heads. That dude counts as one. {CROWD LAUGHING} Anybody else want to join our team? Anyone at all? Excuse me. Sorry. I'm late. Can I squeeze by you? Randy! Randy, thank goodness. I need you on my team. Oh. Sorry. I'm already on a team. Boggs. I'm finally in with the cool kids, Mike. Don't blow this for me. Do the thing. Oh! Where did he go? {ALL LAUGH} Please, anybody. I need one more monster. Just one more! Yeah, sorry. Doesn't look good. We have to move on. Your team doesn't qualify. Yes, it does! The star player has just arrived. No way! Someone else! Please! Anyone else. We're shutting down sign-ups, okay? Is he on your team or not? FEMALE MONSTER= Come on! Let's go! Fine! Yes, he's on my team. Good luck. All right, Wazowski, what's the plan? This is a fraternity house? Hey there, teammateys! Come on aboard! As the president of Oozma Kappa, it is my honour to welcome you to your new home. We call this room "Party Central. " Technically, we haven't actually had a party here yet. But when we do, we'll be ready! Whoo! The hot cocoa train is coming through! Whoa! Next stop... You! {CUPS RATTLING} I would like to start us off first by... So, you guys are Scaring majors? Wewere! None of us lasted very long. I guess we just weren't what old Hardscrabble was looking for. Don Carlton, mature student. Thirty years in the textile industry and then old dandy Don got downsized. Figured I could throw myself a pity party, or go back to school and learn the computers. Hello. I'm Terry with a "Y"... And I'm Terri with an "I"! I'm a dance major! AndI 'mnot. Five, six, seven, eight! Seven, eight, turn! And... Why didn't you turn? Because we never agreed to do this! You said this was going to be cool! No one said this was gonna be cool. Now I'm embarrassed. Now you're embarrassed? Yes, because it's in front of people! You should wake up embarrassed. Hey, hey, hey! I'm Art! New Age philosophy major. Excited to live with you and laugh with you, and cry with you. Thought you might like to keep a dream journal. Guess that leaves me. Ah! My name's Scott Squibbles. My friends call me Squishy. I'm undeclared, unattached, and unwelcome pretty much everywhere but here. Now that we've all been introduced, as captain of our team... So, basically, you guys have no Scaring experience? Nota lot! But now we've got you! You're about the scariest fella I've ever seen. Even with them pink polka dots. Aw, thanks. Actually, I think I bring the whole package. Your hands are as big as my face! He's like a mountain with fur! Oh, come on. I don't even work out. Yeah, me neither. I don't want to get too big. We thought our dreams were over, but Mike said if we win, they're letting us in the Scaring program. We're going to be real Scarers! The best! You betcha! Yeah! Right. And here's what you've been waiting for, fellas. Your very own Oozma Kappa bedroom. Oh... Great! We're sharing this room? We'll let you guys get settled. Anything you need, you just give a big holler-oonie! Okay, thanks, buddy. Are you kidding me? Look, they don't need to be good. I'm going to carry the whole team. Really? And who's going to carry you? Hey, if you want to go back to can design, you know where the door is. {FLICKING LIGHT SWITCH} Great. Guys? Anybody home? Um... Hello? Fellas? Do you pledge your souls to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood? Ow! Do you swear to keep secret all that you learn here? No matter how horrifying? Hey! Will you take the sacred oath of the... For crying out loud. Sweetie! Turn the lights on while you're down here! You're going to ruin your eyes! Mom! We're doing an initiation! Oh, scary. Well, carry on. Just pretend I'm not here. This is my mom's house. Do you promise to look out for your brothers... {DIAL CRANKING} ...no matter what the peril? {WASHING MACHINE WHIRRING} Will you defend Oozma Kappa no matter how dangerous? No matter how insurmountable the odds may be? From evils both great and small? In the face of unending pain and... Oh, forget it! You're in. Look, we know we're no one's first choice for a fraternity, so it means a lot to have you here with us. Can't wait to start Scaring with you, brothers. {ALL CHEERING} Time for a celebration! Yeah! Grab the couch cushions, gentlemen, because we're building a fort! Mom, can we stay up late tonight? {MIKE AND SULLEY SNORING} Mmm, I know you're a princess and I'm just a stable boy. {ALARM BUZZES} Yuck! Mom! What are you doing? Your grubby paw was in my bed! Were you kissing my hand? {LAUGHS NERVOUSLY} No. And what about you with all your shedding? I don't shed. Really. Uh... Excuse me. I just want to get my stuff. Would you just... Oh, hey. Come on! ...let me get my stuff! {MIKE YELPS} SULLEY= My butt! {BOTH GROANING} {CAMERA CLICKS} First morning in the house. That's going in the album! Guys! We got a letter! A letter? TERRI= We never get mail. Oh! Sorry. It's stuck. Would you... Give me that! Tentacles. They're sticky. It'sthefirstevent of the Scare Games. {ALL GASPING} "A child's room is where you scare, "but avoid the toxicity lurking there. " Wait a minute. Where do they want us to meet? Of all the sewers on campus, this one has always been my favourite. Art, you've been here before? I have a life outside of the house, you know. {CROWD CHEERING} Welcome to your worst nightmare, the Scare Games! {CHEERING CONTINUES} CROWD= Scare Games! Scare Games! Yes! Yes, I love it! I love this energy! Okay. Okay, everybody. FEMALE ANNOUNCER= Let's hear it for the frats and sororities competing in this year's games... Jaws Theta Chi! {ALL CHEER} MALE ANNOUNCER= Python Nu Kappa! Slugma Slugma Kappa! {ALL GRUNT} MALE ANNOUNCER= Roar Omega Roar! {ALL ROARING} FEMALE ANNOUNCER= Eta Hiss Hiss! And finally, Oozma Kappa. Yay! Whoo-hoo! Hi, Mom! Smile! {CAMERA CLICKS} Let's begin the first competition, the Toxicity Challenge! {ALL CHEERING} Human children are toxic! And anything they touch is toxic. MALE ANNOUNCER= We don't have any human toys, but thanks to MU's biology department, we found a close second, the stinging glow urchin! {ALL GASP} {ALL MURMURING} Trust me when I say, you are not gonna want to touch this bad boy! I want to touch it. And you certainly don't want to touch any of its friends. {ALL GASP} Yeah, I want to touch them. This is the starting line. The light at the end of the tunnel is the finish line. And whoever comes in last is eliminated from the games. Mike... Whatisit ? Does that mean if we lose, we're out? Don't worry, Smoothie. Squishy! Squishy. We're not going to lose, because we have everything we need to win right here. Heart. No! Me. I'm going to win the race for us. SULLEY= All right, all right. That's very cute, It's an obstacle course. What are you going to do? Roar at it? I can get through faster thank you, little guy. Take your place at the starting line! This is all about teamwork. Everybody, stick together. I'm going to beat you over that finish line. Get ready to eat my dust. Hey, guys, should we huddle up? Attention, teams. One last thing. Scarers work in the dark. I want to go home! On your marks... Hey, uh, good luck, ladies. Thanks! We're going to rip you to pieces! What? {ALL HISSING} {BOTH GASP} MALE ANNOUNCER=... get set... Go! {ALL YELLING} I'm going to touch them! {ALL PANTING} Ow! Come on! Uh, guys! We're falling behind a little! Fellas! Cheese and crackers! Son of a moustache! Salisbury steak, that hurts! Is that as fast as you can go? Just getting started! What the... {CROWD JEERING} Whoa! Ah! Oh... Ah! That's got to hurt! Ow,ow,ow ... Ooh! Terry! Don't worry, we'll be fi... {BOTH SCREAM} {BOTH GROAN} {BOTH SNIGGER} Ha-ha! Oh... Uh-oh. Yikes! Ow! Ow, ow, ow... {BOTH PANTING} MALE ANNOUNCER= Roar Omega Roar wins! {BOTH GRUNT} {BOTH ROARING} {BOTH GROAN} {BOTH PANTING} Take that, Wazowski! Are you delirious? I beat you! Get your eye checked! Oh, way to blow it, Oozmas! Hey! Second place ain't bad. MALE ANNOUNCER= Second place, Jaws Theta Chi! What? Your whole team has to cross the finish line. MALE ANNOUNCER= Third place, eeks! Fourth place, PNKs! MIKE= No. Fifth place, HSS! No, no, no! MALE ANNOUNCER= And in last place, Oozma Kappa. I can't feel my anything. Oh... Shocker! Oozma Kappa has been eliminated! No. {BREATHING HEAVILY} Don't look so surprised, Mr. Wazowski. It would have taken a miracle for you to... Attention, everyone. We have an announcement. Jaws Theta Chi has been disqualified. {ALL GASP} The use of illegal protective gel is cause for elimination. What! Which means Oozma Kappa is back in the games! It's a miracle! Your luck will run out, eventually. This is going to be harder than I thought. MIKE= Okay! Listen up, Oozmas. Now, we're going to have to start winning these things together, so that means I'm going to need each of you guys to pull your own weight. Mike? Whatisit ? We've made a list of our strengths and weaknesses. In high school, I was the master of the silent scare. I could sneak up on a field mouse in a pillow factory. Sorry! They get stickier when I'm sweaty. Oh, my gosh, that's terrible. We're experts in the ancient craft of close-up magic. It's all about misdirection. Uh... I have an extra toe. Not with me, of course. Guys, one slip-up on the next event, and we're goners. So for this to work, I'm gonna need you to take every instinct you have and bury it deep, deep down. Done. From now on, we are of one mind. My mind. Oh, please. I will tell you exactly what to do, and how to do it. ALL= Uh... Okay, Mike. Seems about right. All right. Give me scary steps. Fifty up and down, right now. Let's go! You're wasting your time. We need a new team. Wecan'tjust "get a new team"! I checked this morning. It's against the rules. What if we disguised a new team to look like the old team? Oh, no, no. We are not cheating. It's not cheating. I'm just, you know, levelling the playing field. Okay, so it's kind of cheating, but what do you want me to do? They're not exactly the scariest group in the world. Oh, a ladybug! Make a wish! Make a wish! {ALL CHUCKLING} This is not going to work. Where are you going? We're training. I'm a Sullivan. That's not enough. You're all over the place. You're charging ahead when you... Bup, bup, bup! You tell them what to do but not me. So long, Coach. {CLICKS TONGUE} {BOTH GIGGLING} Okay, Oozmas... Boy, we need to get you a bell. Listen up. "If a kid hears you coming, they'll call Mom or Dad, "then you'd better run fast or things will get bad. " Huh? In the next event, if even one of us gets caught, we're all out. So remember, do exactly what I do. FEMALE ANNOUNCER= We are at the halfway point of the second event, and things are getting interesting. Gotit. FEMALE ANNOUNCER= Only two teams left. Who will make it out with their flag, and who will be eliminated? you do not want to get caught by a kid's parent. And in this event, you do not want to get caught by the librarian. Quiet. What'ssoscary about a little old librarian? {CHAIR CREAKS} I said, "Quiet. " {ALL LAUGHING} Faster. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. BOTH= Slow and steady. Slow and steady. {GRUNTS IN ANNOYANCE} Sullivan! Sullivan! {ALL SHUSHING} {ALL GROANING} {FLOORBOARD CREAKS} Hmm. Whew! Ooh! No! TERRI= Five, six, seven, eight! BOTH= Look over here! {TERRY CHUCKLING} {TERRI SINGING} {PLATES SHATTERING} Is that legal? You better believe it, mop top! The only rule is don't get caught. {CONTINUES LAUGHING} Whoo! {ALL GRUNTING} Ooh! BOTH= Hey! Over here! Come and get me! Come and get me! Whoo-hoo! Guys, what are you doing? They said don't let her catch you. But they didn't say how! Move it! Move it! Move it! Come on! {ALL SCREAM} ALL= Whoa! {ALL GRUNT} Whew! We did it! No, we didn't. We forgot the flag! SQUISHY= Mike? Way to go, Squishy! Way to go, Squishy! How? Misdirection. {LIBRARIAN GROWLS} {ALL SCREAMING} {ALL CHEERING} The eeks have been eliminated and Oozma Kappa live to scare another day! ALL= We're OK! We're OK! We're OK! SQUISHY= I've never felt so alive! TERRI= We were awesome! Okay, look. That wasn't real Scaring. It was better than what you did. You should've stuck to my strategy. Whatever. Talk to me when we start the real Scaring. {CAR HORN HONKS} Hey! You guys going to the party? Oh, I think you've got the wrong guys. We don't get invited to... Party? The mid-games mixer at the RORs'. It's for the top Scare Teams. {POP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO} See you there! {ALL GIGGLING} Did you hear that? I can't believe it! Uh-uh. Bad idea. This is great. They're finally seeing us as real Scarers. We're going! {DANCE MUSIC PLAYING} DON= Do young people still dance? Because my moves are a little rusty. Oh, we forgot to bring a hostess gift. We can't go in there without some scented candles. Calm down. We earned this. Whatifthere's a lull in the conversation? I never know what to... You know... Say? How are you so good at this? You just took on an angry 50-foot librarian, and you're afraid of a little party? Take a deep breath... {ALL INHALING DEEPLY} ...and in you go! {MUSIC STOPS} Hello. It's Oozma Kappa! These guys are crazy! What you did today was insane! MONSTER= That was awesome! {ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY} Oozma Kappa, tonight we party like Scarers! {ALL CHEER} {DANCE MUSIC PLAYING} I've never stayed up this late in my life! {GIRLS GIGGLING} {ALL CHEERING} {DANCE MUSIC FADES} {ROARS SOFTLY} Hey, quiet! Quiet! Quiet down, you can-wranglers. All right. On behalf of the RORs, we'd like to congratulate all the teams that have made it this far. {ALL CHEERING} All, right, let's hear it for the PNKs! {ALL HISSING} I love that trick! Never gets old. HSS! Very creepy. And finally, the surprise team of the Scare Games, Oozma Kappa! {ALL CHEERING} Now, I got to admit, fellas, I thought you were a bunch of nobodies. But, boy, was I wrong. Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa! CROWD= Oozma Kappa! Oh! What? The most adorable monsters on campus. CROWD= Ooh! Oh! {CROWD LAUGHING} Release the stuffed animals. {CHET CHUCKLES} Faced! Don't worry. Nobody reads the school paper. Yeah, but I'm pretty sure they read the quad. {MONSTERS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY} {ALL LAUGHING} MONSTER= Whoo-hoo! CHET= Thank you very much. Okay. Would you like that with two sleeves or four? Thanks. Tell your friends. Hey! What do you think you're doing? Raising a little money for charity. Yeah? Well, stop it. You want us to stop raising money for charity? That's not cool. This guy hates charity! I want you to stop making us look like fools. Hey, you're making yourselves look like fools. Let's be honest, boys. You're never going to be real Scarers, because real Scarers look like us. {LAUGHS MOCKINGLY} But, hey, if you really want to work for a Scare company they're always hiring in the mailroom. {CROWD LAUGHING} Guys, hold on! Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second. Don't listen to him. We just need to keep trying. No, you need to stop trying! You can train monsters like this all you want, but you can't change who they are. DON= Mike... We appreciate everything you've done, but he's right. No matter how much we train, we'll never look like them. We're built for other things. Sorry, squirt! Some monsters just aren't cut out for the big leagues. The big leagues. Guys. We're going on a little field trip. {ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY} TERRY= My tentacle fell asleep. Thanks, Mom. Have fun, kids! I'll just be here listening to my tunes. {THRASH METAL BLARING ON STEREO} Hey, uh, where are we? The big leagues. Holy roly-poly. Wow. Nice fence. This is amazing, Mike. We're not stopping here. SQUISHY= This is crazy. We're going to get arrested! {MIKE SHUSHING} Oh, wow. Whoa... Oh! FEMALE MONSTER ON PA= All Scare Floors now active. West coast coming online. Scarers coming out. SQUISHY= Look at them. They're going into the human world, and they don't even look scared! {CHILD SCREAMS} Wow. Take a good look, fellas. See what they all have in common? Uh... No, not really. Exactly. There's no one type of Scarer. The best Scarers use their differences to their advantage. Wow. Terri? Look. DON= Hey! Look at that old feller racking up the big numbers! Don, that old fella is Earl "The Terror" Thompson! What? Where? That's really him? MIKE= He held the Scare Record for three years! Oh! Third door from the end! MIKE= Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez! SULLEY= Look! It's "Screaming" Bob Gunderson! I still have his rookie card. Me, too! Doesn't have the speed anymore, but his technique is flawless. Technique is flawless. You collected Scare Cards, huh? Yep. 450 of them. Impressive. I have 6,000 still in mint condition, but, you know, 450 is pretty good, too. Hey, look at me! I'm Earl "The Terror" Thompson! Whoa! Oh, that's great! DON= That's a pretty good one, Squish. I've been a real jerk. So have I. But it's not too late. We could be a great team. We just need to start working together. SECURITY GUARD= Hey! What are you doing up there? I can't go back to jail! {ALARM BLARING} Come on! DON= They're right behind us! {ALL PANTING} Get back here! Up there! Get them! {ALL GRUNTING} ART= Whoo-hoo-hoo! Thanks, brother! Don't mention it. I'm fine, really! It's just a little heart attack. Aw... I want a piece of that action! {ALARM RINGING} {ALL PANTING} SQUISHY= Mom! Start the car! {BOTH GRUNTING} What? Start the car! Stop the bar? The car! Start the car! Oh! Okay. {CAR ENGINE STARTS} Come on, come on, come on, come on! Get in! Get in! Mom, go! Seatbelts. Okay, go! Does anyone want gum? Just drive! Okay. Here we go! {ALL SCREAMING} ART= Oh, yeah!

Oh, he's back! {ALL ROAR} {ALARM BUZZING} Wake up! Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight! Do I hear thirty-nine? MIKE= Come on! {SULLEY CONTINUES ROARING} MIKE= Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa, you're looking good. "To frighten a child is the point of a Scare. "If you frighten a teen, then Scarer beware. " Okay, scare the little kid. Avoid the teenager! FEMALE TEENAGER 1= I'm on the phone! MALE TEENAGER 1= No one understands me! MALE TEENAGER 2= Whatever. FEMALE TEENAGER 2= But, Daddy, I love him! {BELL DINGS} {CHILD SCREAMS} MALE ANNOUNCER= First place, Roar Omega Roar! Second place, Oozma Kappa! Whoo! MALE ANNOUNCER= Third place, HSS. {CROWD CHEERING} MALE TEENAGER 3= You're lame. "Someone is coming, this could ruin your night.

I cannot get down. Zombie snarl! Angry poodle. Jazz clown. My Aunt Phyllis. In the morning. That's what I'm talking about! {ALARM BUZZES} Time to go to work. You're out! You're out. Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle. {CROWD CHEERING} Thank you. {CROWD CHEERING LOUDLY} Yeah! Yeah! We're down to o remaining team, Roar Omega Rr and Oozma Ka! Which leads us to the final event! "Every one of your skills will be put to the test. "The Scare Simulator will prove who's the best!" Tomorrow night you finally get to Scare in front of the whole school! Enjoy the attention while it lasts, boys. After you lose, no one will remember you. Maybe. But when you lose, no one will let you forget it. Oh, boy. That is a good point. Hey, Oozmas, you guys are awesome! You've got to teach us your moves. Well, then you're gonna want to talk to this guy. Oh... Sure, I can teach you. All right. You want to hide behind the chair? You have to become the chair. MALE ANNOUNCER= Thanks for coming, Dean. Dean Hardscrabble! If we get back into the Scaring program, I hope there's no hard feelings. Tomorrow, each of you must prove that you are undeniably scary. And I know for a fact that one of you is not. No. He works harder than anyone. Do you think he's scary? He's the heart and soul of the team! Do you think he's scary? We're going to win this thing tomorrow, Sull, I can feel it! We'll finally have our lives back on track. Hey, Mike? You know, you've given me a lot of really great tips. I'd love to return the favour sometime. Oh. Yeah, sure. Anytime. {SULLEY GRUNTS} We're doing this now? Okay. You've memorized every textbook, every Scare Theory, and that is great. Hey! {CAT YOWLS} But now it's time to forget all that. Just reach deep down and let the scary out! Huh. Just feel it. Exactly. Go wild. I don't know. I've kind of got my own technique. Give it a try. Good, but bigger! Nope. You're thinking again. From the gut! Let the animal out! Come on! Dig deep! {ROARING LOUDLY} SHERRIE= Boys! It's a school night! So, how was that? Up top. Ha-ha! You know, it did feel different! I feel like it's all coming together. Yup, this time tomorrow the whole school is finally going to see what Mike Wazowski can do. You're darn right. ¶¶ Monsters University ¶¶ ¶¶ We give our heart to you ¶¶ ¶¶ Wherever ¶¶ ¶¶ children are dreaming ¶¶ ¶¶ We'll bring them ¶¶ ¶¶ nightmares, too ¶¶ ¶¶ Oh, Monsters University ¶¶ ¶¶ Alma Mater hail to you ¶¶ FEMALE ANNOUNCER= Welcome to the final competition of the Scare Game. {CROWD CHEERING} {MARCHING BAND PLAYING} Whoo!

FEMALE ANNOUNCER= First Scarers to the starting line. Okay, just like we planned. I'll go first. Then, Don... Hold on.

Why did you do this? Youknow, just in case. In case of what? You don't think I'm scary. Mike... You said you believed in me. But you're just like Hardscrabble. You're just like everyone else! Look, you'll get better and better... I'm as scary as you! I'm as scary as anyone! I just wanted to help. No. You just wanted to help yourself. Let the whole team fail because you don't have it? MALE DOOR TECHNICIAN= So your calculations were a little off. That door took me all semester. It's too dangerous. The professor's just going to shred it. {STUDENTS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY} Thereheis , the big guy. The first of many trophies, I am sure. KNIGHT= Sullivan. Nice work out there. I look forward to having you back in class. CHET= Hey, there he is! Looks like I was wrong about you. You're one of us after all. CHET= Way to go, Sulley! Welcome back, broham!

I thought if I wanted it enough, That Mike Wazowski is something special. And I'm just not. Look, Mike, I know how you feel. Don't do that! Please, don't do that! You do not know how I feel. Mike, calm down. Monsters like you have everything. You don't have to be good. You can mess up over and over again and the whole world loves you. Mike... You'll never know what it's like to fail because you were born a Sullivan! Yeah, I'm a Sullivan. I'm the Sullivan who flunked every test. The one who got kicked out of the program, the one who was so afraid to let everyone down that I cheated. And I lied. Mike, I'll never know how you feel, but you're not the only failure here. I act scary, Mike, but most of the time I'm terrified. How come you never told me that before? Because we weren't friends before. RANGER 3= Check the lake! RANGER 4= I heard something here!

But you can be sure we'll be watching these two. Always watching. Expelled? So, you're leaving? Yeah, buddy. We have to go. Harsh, man. I'm sorry, guys. You'd be in the Scaring program right now if it wasn't for us. What? Well, it is the gosh-darnedest thing. Hardscrabble's letting us into the Scare program. What? She was impressed with our performance in the games. She invited us to join next semester! Congratulations, guys! And that's not the only piece of good news. Sherrie and I are engaged! Oh. Who is Sherrie? She's my mom. Well, if it isn't my two favourite fellas! Come here. Give me some sugar. Oh! {BOTH CHUCKLING} Ugh! So uncomfortable. Oh, come on, Scott. I don't want you to think of me as your new dad. After all, we're fraternity brothers first. This is so weird. DON= Just think of me as your big brother that's marrying your mother. Wait. Hold on. We're brothers who share the same mom slash wife. That's worse. Well, I guess we should be going now. Promise me you'll keep in touch. You're the scariest bunch of monsters I have ever met. Don't let anyone tell you different. {ALL CHUCKLING} So, what now? You know, for the first time in my life, I don't really have a plan. You're the great Mike Wazowski. You'll come up with something. I think it's time I leave the greatness to other monsters. I'm okay just being okay. So long, Sull. So long. Wazowski! Whoa! Stop the bus! {BRAKES SCREECHING} Are you crazy? Mike, I don't know a single Scarer who can do what you do. I know, everyone sees us together, they think I'm the one running the show, but the truth is, I've been riding your coattails since day one! You made the deal with Hardscrabble. You took a hopeless team and made them champions. All I did was catch a pig! Technically, I caught the pig. Exactly! And you think you're just okay? You pulled off the biggest Scare this school has ever seen! That wasn't me! That was you! You think I could have done that without you? I didn't even bring a pencil on the first day of school. Mike, you're not scary. Not even a little. But you are fearless. And if Hardscrabble can't see that, then she can just... I can just what? Careful, Mr. Sullivan. I was just warming up to you. Sorry. Well, gentlemen, it seems you made the front page again. The two of you did something together that no one has ever done before. You surprised me. Perhaps I should keep an eye out for more surprises like you in my program. But as far as the two of you are concerned there is nothing I can do for you now. Except, perhaps, wish you luck. And, Mr. Wazowski, keep surprising people. You know, there is still one way we can work at a Scare company. They're always hiring in the mailroom. This is better than I ever imagined! I bet we break the all-time record in our first year. Mike, we're mail guys. I know. I'm talking about the record for letters delivered! All right, newbie's, quit goofing around. I'll have you know tampering with the mail is a crime punishable by banishment! Yes, sir. We're right on it, Mr. Snowman. The team of Wazowski and Sullivan are going to change the world starting today! Say scream! Scream! Scream! {UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING} Wazowski, good luck on your first day! Thanks, Merv. Good luck, Mike! {ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY} You coming, Coach? You better believe it. {MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING} {UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING} {PANTING RAPIDLY} {SIGHING LOUDLY} I made it! My first day of class! Uh, the school year's over, son. You missed it. Great. {INHALES DEEPLY} {PANTING RAPIDLY} Hi, I'm Dan Scanlon, the director of Monsters U and one of the film's writers. And I'm Kori Rae, the producer. And I'm Kelsey Mann, story supervisor. SCANLON: This is Pixar's first prequel. We loved the story of Mike and Sulley from the first film, and we really wanted to do something that explored the relationship more. And so, early on, we met and talked about the possibilities of a film. And I think it was Andrew Stanton that really said, "We should go before. "We should go back and see how these guys met." And I think, I wasn't around for the first film, but I think that there were... Somebody said they did some storyboard stuff where they explored, at least mentioned college. RAE: Right. I think that is true. MANN: Oh, yeah. RAE: When they were trying to figure out the backstories. SCANLON: Yeah, it seemed to me it was called Scare U or something. RAE: I think you're right. Yeah. SCANLON: So we felt like, "Wow, there is a lot of possibilities there." MANN: Yeah, and so much of college is finding out who you are, and that's what this film's all about, is finding out who these characters are and why they became the best friends we know. SCANLON: Yep, absolutely. And so that brings up a good point, which is we loved that idea, and then we quickly realized, in watching the first movie, that there's a line in the first film where they say... Mike, I believe, says to Sulley, "You've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade." And there's even more than that in the teaser. There's talk about fifth grade and a big... MANN: Yeah, Suzy Boils and all that. Yeah. SCANLON: Exactly. SCANLON: So we really thought about that and thought, "Well, maybe there's a way to suggest "in this early part of the film when Mike's young that Sulley is young, too." And that maybe they did meet young. We wanted to... MANN: Show that meeting, yeah, when they're literally in the third grade. SCANLON: And you and the team storyboarded so many versions of that idea. Having Mike and Sulley meet. And though it was entertaining, and though it was true to the chronological background of the movie, in the end, we realized that it was feeling a little bit like we weren't delivering on the promise of Mike and Sulley meeting. Mike and Sulley were meeting in the prologue, and then they were meeting again at college. It felt like you either had to make a movie called Monsters Elementary, where it's all about these kids getting to know each other in grade school, or lose it. And that would have been a very different movie. And we wanted this to be a very mature relationship and about dealing with their emotions and about self-discovery. And it just felt like it had to be more adult. It had to be in college. RAE: Right. And I think even one version was we didn't even have either of them as young, right, -in one version of the film? -SCANLON: Possibly. Yeah. I think there was one where we left it out completely. RAE: And then we put young Mike back in. SCANLON: For me, I feel like even though it would be great to have that perfect lineup, the intention is still the same. These guys knew each other a long time. And Pete Docter and John Lasseter were really great about saying, "You have to do what makes this story great. "And what tells the story best, and don't worry about that." So take that, Internet! I don't want to hear about it anymore. (ALL LAUGHING) SCANLON: We are aware of it. All right. So, that led us to the beginning of the movie. The beginning of the movie took a long time, as I think most beginnings of films do. We want to get it just right. You really have to set up the character. And so there was a lot of work done on just figuring out the best way to sell the idea of how much scaring means to Mike, how much his dream means to him, and how much it means to him to want to belong. I think that's what Mike wants more than anything is to fit in, in a world of monsters. And he decides that scaring must be the thing to make that happen. And so there were several versions boarded of this. -Several versions... -MANN: We did a lot of versions. They were not only here at the Scare Floor, but also at the Scare museum. SCANLON: And what was that? That was Mike... I'm trying to remember what that was, the Scare museum. MANN: That was meeting Mike and we wanted to establish Mike's passion for scaring. In the past museum versions, too, we met Mike and he was already loving scaring. He was already knee-deep in it, -knew everything about it. -RAE: Right. MANN: This was one of the first versions where we actually saw the birth of this dream. And so, I remember we did it where he was at a field trip, much like this, only it was at a Scare museum. We thought that would be an interesting location to see the history and past. RAE: Right. SCANLON: And he saw paintings of Scarers very similar to what happens in the party sequence in the movie. MANN: Yeah, later in the film, yeah. SCANLON: And it was really, I think, I remember, I think James Robertson really said, "I think he needs to see living Scarers." And we weren't sure about going to MI because we wanted to save it for that scene where they all go on a field trip. But James really pitched the idea and said, "He should look through a peephole in the door and see a Scare happening." And so we all embraced that. And then we took it further and said, "No, he should go in the room and see it for real." And so it really brought the whole thing to life. And really made us fall in of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away. What the fuck can I say to that? I don't know what to say to that. I don'twant to do this... Sit here. I can see the thing, you know. It's getting there, that's the cocksucker. I see that pen. I see it. I know it's there. I reach for it. No, no goddamn use. I have a son, you know. You do? Where is he? I don't know. I mean... he's around. He's here in town, but I don't know. You know... He's a tough one. Very. Got a girlfriend, Phil? - Get a girlfriend. - I'm trying. Do good things with her. Share the things. All that bullshit is true. Find a good one, hold on, and all that. Where's Linda? She went out to run some errands. She'll be back. She's a good girl. She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl, I think. She's a little daffy. She loves you. Well, maybe. Yeah. She's a good one. When's the last time you talked to your son? I don't know. Ten. Maybe ten... five. Fuck. Fuck. It's anotherthing that goes. Your memory? Time lines, you know? I can rememberthings, but not right there. You know? The fuck you know. I've seen it before. Otherfucking assholes like me? - There's no asshole like you. - Cocksucker. How come every word you use... is "cocksucker," "shit-balls," or "fuck"? - Do me a personalfavour. - Go fuck myself. You got it. God. I can't... I can't hold on to this any longer. Want another morphine pill? No. Give me the fucking phone. Who you gonna call? I want to see this. Where is he? - Who? - Jack. Is Jack your son? Do you want to call him on the phone? I can dial the number if you can remember it. It's not him. It's not him. He's afucking asshole. Phil, come here. This is so boring. So goddamn... That dying wish... and all that old-man-on-a-bed... wants one thing... Find him on a... Frank. His name's Frank Mackey. Frank Mackey? That's your son? Not my name. Go find... Find Lily. Give me that. Give me. Give me... If you give me that... overthere on... Fuck. I can't hold on to this. I got it. Respect the cock. And tame the cunt! Tame it! Take it on headfirst with the skills... that I will teach you atwork and say no! You will not control me! No! You will not take my soul! No! You will notwin this game! Because it's a game, guys. You want to think it's not? Go back to the schoolyard... and you have that crush on big-titted Mary Jane. Respect the cock. You are embedding this thought. I am the one who's in charge. I am the one who says yes! No! Now! Here! Because it's universal, man. It is evolutional. It is anthropological. It is biological. It is animal. We... are... men! You Gwenovier? I'm Captain Muffy, Frank's personal assistant. This is Doc. We can go in right down here. He started about thirty-five minutes ago... but he's probably getting all pumped up right now. Look down at the top of the page. What does it say? Get a calendar! That's right. I cannot stress this enough. It's a simple item. It's 99 cents at the store. But if you look into your packs, reach deep... you'll see I have been nice enough to include one. That's just the kind of prick I am. You need this calendar. It doesn't seem like much. It's a simple, small item... but it is going to make all the difference in yourworld. You meet a girl, you work an A-3 interruption. Say, an eight-day waiting period before next contact. How are you going to know when those eight days are up? That's right. You mark that calendar. You're going to stick with me and this calendar... and you're going to set goals. If you really want to make thatfriend something else... you have to be tough on yourself. You have to set goals. You, sir, in the brown short-sleeve shirt. I can't read your name tag. What's your name? Hi, is Frank there? No, you have the wrong number. I'm sorry. I'm lookingfor a Frank Mackey. There's no Frank here. Is this 818-775-3993? Yeah, but you have the wrong number. Do you know a Jack, by any chance? Just a regular deal. Loosers and tighters. - We're all set upstairs. - Thanks. She called me up and asked me for advice about a guy. - Got everything you need? - All set. Does she know how youfeel about her? Yes. Absolutely. And what did she say? She says she doesn't feel thatway about me. I don't think there's anyone in this room... that doesn't understand that kind of pain, Geoff... and I want to thank you for sharing that. Let me tell you what we're going to teach Denise... when we put our calendars to work and set goals. What I say is, "Denise..." "Denise the Piece." I mark it down. I write it up. And you have been warned. Because I have my lasers... I have my Tasers, I have my ICBMs... I have my bazookas, my jets pointed right at you. Because me and my brothers, we like to celebrate. And on the first of May, we celebrate V-Day. And come June, baby, it is the lick of my spoon. Come August, we like to celebrate... Saint Suck My Big Fat Fucking Sausage! I set goals for myself... and when I say I do not want to take it anymore... I will not take it anymore. You think she's yourfriend, Geoff? They're not yourfriends. Do you really think she'll be there when things go bad? When things go wrong, think they'll be there for us? You think again. Fucking Denise, Denise the Piece... you're gonna give me that cherry pie, sweet mama baby. Yeah, but listen up, that is not to say... thatwe don't all need females just as friends... because we'll learn later in Chapter Twenty-three... having a couple of chick friends... comes in real handy in setting jealousy traps. We'll get to that later. Right now, pull out your blue booklets, page 18. We're going quickly, butwe'll workshop it later. Eighteen, blue booklet. This is simple and clean, and if done correctly... can be very effective in getting some bush. Here we go. Call your so-calledfriend and set a date. Make it around 7.30. Call her on the phone. Hi.

Check that ego Come off it, I'm the prophet The professor, I'm-a teach you about the Worm Who eventually turned to catch wreck With the neck of a long-time oppressor And he's runningfrom the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringing pain in When the sunshine don'twork, the good Lord bring the rain in Now, that shitwill help you solve the case. Whateverthat meant. I'm sure it's real helpful, Ice-T. Did you listen to me? I was listening to you. I told you who did it, and you're not even listening. I'm through playing games. Be cool. Stay in school. Get out of the street now. Move it. - Come on, let's go. - You're late, not me. - You could have been in front. - I didn't see you. Why didn't you just... You could've come in the front. Hurry up. All right, you ready to keep winning? Sure. You OK? Almost busted my ankle there. Have that makeup lady fix your hair. It's really wet.

Do you know anybody involved with that Alan Thicke thing? The Corey Haim terrorist in the high school? Where's Richard and Julia? They're here. They're fine. They're in the dressing room, so we're all set. - See you later. - Go to it, handsome. - See you. - OK, buddy, love you. - Good luck, Rick. - Hey, Peter. Dick. I'm sorry. Dick. Fuck. Can't get thatfucking name. Who's ready to beat the record? Thatwas close. It's cats andfucking dogs out there. Cats and dogs indeed. I've never seen it rain this bad since last year. Because of La Niña or El Niño orwhateverthe shit. No bueno El Niño. Sorry I'm late. - Whatwas your name again? - Amy, Mr. Jennings. Call me D.J. Listen. Trust me. Stay focused. Where's the news department at the studio? - It's upstairs. - Have you ever been there? Sure. Why? I was wondering about the weather department. If they have outside meteorological services... or if they have in-house instruments. I can check on thatfor you, and laterwe can take a tour. Sounds good? You asking because it's raining outside? I guess. Whatever's happening, that's what you look into? I don't know. You don't know? It's not a bad way to be. Interested in everything that's going around. Wet is wet. Just that simple. - Hi, Mary. - Hi, hon, Stanley. Rose is on the phone. Here are today's cards. Fifteen minutes to go over those cards. - Sorry. - Find Paulafor me. Now? We're on the air in twenty minutes. Fucking hell, Mary. Yeah? Hi. - Hi, how you doing? - I'm drinking. - Slowly or quickly? - As fast as I can. You come home soon afterthe show. I went to see her. Some asshole answers the door in his underwear. He's fifty years old. There's coke and shit laid out on the table. Did she talk to you? She wentfucking crazy, Rose. - Did you tell her? - I don't know. I gotta go. I don't have time. Got a lot more drinking to do. - I love you. - I love you, too. Shit. Fuck. Police! Open the door! Who is it? LAPD! Open the door! I'm coming! I have to get dressed! You're not comingfast enough! Open the door! Didn't you hear me? I said I'm coming, and that means I'm coming! I just have to get dressed, all right? I have to get dressed! I hate coming here and not being able to talk. It's fine. I understand. I wish the circumstance was better. I don't know what's going to happen. Lfeel so overthe top with everything. Running out of your medication at all... let alone at a time like this, could be drastic. Thank you, Dr. Diane. Stanley Spector and his brilliantfriends... Richard and Julia can defeat today's adult challengers... Mim, Luis, and Todd. They're moving towards a half million dollarteam total... and a "What Do Kids Know?" record! Pink Dot. Hi. I'd like to get an orderfor delivery. - Phone number? - 818-725-4424. Partridge? Whatwould you like? I'd like to get an order of peanut butter... cigarettes, Camel Lights, water... Bottled water? No. You know what, forget the water. Just give me a loaf of bread. White bread. And do you have "Playboy" magazine? One of those. And "Penthouse," the magazine? You have that? One of those. And "Hustler"? Do you have that? - Yeah, I said. That it? - That's it. Still want the peanut butter, bread, and cigarettes? Yeah. What? The total is 31.90. Thirty minutes or less. Thank you. - Cash or credit card? - Cash. - Thanks. - Thank you. Respect the cock and tame the cunt! Have a great lunch! This is Gwenovier from the show "Profiles." She's here forthe interview. - It's nice to meet you. - I admire yourwork. Thank you. I have us set up... It's not very safe for you here. Lfinish one of these seminars, Gwenovier... I swearto fucking God, I am Batman. I'm Superman. I'm like afucking action hero, the way lfeel afterthat. I could walk outta this room right now, Gwenovier... go down the hall, walk down the street... and I could pick up any sweet little honey... that has even one second to stop. - One second? - Just one second, girl. One glance, one hesitation... one subtle look my way for me to know... and then it is bing, bang, boom. Oh, my God! I'm away on a tangent. I tell you... Don't hurt yourself, OK? I tell you, I do. I get so fucking jazzed at these seminars... because I am what I believe. I do as I say. I live by these rules... as religiously as I preach them. That's why I am getting the nasty... left, right, centre, up, down, sideways. The Battle of the Bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey. We'll start rolling now. What? I thoughtwe were rolling. Come on, go, go, go, Gwenovier. I am firing pearls at you here. I want you to know that I'm not succeeding in the bush... because I'm Frank T.J. Mackey. You think about this. There are women... who want to destroy me. No. Lfind that hard to believe. It makes it very difficult, twice as hardfor me. There's some little hottie I'm moving in on... knows me, knows my plans and my schemes, you know? She'll want to fuck with me. She'll go back, tell herfriends. "Frank T.J. Mackey, he ain't all that. "He ain't all that. Didn't get me." So, me, I am... I'm just on full afterburners... full throttle through hottie heaven. - Just dodging left... - Yes, I understand. These bullets from these terrorists. Babe, beauties. Calm down, take it easy, and be a good boy... OK, Mr. Mackey? Thank you. You sit back there... put your microphone on for me, please. So we can do this thing, all right? Yes, ma'am. Let me start by asking you... Just one second. You missed a button. Thank you. What do you want to know? Make it happen. This is you, Donnie. Go, go, go! Hello. You're back again, huh? Yes. Hi. How are you? - What can I get you? - A Diet Coke. You look tired. Want one of these? Better pour you one of these, huh? Can you ring me up? - Brad, good to see you. - It's good to see you. You make that down payment on that Harley yet? Not yet. I'll make it nextweek. You ever get out of here? Six days a week. You'll be the first to go. I would love that. - Want another one? - Yes, please. I'd like a tequila. - What kind? - It doesn't matter. Open up the door now! Yes, hi! Hello! I'm sorry. I had to get dressed. You the resident here? You alone in there? There's no one else in there with you? What's wrong? First of all, turn down the music... so we can have a conversation. You mind if I come in? No. Go ahead. You got your neighbours real worriedfor you. Sorry. You live alone? - What's your name? - Claudia. - Claudia what? - Wilson. Claudia Wilson... are you trying to go deaf? What? Did you hearwhat I just said? Yes, but I don't know what... You're listening to your music so loud... you're going to damage your ears. You continue to listen to your music at that level... then you're going to damage not only your ears... but your neighbours' ears as well. I didn't realize itwas that loud. That right there is the first sign of hearing loss. I see you got your TV on there, too. You usually keep that on at the same time? I don't know. What is this? You been doing some drugs today, Claudia? Have you been doing some drinking? I got a call of a disturbance here. Some loud music..."A"... Some screaming and yelling. Has there been some screaming and yelling here? I had someone come to my door. Someone that I didn't want to hear. And I told them to leave, so it's no big deal. They left. I'm sorry. Was that your boyfriend? You don't have a boyfriend? Well, who was it? I was... He's gone. I mean, it's not... It's over, you know? Mind if I have a look around for your safety? It's fine. What are you lookingfor? Claudia, why don't you let me handle the questions... and you handle the answers? I'm here to help you. Do you still have to do homework? Not as much as I used to. Since we started, I haven't gone to school much. I've had so many auditions. I don't have regular classes anymore. What do you do? They let me have my own study time... my own reading time in the library. That's pretty cool. Do you have an agent, Stanley? You should get one. I'm serious. You could get a lot of stuff outta this. Like what? Like endorsements and shit! Bite it, Cynthia. You can getfree stuff... from people who want you to endorse their product. Commercials, a sitcom, an M.O.W. Or something. What's M.O.W.? Hello! Movie of the week. I wentfor one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim. Was it a call-back? No. But I'll probably get a call-back. If we beat the record, you might get a call-back. I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard. - Saucy, saucy! - Guys, settle down. - Cynthia? - What? - I gotta go to the bathroom. - Can you hold it? Yes siree! Thatwas absolutely fantastic, and I thank you very much. As a matter of fact... we may take youfolks on the road with us... That's my thing. I'm serious. Milk and sports, man. You never heard milk and sports? Anything baseball or dealing with numbers... when it comes to those orwho broke whatever record. Any kind of dairy product or dairy recipe. Like goat milk, goat cheese, all that stuff. Check this out over here. So, guys, justwork with me on that. Excuse me, can you bring me low fat milk, please? A couple of ice cubes. They don't look so tough. Do they look smart? What are they going to do, beat us? Maybe. We're not going out two days before we set the record. They want us done, they'll call in the Harvard SWATteam. Ready to run. - You smell like trouble. - I'm fucking hammered. You OK? Good. You have a chance to look those over? It's the same fucking shit forthirty years, Burt. You look like you have money in your pocket. Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend Brad there. Just throw some money around. Money, money, money. This sounds threatening. Do you have love in your heart? I have love all over. I even have love for you, friend. Is it real love? The kind of love that makes youfeel... that intangible joy in the pit of your stomach... like a bucket of acid and nerves running around... making you hurt and happy and all over... You're head over heels? You lost me with the last couple of cocktail words... but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me. I have love. A very chatty kind. Indeed you do. No, I mean I'm telling you. I have love. Yes, and I'm listening avidly, fella. My name is Donnie Smith, and I have lots of love to give. Lot of stuff here, huh? It's thirty seconds. Got my eye on you. I'll be back. What the fuck's going on overthere? I gotta go to the bathroom. Jesus Christ, Stanley! No, you cannot do that. Let me explain something to you people. You have to tone it. Don't be real aggressive. You have to be subtly abusive so they don't know it. "No, you're not going outside and play with yourfriends... "until that entire room is cleanedfloorto ceiling." Julia's room's the same way. Like a pigsty. But it's outfits now. You should have seen what she had on walking out the door! I said, "We're going to school, not afashion show." It's not afashion show. It's school, for goodness sake! Let's make some fucking money here, people. You with me, Jimmy? The book says, "We may be through with the past... "but the past ain't through with us." "We met upon the level, and we're parting on the square." In my fucking sleep, Burt. Andfive, four, three, two... Live, from Burbank, California... it's "What Do Kids Know?" Going into our thirty-third year on the air... it's America's longest-running quiz show... and the place where three kids get to challenge three adults... and in the end, we'll see who's the boss. Moving towards their eighth consecutive week as champions... we have the kids... Richard, Julia, and Stanley! And our new adult challengers are Mim, Luis, and Todd. And me, I'm Dick Jennings... and say hello to yourfavourite host and my boss... Jimmy Gator! Back again, again, again! I'm Jimmy Gator, and believe it or not... we are at the end of week seven, heading towards week eight... with these three incredible kids who... hello, hello... are just two days and two games away... from the "What Do Kids Know?" record... forthe longest-running quiz show in television history. Now, we are endorsed by the PTA... and the North American Teacher's Foundation. We do try to keep our standards high... and that's why we are the longest-running quiz show... in television history! I want to say something about these kids. These kids right here, they'll be here a while. But today's a dangerous day because... I have just metwith the adult challengers backstage... and let me tell you... they are a terrific challenge for our kids. So let's get this show up and away, shall we? We want to know where your son is, Marcie. Jerome Samuel Hall. Did he fightwith your husband? Is this the Worm? Maybe they had afight. Maybe itwas an accident. Do they call him Worm? We want to know where your son is, Marcie. Do they call him Worm? Help us help your son, Marcie. Do they call him Worm? Help us help your son, Marcie. Your son and your grandson. Help us help them. Is this the Worm? Let's jump right in. A quick recap forthose who don't know. Round One. Three categories. Steals are OK. Point scale escalating from 25 to 250... one of which is a conversation bonus. That'll be 31.90. The categories are... "Authors, Chaos Versus Superstring... "and Rub-a-Dub." Max. Thanks. Adults won a coin toss backstage... so they get to pick first. Team captain... Mim. Got it. First question fortwenty-five. This female author's mostfamous work..."O Pioneers!" Willa Cather. Willa Catherfortwenty-five. Best known forthe Tragedy and Blood genre, this playwright... Thomas Kyd. This French playwright and actor joined the Béjart troupe... MolÈire. I'm afraid I'm going to need afull name, Stanley. Jean-Batiste Poquelin MolÈire. What the fuck is this? God damn. My little fucker. I have no idea where he gets this shit. He's afucking genius, really. This is Chad. Can I have your phone number? Hello. Great. This is "Seduce and Destroy"? Yes, it is. Can I have your home phone number? I don'twant to order anything. I have a situation that's just come up... that's really pretty serious... and I don't know who to talk to orwhat I should do... but maybe you could put me in touch with somebody... if I explain myself? We're really only equipped to take orders here, sir. It's just us with the phones, and that's whatwe do. Could you connect me with somebody else, you think? What's the situation? OK, great. Let me try to explain myself without it seeming crazy. But here I go. My name is Phil Parma... and I work for a man named Earl Partridge... Mr. Earl Partridge. I'm his nurse. He's a very sick man. He's a dying man, and he's sick... and he's asked me to help him... to help him find his son. Hello? Are you there? I'm here. I'm listening. OK. You see... Frank T.J. Mackey is Earl Partridge's son. So where are you from originally? - Around here. - Valley? - Hollywood, mainly. - What did your parents do? My fatherwas in television. My mother... This is going to sound silly to you. - Try me. - She was a librarian. Why does that sound silly? I don't know. I guess it doesn't. Does your mother still work? No, she's retired. Are you close? She's my mother. Yes, but she's a woman, too. How does she feel about "Seduce and Destroy"? What does she say? Well, she says, "You go get them, honey." What about yourfather? My father. Unfortunately, he passed away. I'm sorry. I had no idea. No, please. I wouldn't have brought that up if I had known. It's a very hard thing. Please. Yes, it is, but... listen. You have to move forward. The past has its place. Itwas a long time ago and people die. Let's switch gears here. According to your book, you ended up at UC Berkeley? - '84-'89. - Psychology major. - That's right. - Get your masters? This close. That's impressive in five years. Cap, can I have some coffee? Can I get you anything? No, I'm good. She's good. I need coffee. Cats and dogs out there, huh? Must have a lot going on for all that stuff back there. You could... You could have quite a party with all that stuff. You been on Prozac long? Dexedrine? I don't... Interesting drugs. Dexedrine's basically speed in a pill, you know? But I guess a lot of the doctors... are balancing out the Prozac with the Dexedrine. That liquid morphine will knock you down... out, around, up and down, someone's not careful. You can't mix those up. Strong stuff here, boy. What exactly you have wrong, you need all this stuff? - Motherfucker! - What? What are you talking about? Youfucking asshole! Who the fuck do you think you are? I come in here... you don't know who I am, what my life is... and you have the balls, the indecency... to ask me a question about my life? Please, lady, why don't you just calm down? Fuck you, too! Don't you call me lady! I come in here, I give these things to you... you check, you make your phone calls... look suspicious, ask questions! I'm sick! I have sickness all around me, and you ask me my life? What's wrong? Have you seen death in your bed? In your house? Where's yourfucking decency? And then I'm asked fucking questions. What's... wrong? ! You suck my dick! That's what's wrong! And youfucking call me lady? ! Shame on you! Shame on both of you! So why don't they have the same last name? Because they don't have the same last name. I know, and I can't really explain that. But I have afeeling there is a situation between them... like they don't know each other much orwell. Something like they don't talk much any more, even. God, does this sound weird? I just don't understand why you're calling me. There's no numberfor Frank in any of Earl's stuff... and he's pretty out of it. Like I said, he's dying... dying of cancer. So... - What kind of cancer? - Brain and lung. - My mother had breast cancer. - I'm sorry. - Is she all right? - She's fine now. - That's good. - Itwas scary, though. - It's a hell of a disease. - It sure is. Wait, I'm sorry. So why call me? I know this sounds silly, and I might sound ridiculous... like this is the scene of the movie... where the guy tries to get ahold of the long-Iost son... but this is that scene. And I think they have those scenes in movies... because they're true. Because they really happen... and you gotta believe me, this is really happening. I can give you my number and you can go check... with whoever you gotta check with and call me back... but do not leave me hanging on this. All right? Please. I'm just... Please. See... this is the scene of the movie where you help me out. You're great. These are great questions. Good. I thought you grew up in the Valley. Like I said... around. You went to Van Nuys High? I wouldn't say I went. Lfrequented. I was misguided, pathetic. Definitely not the Frank T.J. Mackey... you're so eagerly wanting to put on national television. Because I was swimming in whatwas... as opposed to what I wanted. - Where does that name come from? - My name? It's not your given name? It's my mother's name, actually. That's good. Done your research. - And Frank? - My mother's father. That's why. See, I had some trouble... Iocating your school records at UCLA and Berkeley. It's your name change... because they had no official enrolmentfor you. No, they wouldn't. No. Because I was never officially enrolled there. - Was that unclear? - Kind of. God, I wouldn'twant that to be misunderstood. My enrolment was totally unofficial. Sadly, I couldn't afford to pay the tuition up there. But there were three wonderful professors... kind enough to let me to sit in their classes. Macready, Horn, and Langtree, among others. You're welcome to call them if you like. I didn't get afree ride. So whatwe're looking at here is a true rags-to-riches story. That's why people respond so strongly to "Seduce." Because at the end of the day... "Seduce" may not be just about picking up chicks... and sticking your cock in. It's aboutfinding out what you can be in this world... defining it, controlling it, and saying... "I will take what is mine." And you just happen to get a little blow job out of it... then, hey, what the fuck? There you go. End of Round One. Excellentwork. I think we should take a look at the scores here. Kids are up a leg with 1,500... and the adults are down a little bitwith 1025. So we'll be back for Round Two in a ring-dang-doo! Hello, hello! Bonus musical question. And the winner is... Kids! Kids are in the lead. They get a chance to pull further andfarther ahead... if they answerthe following secret bonus musical question. Now what I'm going to do is read a line from an opera. I want you to give me that line back... in the language in which the opera was originally written. Andfor a bonus 250... 250... you can sing it! Here's the line. "Love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame. "And it's all in vain to call it... "if it chooses to refuse." Well, thatwas in French... and thatwas from the opera "Carmen..." and that goes... L'amour est un oiseau rebelle Que nul ne peut apprivoiser Et c'est bien en vain qu'on I'appelle S'il lui convient de refuser See you got some coffee brewing here. Yeah, it's not... It's been on for a bit. I like iced coffee, generally... but a day like today, with the rain and whatnot... I enjoy a warm cup. Do you want a cup? Is that all right? It's raining cats and dogs out there. I'd just as soon not go back in it. I don't know how fresh it's going to be. I'm sure it's fine, Claudia. Do you take cream or sugar? That'd be fine. So, Claudia, let me just say... so I can get my role as an LAPD officer... out of the way here before we enjoy our coffee. I don't like to talk shop over coffee. I'm not going to write you up. I'm not going to give you a citation here... but the real problem is that you got people around you... people who work from home, trying to getwork done. And if you're listening to your music that loud... they're inconvenienced by that. If you had a job, you'd probably understand... but you like listening to your music. That's fine. Justwant to keep an eye on the volume level. Maybe memorize what number you see on the dial. If it's the middle of the day, that's what I do. I just set it at two and a half... and then I know that's a good listening levelfor me. But you like listening to your music loud. That's fine. That's cool. It's good to rock out sometimes. But you can't do it every day... or else you risk damaging your ears. Seriously. You listen to it all the time like that? You're going to drive these people crazy. Anyway, you get the point. Cheers. So this boyfriend bothering you? I don't have a boyfriend. The gentleman who was at the door... He's not my boyfriend. A lot of times, in domestic abuse situations... the young woman is afraid to speak out. You don't have to be afraid to tell me anything. And as a police officer, I can tell you... it goes bad places. Young woman's afraid to speak out... next thing you know, I'm here on a 187. What's a 187? It's not good. And it's where situations like this always lead. It's not my boyfriend, and it's not anything. It's over. Really. He won't come back. I don'twant to have to come back here... You won't have to! I wouldn't mind coming back. You know, get a look at your pretty face again. I'll be right back. Here you go. Let's get the jacket off. It'll help you to breathe. I can'tfucking do this. I've... I... I think I'm gonna throw up. I think. I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old. - What's the problem? - I need to go to the bathroom. Jesus Christ, Stanley. You can't go now. You have exactly one minute before we're on the air. Now is not the time to go to the bathroom! Why does this fucking shit always happen, Stanley? Excuse me, is there a problem? Mind your own business! You watch your mouth, young man! Why don't you mind your own business? Oh, no, she didn't! Waitforthe commercial break, then you can go. Just hold it. Don't taunt the kids. - I'm trying to be helpful. - Don't start trouble. You haven't seen trouble! Wait till next commercial break. - What's the problem? - Nothing. Lily! Please! Get away from me, you shithead! Watch out, watch out. Don't eat these. Here you go. Out of the trash! Phil, are you there? It's Chad. I'm going to put you in touch with Janet, Frank's assistant. And she'll see what she can do, all right? Thank you, and good luck to you and your mother. Thanks, man. You, too. Janet, are you there? All right, Janet, you have Phil Parma. I have cancer, Mary. I have about two months. I have no time. It's in my bones. I don't have a chance. I'm fucked. Andfifteen seconds. Ten seconds. Andfive, four, three, two... We're back, ready for Round Two! And we're talking to our adult contestants here today. Mim, it says here that you live in Chatsworth, California... and that you have two kids. That's right. I have a six-year-old... Do you know who I am? You're afriend of the family, I presume. What does that mean? Nothing special. Just a spoke in the wheel. You talk in rhymes and riddles and Rub-a-Dub. But that doesn't mean anything to me. See, I used to be smart. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from TV. It might have been before my time. I remember. In the Sixties, right? - I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. - Like you said. Smart kid! You got struck by lightning once. So what? - I heard about that. - Did it hurt? But you're all right now. So what's the what? - What? - That's right. I used to be smart. Now I'm just stupid. Brad, dear, who was it that said... "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself"? Itwas the lovely Samuel Johnson. Who also spoke of afellow "who was not only dull... "but a cause of dullness in others." "The cause of dullness in others." Picky, picky! Let me tell you this. Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on... and taken from him and his money stolen! Who took his life and his money? His parents? His mommy and daddy? Make him live this life like this... A man of genius who gets shit on as a child... and that scars! That hurts! Have you ever been hit by lightning? It hurts. It doesn't happen to everyone. It's an electrical charge. Itfinds its way across the universe... and it lands in your body and your head! And as for ruined but by himself... not if his parents took his freaking life... and his money and tell you to do this... and to do that, and if you don't... Your parents took your money you won on that game show? Yes! They did. What does that mean, a spoke in the wheel? Things go round and round, don't they? Yes, they do. They do. But I'll make my dreams come true. Sounds sad as a weeping willow. I used to be smart. But now I'm just stupid. Shall we drink to that? I want to talk a little bit more about your background. You made some references earlier... to subjective human experiences and terrible things... Actually, I'm confused about your past. Is that still lingering? It's so boring. Justwant to clear some things up. Excuse me. Thank you, Muff. It's afunny thing that... This is an important element of "Seduce and Destroy..." facing the past is an important way of not making progress. This is something I tell my men over and over and over. This isn't meant... I try to teach my students to ask... "What is it in aid of?" Are you asking me that? Well, in trying to figure outwho you are... In aid of what? Frank, I'm saying that in trying to figure out... I have more important things to put myself into. I think this is something important... you might need to think about putting yourself into. Not really. It's not like I'm trying to attack you here. This is how you want to spend yourtime, go, go, go. But you'll be surprised atwhat a waste it is. The most useless thing in the world... is thatwhich is behind me. Chapter Three. We talked earlier about your mother... and about yourfather and his death. I don'twant to be challenging, but I have to ask. I justwant to clarify something that I understand... I'm not sure I hear a question in here. I'm trying to put this as delicately as I can. What's the question? Do you remember Miss Simms? I know a lot of women. I'm sure she remembers me. From when you were a boy. She lived in Tarzana. That's my old stomping ground. Is this the attack portion of the interview? Is the girl coming in forthe kill? No. This is about getting something right... and clarifying your answers to an earlier question. What question? I was told that your mother died, Frank. That's what you heard. Do you remember Miss Simms? I talked to Miss Simms, your neighbour and caretaker... after your mother died in 1980. And in my research... I have you as the only son of Earl and Lily Partridge. And what I learned from Barbara Simms... is that your mother, Lily, died in 1980. So, it's my understanding that information supplied... by you and your company and the answers... to the questions I've asked is incorrect, Frank. And if I want to get to the bottom... of who you are and why you are... then I think that yourfamily history... your actualfamily history... Well, this is important. What is yourfucking question? Well, I guess my question's this... Why would you lie, Frank? Kids... adults... I would like you to put yourself at a picnic. Place yourself there with yourfamily andfriends... if you'd like. You'll hearthree musical notes, and you are to tell me... what it might represent that you wouldfind at a picnic. The first three notes. Guys. Yes, Todd. Well, Jimmy, I know this. I have perfect pitch, and thatwould be A-D-E... and thatwould represent lemonade. For 250. Next notes, please. Got it. That's E-G-G, which would be egg. For 500. And the third set of notes. Guys? You don'twant any water? No. I just... I'm so fucked up right now, Alan. There's just so much, so many things. Are you on drugs right now? If I tell you something, you're a lawyer, right? You can't say anything, tell anybody. It's like a privilege. Attorney/Client. - You understand? - Not exactly. Like a shrink. If I go see a shrink, I'm protected. I can say things... Fuck! I don't know what I'm doing. Linda, you're safe. It's all right. You're my friend. You and Earl are clients. Whatever you want to say won't leave this room. You have something you want to say to me? I have to tell you something. I have something to tell you. I want to change his will. Can I change his will? I need to. No, you can't change his will. Only Earl can. No, you see, I never loved him. I never loved him. Earl. When I met him, lfucked him, and I married him... because I wanted his money. You understand? I'm telling you this... I've nevertold anyone, I didn't love him... but now, I know I'm in thatwill. We made thatfucking thing, and all the money I'll get. I don'twant it, because I love him so much now. I've fallen in love with him now for real as he's dying. I look at him, and he's about to go, Alan. He's moments... I took care of him through this. What now, then? Let's listen. Hello, Mary. How are you and the seven kids? As you probably heard by now... we sure gave that Pope a run for his money. Thatwould be Robert E. Lee. His wife was Mary Parke Custis. I know he had seven children. And he would be talking about Pope... who he defeated at the Battle of Manassas. Absolutely right, Miss Mim. Next question. Come on. Snap out of it, man. Come on, Stanley. Bonjour, Josephine. Maintenant je suis en Egypte. Yes, Mim. Thatwould be Napoleon speaking to Josephine. Absolutely right, for 500. Next voice. I don'twant him to die. I didn't love him when we met... and I did so many bad things to him that he doesn't know. Things that I want to confess to him... But now I do. I love him. Linda, what kind of medication are you on? This isn't any fucking medication talking! Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney. Can you go in the final moments and change the will? I don'twant any money. I couldn't live with myself with this thing that I've done. Lfucked around. Lfucking cheated on him. There. You're his lawyer, our lawyer. I am his wife. I broke the contract of marriage. Lfucked around on him many times. I sucked other men's cocks. Adultery is not against the law. You can't use it in court to discredit the will. - Linda, calm down. - I can't. You don't have to change the will. If you want nothing, renounce the will when the time comes. What does that mean? Where does the money go? It goes to the nearest relative. What's that? That's Frank? No. That can't happen. Earl doesn'twant him to have anything. That's whatwill happen. This is so fucked up I can hardly stand it. Linda, stop! Now, you take a moment, you breathe... and one thing at a time. - Shut the fuck up. - Want me to help you? - Shut the fuck up! - You need to sober up. Now, you must really shut the fuck up. Please, shut the fuck up. I have to go. - Let me call you a car. - Shut the fuck up! Now, imagine that you are attending a jam session... of classical composers... and they have each done an arrangement... of the classic favourite "Whispering." Now, we have here the New World Harmonica Trio... who are going to play... three variations on the theme... as three classical composers might have written it. So you are to name the first composer. Guys. Yes, Todd. That sounded like Brahms. A bit like his "Hungarian Dance Number Six." That is excellent, Todd. Next composer, guys. Stanley the man. I don't know the answer. That is not right. That's not right, Stanley. The correct answer is Ravel. Ravel. And now I'm gonna have ourthree whistlers... please to present the next musical... There were three musical sections here... and this'll be the third section that the whistlers... and they'll play a piece that's... It's very recognizable. Chopin, actually. And it's in the style of "Marche Militaire." It's a very recognizable piece. So if you please just listen to this... and I'm sure you can identify the... I'm sort of giving away the answer here. It's Chopin. I don't mean to give away the answer. It's just... please just... Well, sing us a ditty, guys. A Chopin ditty. Let's have a Chopin ditty here. I can't... Go to the fucking card. Go to the card. Go. Go to the card. I'm back. For not afresh cup, this is a good cup of coffee. Thank you. What do you want to talk about? I don't know. Do you want to talk? What's your name? Jim Kurring. - Call 911. - I think I had a stroke. No, no, no. I'm fine. I'm all right. I justwant to finish the show. No, we need to call an ambulance. Get yourfucking hands off me! Let this guy help you. I'll tell you what happened. Call 911. Do it right now, Mary. Lfell down. I couldn't see for a minute, but I'm OK. Get your hands off me! - Did you piss your pants? ! - Shut up! - What's going on? - Nothing! Go away! Don't tell me to go away, Stanley. I'm the co-ordinator, and you will answer me. Now, what is going on? - What's the problem? - Nothing. I'm fine. Why didn't you answer those questions? - I didn't know the answer. - Bullshit! You know the answer to every goddamn question. I knew the answers, and I'm not half as smart as you... so what the hell happened? He pissed his pants. You pissed your pants? No, I didn't. I'm fine. Stand up. - I said I'm fine. - Stand up. Jesus, Stanley, what the fuck did you do thatfor? I justwant to keep playing. I'm fine. That's great. You know that to a performer, that's food, right? That shows that you love him, and I'm sure he appreciates it. Everything's fine. Relax. Relax, darling. Everything's fine. I'm OK. All right, see? I'm all right. It's pretty fucking stupid, isn't it? Jesus Christ. What the fuck do they think out there? They must be laughing their asses off. Tell them I got a bad knee or some fucking thing. This is fuckingfunny. - What do you want to do? - Justwhat I said. Are we going to continue with this game? All right, you look at me! You are two days away from this record. Nobody's ever done that. You get through this, I'll get you anything you want. You just got to get through this. Now, hang in there, buddy. I'm sorry I squeezed your arm. I love you. - Are we doing this? - Fucking stupidity. Why don't I put the medic on? I need to go with him. Don't let him do this. He's been doing it forthirty years. You don't know how sick he really is. It's afucking game show, Mary. Hearthat? Does that hurt? - What is it? - It's in my ear. It's TMJ. It's what it's called. Technically. How about they just call it, "Clicking Jaw"? - Pain in the jaw, yeah. - How about that? Easierto remember. Yeah. It gets... I don't even know if I have it, actually. I'm sorry. 15-L-27, I'm currently Code Seven. I'm sorry. This is my job. 15-L-27, roger. We were just getting warmed up. Yeah. I gotta go. Well, if this joker shows up again... or you got your music up too loud... maybe we can have another cup of coffee. If you're not here for a 187. No. Do not joke about that. I seen too many of those. I'm sorry. It's all right. You were kidding. It's OK. All right. You keep your chin up and your music down, OK? Yes, I will. Itwas nice to meet you, OfficerJim. - JustJim. - Good. Bye-bye, Claudia. Yeah, what is it? Did youforget something? No, I'm... I was wondering... Man, lfeel like a bit of a scumbucket doing this... since I came here as an officer of the law... and the situation and everything... but lfeel like I'd be afool... if I didn't do something I really want to do... which is to ask youfor a date. You want to go on a date with me? Please, yes. - Well, is that illegal? - Sort of. Then I'd like to go. What do you want to do? I don't know. I hadn't thought about it. That's not true. I have thought about it. I've been thinking about it since you opened the door. Really? I thought you were flirting with me a little. You want to go tonight? I'm off tonight, yeah. - What time? - 8.00. - I don't get off until 10.00. - 10.00. Yeah. Fine. Yeah. Bye. Frank, I'm really not trying to attack you here. I think if you have something that needs to be cleared up... I was told that yourfather is Earl Partridge. I was told that he left you and your mother... and you took care of your mother during her illness... that you took care of herwhile she struggled with cancer... and that Miss Simms became your caretaker... when your mother finally passed away. Can you talk about your mother, Frank? No, no, not true. And you know what? Even if you don't get to pump her... you still need to practice your skills on afeminist. I will. You need to do that. This is Doc. Doc, it's Janet. I have to talk to Frank. He's in the interview, Janet. Interrupt him. Get him on the phone with me right away. What happened? Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone. Come on, Frank. What are you doing? What am I doing? I'm quietly judging you. Andfive, four, three, two... Oh, boy, what a day. What a round. Back and in for me and... and the final one-on-one round... to determine who's who today. Let's check the scores on the board, shall we? Well, the kids have an even 2,000... and the adults are way up with forty-seven. Now, that doesn't mean that this game... is out of reach forthe kids. Elders, who's the lucky so-and-so? It's me, Jimmy. Come on over, Mim. I don'twant to go. I can't do it this time. What the fuck are you talking about? You have to go, Stanley. You're the smartest. I don'twant to go. Why can't one of you do it? If you don'tfucking stand up and get overthere... I'll beat your ass. I'm sick of being the one, always has to do everything. I don'twant to be the one always. Kids, I don't even have to ask. Stanley, get your butt over here. I'm sick. I'm sick here now. I confuse melancholy with depression sometimes. You see? Why don't you run along now, friend? Your dessert is getting cold. - I'm sick. - Stay thatway. I'm sick, and I'm in love. You seem the sort of person who confuses the two. That's right! That's the first time you've been right. I confuse the two, and I don't care! I love you. I love you, and I'm sick. I'll talk to you tomorrow. I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow... for my teeth. I love you, Brad. Brad the bartender. If you want to love me back, I'll be good to you. I'll be goddamn goodfor you. I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answerwrong. that you'll never hurt me... like that... again. Never. Say it. I will never hurt you. Never. No matter what. I would rather die. How long have we know each other? Hmm? OK, Ben. Really? Thank you. Thank you... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I love you. That's OK. Heyyy! Wow! Welcome home. My goodness. So good to see you! How was it? Was it really great? Oh.. I'm so happy to see you. Lucy? You look exhausted... - Where's your cane? - Carl tossed it. I don't need it any more. - What? That is fantastic! - Who's Carl? Carl's my trainer. You know I'm really worried about her. - Oh, she is just tired. Honey, you OK? I'm fine... I'm fine... Where are we? Well... I know you're mad that I did this. And we don't have to live here, it's not definite, but... I thought you might want to see it. - Are you going to get the bags? - No, leave it, leave it. - Kurt! - Oh, he missed you terribly. We have to talk. - Who are all these people? - Mom, I told you... I know, I know, but it was too late to cancel the caterers. and I thought what a wonderful way to met you neighbors.... That's OK. Hi! Crowd: "Hi!" I'm Lucy. How are you all? Your mother has been telling us about all your adventures. Grace and Jonathan live right next door. I'm just so glad that somebody bought this terrific house. Gracie helped me with the guest list. They know everybody in town. - Now ask John about the country club. - Yeah, do you play golf? He would love that. And Lucy could swim or play tennis. Okay. Girl, you look so cute, my goodness we miss you. We really do. Oh, well... - Are you ever gonna come back? - What do you think? - Will you excuse me for a minute? - Thanks for inviting us! Hi. Hello. Want my drink? You can throw it in my face. That won't be necessary. That's strong, though. - Great house. - Thank you. You know, I really have you to thank for it. Because when we were together ...and you said that whole thing about about holding each other back. You know you were right. OK... No, really, because I have Ben, and this house, and... - You, are you partner yet? - No, not yet. - You didn't introduce us. - I would like to know who did. She grew up next door. She didn't need to be introduced. She was just there. Oh, stop it. - Well, where is Lucy? Let's met her. - Yeah, enough of the mystery. Oh... I saw her around here, somewhere. She's ah... Well, she's talking to somebody right now. So, how's Hawaii? Ah... uh... oh... uh... ah... Ben? Yeah... uh... No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just... uh? Honey? - Ben? What's wrong? - I don't know... I thought... I'm fine. I'm fine. Met our neighbors. These are our neighbors. This is Lucy. -Thank you so much! -You're welcome! Everything was delicious! Honey, I'm going to get going. Oh, Oh, don't wanna come in for a cup of coffee? No, no, no. I am so exhausted. I'm fine... Well, if you're so tired, maybe you should spend the night. Welcome home. That was fun. - Did you have fun? - Yeah. You scared me though... You almost fainted. Yeah? Yeah, I should get some sleep. Saw you talking to "Steve Mason". - Yeah, he was here... - He's an asshole. I am well aware of that. You're not jealous, are you, Ben? - It's just he's sooo... - Ben, shut up! If anyone's gonna be jealous here, it's gonna be me! OK? I saw you talking to that neighbor! In fact, get out of here! Go sleep on the coach! I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I love you so much. I know. - But you... (Blows on her neck) - Pppphhhttt! Ben! Oh... Uh.... Uh... Ah... "Our latest victim, Leslie Singer, is presumed dead... "at this point, missing for 3 months. The search goes on... Ben. "These are all the locations where the girls were taken... Oh, my God. "...by Det. Waylon... Oh, God. "3 girls missing from the Council Buffs area of Iowa. "All of them have blond hair. They are 5'6" to 5'8" and weigh 110 to 135 lbs." I decided it would be fun to dress up one of the rooms with Ben's... old toys and trophies from school. I would hate to see what it looks like down there! Ah... this is really not an opportune time. Thank you so much! It's gonna mean so much to him... - Oh, but I've been waiting for Carl. - Carl? - My trainer? - OK, go ahead, and I'll lock myself out. (Car honks horn) - "Lucy? - What, Ben? "I love you." Ben, why not just try meth while you're at it. Now you're showing me this? I was here three months ago, I asked if you knew her. - I don't think it was me. - No? I forgot about it. She never came back. I haven't... I'm gonna need your surveillance tapes. Copy of all your receipts. We'll get that. Come on, Chris. What can this be? Did you slip on a banana peel too? Door bell: "Ding Dong!" - Hello. - Hey! I'm sorry to bother you on a Sunday, Mr. Keller. I'm Det. Waylon, and I'm working on the Leslie Singer case. - What? - Leslie Singer. She's the... well you may not know. She's the young... Whoa, Kurt! - I'm sorry! Are you OK? - I'm Fine. - I know this bird. - Oh! We're gonna go for a ride, ladies. Won't that be fun? Sorry, but I had to dig you up before the new owners did. I'll come back for you guys. Well, tons of people bought lottery tickets that day. - I bet even Leslie bought one. - Why do you say that? Oh... Oh, well... Everybody wants to win the lottery, don't they? 36 million? You know what you should do? You should find all the people that bought lottery tickets that day... - And ask if they saw her. - That's a good idea. Except, I can't do that. People, for the most part, use cash to buy tickets. The only person I know who bought a ticket that day, was you. Why? Because you won. That's right. Well... I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. My card is on the picture there. I will. Ah, I gotta ask you something. What? What's it like? Oh... ah... Well... ah... You know how they say your life totally changes? Uh, huh. They're not lying. You're a lucky bastard. God speed! "I have 3 dead ladies, lying in my car... "My husband killed 3..." Ahhh... Hello? Yes? What? OK... OK. Will do, good bye! "My husband killed..." - Shannon, get Brentford out of the pool. - Oh no, that's OK. If I can wander around in my pajamas, your dog can swim in my pool. You can wander around in your pajamas any time. So Grace, what is it you do? - I'm a family planner. - I'm not sure what that is. - John, are you doing OK on that drink? - I'm fine, I must say. I mostly work with inner city families, single parents... - Shannon... Is she home from college? - Northwestern. Oh... great! That's really great. "I'vegot3deadgirls,inmycar... "3 young ladies, that look just like me... "AndI 'mbringinghimchicken..." Who's hungry? What happened? Oh! ... Oh, my God... Oh. What a funny story... Where did you go? What? Um... Oh, you know... - The Garden Center. - The Garden Center... Wait a minute! So... I am... just Leaning over looking at the Azalea's, and I tripped and fell... And landed in a pile of mulch... Oh, you poor thing! . Crazy. All the flowers are dead. I mean it's a terrible location. I mean it's like... whoa! Honey, I think that maybe ah... you should... maybe you should go inside and get cleaned up. Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm fine. Hi Grace, How are you? Hi, Grace... Oh! Sorry. - And ah... - Jonathan. Jonathan! I haven't seen you guys since... You know, the... welcome home party, right... that was...? How long ago was that? That was last night, wasn't it? Was it? And this is Shannon, our daughter. Lucy honey, you're shaking like a leaf. - Well that's a very pretty young girl. - Thank you. Thanks. Shannon is a sophomore at Northwestern. Do you wanna think about maybe... changing your hair color? Do you wanna think doing about that? Why? Well, aren't you afraid of that "Council Bluff Killer"? Lucy! Right, that is what they are calling him now, right? And you are exactly his type. Right... am I right? Right? - Am I wrong? - Well, maybe you should, Shannon. We can't let some lunatic govern how we live our life, Grace. - We can't? - Lucy! She's OK, she's OK. Honey? Honey? - Sweetie, are you OK? - She alright? Should I... She's OK, she's OK. Honey? Does anyone want chicken? - I say that's dishonest. - No, Lady bugs. Are Lady bugs the one's that bite the heads off their husbands? No, that's the Preying Mantis. - Hi. - Hi. Come on in, Lucy. - Oh, no, you don't want me. - Come on. Don't be shy. Is it cold? No. It's great. It is great. Are any of you guys married? - It's strange. - What's it like? - I don't know. - They say communication is the key. And honesty. - Once the check comes, I'm outta here. - Right, that will happen... I am! It's not that easy. He can't hurt me. It's all about me. - What are you doing? - What? You shouldn't be out here, you need your rest. I just wanted to try the pool. Here. It's fine... You should come inside. I don't want you to catch a cold. I'm fine, every thing's fine. Come to bed. Let me swim some more. I'll be in soon. OK. Just when I thought I made some new friends. I'm sorry you guys. I really I'm. I just... I know what I'm doing. Well, you're up early. - Gardening. - Ah. I hope you're feeling better you scared us to death. Yeah. Very dramatic, I am. This thing has everyone spooked. You're not alone. We just all have to keep a close eye on each other. You're right! So, how are these famous Azaleas? The what? The... From the Garden Center? Hey! Hi. Let's eat. - Is it there? - No. Well, it will get here. - Well? - No. - Is there someone we can call? - I did, and it's a recording. We're out of eggs. Sorry. That's OK. You know that this will never happen again... now that you and I are... you know really a team. I mean, together, we'll make sure this never... - I think I'm pregnant. - What? Maybe, I'm not... I don't... I'm not really sure. I guess it happened in Hawaii, if I even am, I don't know... Oh, God... OK, well ah... We gotta get one of those ah... one of those test. Or... Mom will know what to do. No, Ben, hang on. This is fantastic. This is great. Ben, it's too early to... Mom, guess what? ... You're just gonna get all worked... It's probably nothing! - Lucy's pregnant. - Oh, God, no... But we don't have any money for one of those test. What should we...? OK. OK, OK. Ben... So mom is gonna go and buy one of those test. and you're gonna go over her house and you're gonna take it... I'm just asking you to calm down, OK? We don't have to deal with this right now. Oh, my God! Where's the fucking check? I mean you're eating for two now, and all you have to eat is eggs? Jesus Christ... That's it. You're going to mom's, and I'm going to call the lottery. And I swear, where ever that check is, I promise you, it will be here when you get home. OK? Now go. - I gotta go get dressed... - No, no, no, no, just go, OK? Go. Now, Two lines, you're pregnant. One line, you're not. OK. Are you OK? You look exhausted. It's just been a rough week. How long is this thing gonna take? Oh... I remember while I was waiting to hear about Ben. I just thought I was going crazy. - Hear what about Ben? - If I was pregnant. You know, he loves you so much. You just mean so, so, much to him. At the wedding, you both looked so beautiful. And you! You looked like an angel sent from heaven. - Oh, well... - You did! Well then, I knew I could stop worrying about Ben... See, I'm his mother, and I worry. I know, that you will give him a good life. You've helped him so much already. You know. I know that... that you are the best thing that ever happened to him. You know what he does. I know that he loves you, and he needs you. Why didn't you tell anyone? There's nothing to tell. What are you talking about? Lucy, it's one line. It's OK. Oh, honey you've got time... Look, it will happen when you least expect it. I promise you! Oh, honey... Yes! Rosemary is not having a baby! Oh, my God! Finally a little luck! - I don't understand. - Nobody is buying that anymore. The first year of marriage is the hardest. I mean, that is what they always say... Fuck you! Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. I can't believe I just said that to you. - No, it's my fault. - No, it's not. I try very hard, but you know, when they grow up, and... however, whatever, whatever you did... Pauline, come with me. I have the car. Let's just go. Don't pack, let's just go. - Go where? - So I don't get the money, right? ... - Who cares? - What money? Come on. Pauline... - No, no, no, he's my boy. I can't... - Pauline... No. I love you. Benjamin. How are you doing sweetheart? No, she isn't. Honey, I want you to listen to mommy now. (Cell phone ringing) Hello? "Hi." Hi. "Sorry, mom told me about the test." Yeah, I'm not gonna have a baby. "Yeah." Ben, I'm really sorry, but I can't do this anymore. "I've got the check." What? "It came right after you left." Oh? "See you at home." - Sorry about that. - No problem. - You're a busy guy. - Yeah. OK, Leslie... guy who bought condoms... Mom with scouts... a dumb kid... Guy buying cigarettes... A mother and child... Ben, I'm home! Hello? Ben? Don't look at me like that, I wasn't going to leave without you. Ben! Ben! Hello? Come on, Kurt. There you go. I know it smells like dead bodies in here. But you'll get use to it, Kurt. OK? I did it, Kurt. I did it. It's not like I planned it. But nobody can say I didn't do it. I got my bird, and I got my check. Your really gonna like Canada, Kurt, they have... Well, I actually don't know what they have there but... I just know that we're gonna love it. I'm mad at you. I don't know how to begin. I'm in shock. - Ben, stop it! - You know, I didn't believe her. I said you were just upset because you weren't pregnant. Now that we are a team. Do you have any idea how disappointed I am? I'm not gonna sit here and listen to a lecture from you. Yes, you will! Ben, Ben, Ben.. Ben.. Ben.. Ben.. Ben... You can't hurt me. Remember... remember our little talk... OK? So, let's just calm down. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm realistic. Now, I know that marriage isn't easy and that... I may not be experienced in the ways of amore. But I know that. Ben, listen... I ah... might have married you under false pretenses... But, after spending time with you, I came to really you know, to really, really... And then you started killing people, Ben! And it's just too much! Marriages take work. This has been our biggest mistake. We have just been sitting back... Hoping for a miracle. Well, I've done a lot of the work already. Now, the first thing I did, was to eliminate all distraction. BEN! That hurts! This hurts. Your... When you kill people, you are hurting me, and you can not hurt me! OK, now you're just getting me on a technicality. Alright, come with me. I want to show you something. Help! Lucy! I really need you to be coherent. I went to a lot of trouble here. Ben! Now, Grace here, is gonna help us get through the rough spots. I can't do this, I can't do this... Leave, and she dies. Lucy, honey, please sit down. Let's try and act like adults. OK. Grace, scream, and I cut you. OK, Grace... when you have gotten yourself together. I'd like for you to tell me and Lucy... What it is we are doing wrong. I told you... I'm a family planner, not a marriage counselor. - I don't even have a degree. - It's the same ballpark. Ben, let her go! Just say... something. Is your marriage based on honesty, and mutual respect? Yes! No, it is not, Ben. I married you for the money, and you like to kill people. No... like to kill people? What? - They're burned in the yard? - I don't put them there! That was all you. I thought you were trying to help me there! Garden Center? Wink... wink. Here I thought we were a team. - A team? - Who did you kill? Grace, have you ever wanted something, so much... And when you couldn't have it you had to argh... - ...but you couldn't. - You're insane! - I'm not saying I'm proud of myself. - You seemed like such nice people. - Stop talking! - Such nice people! We are still nice people, but we're also in love... And love is scary, I'm starting to realize that now. I don't love you. - Yes, you do.. - I want to go home. Well, that depends on my partner here. Ben, You have a long ways ahead of you, OK? Don't live it like this. I'm not worth it. Not by a long shot. - I love you. - I don't love you. I love you. - Let me go! - Let me go too! All I want is to be able to kiss, you... and have you kiss me... And to feel you mean it. That's all I want. Ben, I don't know. Maybe if... - ... I hadn't been so... - Greedy. - And you hadn't... - Killed all those people? - ...killed all those people. - Maybe things... - Would have been different? - I wish they were. I really do. Suddenly, the money doesn't seem to matter much, does it? Grace... Lucy! Lucy, we're not done talking! Get back here! Lucy! Please, don't leave me, Lucy! Look at what you did! Lucy... I can't take it anymore. I can't take it... Just take something sharp, and stab me with it, and kill me with it... Bury me under the hedges with the rest of them... Excuse me. No one answered at the front door. Is everything OK? Detective! Mr. Keller, I need to ask you a few more questions. Do you mind if we go inside? - I ah, don't mean to be rude, but... - But what? Well, we're swimming here. So if you could maybe come back, tomorrow? Mr. Keller, I reviewed the surveillance tape from the... convenience store where you bought the ticket. Yeah? You're not on them. Excuse the mess. I'm still unpacking. Fine. I understand. So ah, you're asking me how I could have bought my lottery ticket... and still not be on the tape? - On point. - Well, you're obviously on the tape he just looks different. He's been working out. He's bigger. Not that much bigger. You're on the tape, don't be stupid, you're drunk. He's drunk, he's been swimming. I know why I'm not on the tape. You're on the tape! Detective, are you accusing him of something? Because if you are... I snapped her neck in the parking lot. I never even stepped foot in the store. That's how I'm not on that tape. Marriage is based on honesty. That is what Grace said. Sometimes the truth hurts. I'm sorry. You couldn't hurt me even if you wanted too. Alright, I want you two to sit down. We're gonna take this as calmly as possible. The more calmly we do this, the better off we'll be. - I want... the check. - Well, you don't get anything. - Unless, it's me. - Nobody wants you. You can have me. Mr. Keller, tell your wife to give me the gun. - You don't win. I won't let you. - Gimme the gun. - It's not fair! - Put that gun down, Mrs. Keller. - Just admit it, Lucy. - What? - You love me. - Shut up! - Mrs. Keller, give me that gun. - Just admit it, you love me. - I don't want too! - Give me the gun, Mrs. Keller. Add it to the pile. Can you turn that up, please? "They were as nice as can be." "He invited us to lunch, just the week before." "Looking back... looking back, she doesn't remember that night at all." "No, I hit my head, very hard..." "What happened afterwards?" "Well, after she was home safe, everyone..." Is this really "The Sunny Mart"? Why would I lie? - Kurt says "hello". - What are you doing here? - No, no, I mean he actually says "Hello" - What do you want? I ah... I wanted to make that sure you're OK. Lucy, I didn't think it was gonna end this way. You didn't? I told them that it was me! Those women under the hedge... they had your DNA, or your fibers, or whatever all over them. I mean, you shot Detective Waylon! I know what I did. What about, what you did? Well... I think, we should just put the past behind us... I asked you a question. How much does a jury cost nowadays? Is it expensive? Jonathan and Grace, they cost a lot of money, ...is there any money left? At all? Mom says hello. I'm gonna get out of here, and I'm gonna set you on fire. - Did you get any of my letters? - I mean it... fire! OK, OK, ah... I love you anyway. Wait, wait! I know you, Ben. And ah, pretty soon... Tonight even... You're gonna go home, and you're gonna get to thinking about me... How much you love me. How we belong together, and... How you still, don't really have me... And when some 27 year old blond woman, about 5'6", 125 lbs... doesn't come back from her aerobics class... Everybody's gonna know, what's, what. I don't expect to be here much longer. Not long at all. - I don't think that's gonna happen. - And then I gonna set you on fire! You may be right...ah you normally are, but ah... Since you've been here, I just I haven't had that urge. It's not that I like the idea of you rotting away in here, I don't... Get out. - Get out! Get out... - It just makes me feel. ...and don't ever come back here! Ever! Guard! Guard! Hello, I'm ready to go back. Take me back! - I love you, Lucy! - I'm ready to go. Take me away! - I love you! - Screw you! Fuck you! Goodbye, Lucy! Ben, wait, wait! I have time, I still have time left... Ben. Ben! Yes? It's almost been a year now... I know. Would you like me to come back? Yes. Would you? Of course. Tomorrow? I'll be here. - Kurt spoke? - Yeah, I was at the house maybe Wednesday, or Thursday, and ah... What did he say? "Hello" "Hello", that's what he says. Just "hello", all the time. Around... around the clock. Have you been working out? Aaahhh.... Ben, no skipping. You're screw it all up and turn puny again! I know, it's just... I really need someone to motivate me. It's so boring. Ben, what do you want? Somebody to hold your hand? You just have to get in there and do it! OK... Hey, just don't say "OK". Just do it! - OK. - Promise me. I promise. You gonna work that chest tomorrow? If you find any problems with this sub... So they'd say I agreed to it and since it was my responsibility for getting drunk, I'd be the one blamed. You aren't the bad one. I... I'd like to get revenge on him myself. But... That company said they can't give out any personal information about their members. Takeuchi-san, what are you asking us to do this time around? I want you to find out what you can about that guy Hayami's background. Because I never want to have to cry myself to sleep again. Well, what should we do? Find out about this waste of a man and throw him over to the police, right? We can't allow him to have any more victims. You say we should find out about him, huh... It won't be easy getting them to tell us about him. They don't have to tell us; we'll steal it from them. Steal it? First off, we do a preliminary check into their security setup work up an invasion method and, once we're sure there are no issues, carry out our strategy. Then, I'll count on you for the best method. Me? ! "We can't allow him to have any more victims." When you quit your job, you told me this. "I just want to grasp onto a common, ordinary happiness"... I'm sure she's thinking the same thing. Mission start. If you don't hurry, Kyoutaro-kun will have come home. I'll take it... as a part-time job, right? I see. You serve with Air Ocean Pacific. Yes. Since I'm continuously flying between countries, it's tough meeting anyone so I'm here determined to take the plunge. Cabin Attendants are quite the popular occupation at this firm. Our company is... "The important part of a preliminary check is bringing back as much information as possible." "The number and position of enemy security cameras, along with possible escape routes, just in case." "And the location of any confidential information..." Well then, let's move along to the registration right away. Fill in everything here. Excuse me... There's one thing I'm particularly worried about... What's that? Just who ends up with access to the information I put in this registration... Since member's addresses and places of employment are considered our most private of profiles our system is such that only the President can read them. "When you want to know about their security, the best way is to get the enemy to tell you." But, if the President's computer was hacked into... Member information is held not in data form but as documents and those are held in perfect safety in that safe over there. Still... Who knows the pin number for that? I give that to no one. It's a number that only I know and I change it on a random basis. President. This is Ueno-sama, who will be joining us today. Her occupation is as a Cabin Attendant. Ah, a CA, huh? Nice to meet you. I'm the company representative, Kiryu. Thank you very much for enrolling with us today. It would make me very happy if I could have a relationship with a doctor. Is there anyone nice here like that? "All done." "Thank you very much." Did you get it... The analysis of the pin number? Oh, hang on a sec. 4, 5, 9, 7, 5, 6. Hayami's not here. Why? "That President knew that Hayami was raping women..." "Could it be said... Hayami and Kiryu are accomplices?" Erika-chan? Oh, Erika-chan, what's the matter? It was bothering me if I had forgotten to set the timer on the rice cooker again. Ah, you're such the worrywart. Hurry and come to bed. Good night! When I checked into Hayami's school days he was at a different university from Kiryu's. They seem to have met at the same sports club. That's how the two of them became buddies. How's Hayami's reputation at his work? "Matsushima General Hospital" He has a favorable reputation as a surgeon at Matsushima General Hospital. However, this guy is the lowest form of man... What is it? He's got a girlfriend? No. Not a girlfriend, but a fiancée. Fiancée? The hospital Director's only daughter, Matsushima Misako. The two of them are planning to get married in the spring of next year. In that case, that'd mean Hayami will be the next Director? Looks like marriage fraud, doesn't it? Even though he has a fiancée, he goes to a marriage search circle. The two of them as a group are preying on women. What's more, their next target is... Me. Um, what should we do now? Our first plans were to find out about Hayami's background. Her goal is revenge. "I'd like to get revenge on him myself." Eh? Then, now to the police? There's much to do before turning him over. We have to be thorough. - Hayami. - Huh? The next omiai party is coming up this Sunday. Sunday, huh... Sorry. Misako and I have a prior engagement. You and your fiancée can meet any day from now on, can't you? Our latest member is a CA hoping to get a doctor as her marriage partner. You'd like this one. Here. All right. I'll go. You'd better do well this time around. Um, that woman Hitomi... She came by asking for your phone number; it was pretty dicey. You didn't tell her of course? As long as you're with my company. Once you start talking marriage, you'll have to drop out. Doctors are good bait for attracting women, after all. Kiryu. Are you threatening me? That's not a threat. It's just advice so your playing around doesn't get exposed. Kyoutaro. You and me are making dinner tonight. Me and Papa? On our days off, we have to let Erika-chan have some time off too, don't we? Let's all have fun tonight and make it a hand-rolled sushi party! Ah, I'm sorry... I promised to go out with a friend tonight. A friend who's more important than us? Kyoutaro-kun... She's not saying that, Kyoutaro. In that case, could you call the girl to join us? Truth is, that girl has been seeing a terrible boyfriend. So she's asked me to discuss it with her. I see... That is a worry, isn't it? You two wait up for me. I'll hurry home as soon as I can. Where's this CA you've been talking about? The woman in the red dress. Thank you. Kyaa! I'm very sorry. I'm not used to these shoes. Since you normally wear shoes without heels, you must be in the service industry? You really know your stuff. Because your smile is so natural. Are you a store assistant? Receptionist? A CA? Incredible! I am a CA. Are you a doctor? How do you know? You have the scent of disinfectant about you. Ehh... You're correct. I just finished an operation. Is that right. This wine is delicious. Could I have another glass? Thank you. Hey, isn't Erika-san overdoing the drinking? Long ago, she smashed up 6 Russian men. All by herself. - 6 of them? - "It's delicious." "It's not strong, is it?" Well, it's just about time. Ah, I'm off. Hayami-san seems I've had too much fun chatting with you and drunk too much. Might be best to go somewhere for a little while and rest. Yes... Could you take me? Sure. You okay? Here. Take this; it's medicine. Medicine? To sober you up. Thank you. Sensei, you're so kind. Oi, Erika! That guy... How are you feeling? Shall I examine you? I could only do that with someone I was considering marrying... Well then, let's get married. No way. You probably propose to everyone... No. When I first met you earlier it really brought things into focus for me. In what way? Somehow... I feel sleepy... Because you're a stupid woman. Excuse me! Shun... What are you doing? Misako! What are you doing here? ! I got a call from one of your friends! "Don't get married to Shun." "If you come here, you'll find the reason why." Friend? ! Who was it? Someone named Kiryu-san. Kiryu? ! More importantly, who is this woman? ! I happened to be drinking with her by chance when she started not feeling well. I was nursing her. Ala? Hayami-san, who is this? I'm the one he's engaged to! And who are you? ! Engaged? Hayami-san, if you're engaged, what are you doing at a marriage search circle for? ! Marriage search circle? Hey, what is this? ! The reason is... When you said we should get married earlier, that was a lie, wasn't it? ! What on earth is this about, Shun? ! Everyone, what's going on? That should be my line! Kiryu! That you would do this to me here... Are you the one who called me? Called you? After all, the one who called me earlier was you! You seriously did? No way I would do that to you, Hayami. Because he knew about your affair, wasn't it? You're wrong. Misako, you're wrong. I'm breaking up with you! Our engagement is over, too! Misako, wait! Oi! Wait! Kiryu... You did this to me out of resentment? ! Why would I? Don't play dumb! After I got married, you thought I'd escape from you. Then you wouldn't be able to sucker women anymore. The one setting himself up for future trouble using this place to grab women was you, wasn't it? Even that woman, too! I guess you two are friends. You... Why isn't the drug I gave you earlier working? You mean this drug? Because I didn't take it. Could it be the one who called Misako here was you? "You're Matsushima Misako-san, aren't you?" "I'm Hayami's friend, Kiryu..." I guess it was you who screwed us over... We were tricked! Tricked? The ones who tricked first were you two. Huh? Hayami-san, even though you had a fiancée you'd come here to this marriage search circle and rough up women. What? Kiryu-san, you approved of this man's criminal actions. No... you were the one who instigated them. Your evidence? In that case, I've been recording EVERYTHING you've been saying just now. With this camera here. While you were quarreling, right? Both Kiryu-san and Hayami-san. While we're waiting for the police, let's have some fun investigating. Were we the only ones in the wrong? Those women played their part too, didn't they? I just say I'm a doctor and they come out of the woodwork. Saying "marriage" is like flies to honey for those stupid women. They're everywhere, dreaming of their perfect prince. What's wrong of dreaming of a perfect prince? Even if you think winning one is impossible it's the same belief you get when you buy tickets for a lottery. For women to have someone close to them all their lives... They look desperately for just that one person! The feelings of such women... Trash like you will never understand that, even until you die. This bitch. Don't think you can get out of here. Stop it. Spare me. The mission is complete! This party has adjourned. Excuse me for leaving first. Kyoutaro tried his hardest to stay awake. I'm sorry. For not eating with you. Were you able to settle your friend's troubles? Yeah. But, it made me realize it once again. That I had won this huge lottery. - Lottery? - Yeah. She wanted your advice over money? That was a parable. Women have lots of things going on. Ah, I see. Say, you're hungry, aren't you? Sit down, sit down. I was especially good at picking out the sushi for today. Really? I'll make it for you. - Then... Salmon! - Salmon it is. "Marriage Search Circle President Arrested" "Kiryu Nobuya (36)" "Hayami Shun (36)" Takeuchi Hitomi-san came by to thank us. "I'm going to work hard and not be in a such a rush to get married," she said. It's all thanks to Erika-san. She hasn't changed one bit. Even if she has become a housewife. Was she really that frightening in the past? Eh... It says Naichou Information Officers met with the Prime Minister. Ah, speaking of which Totsuka-san, why did you leave the Naichou? There! "Internet Bulletin Board's Insidious Harassment of OLs" "Escalating Crimes" "This Drama is Fictional" After 42 years of tyrannical rule, Colonel Gaddafi is dead. World leaders marked him out. I think today is a day to remember all of Colonel Gaddafi's victims. But one of Gaddafi's most ruthless henchmen is still on the run. We tracked him down to his 5-star hideaway in the sun. How many people are you responsible for torturing Mr. Koussa? Moussa Koussa helped propel the Gaddafi regime for four decades. But he was also Britain's secret friend. Tonight: how we colluded with him to kidnap Gaddafi's opponents around the world, whilst he was organizing torture and even inflicting abuse himself. While I was being questioned, Moussa Koussa was shocking me in my neck with the electric rod. And for the first time, the secret torture tapes, incontrovertible proof of Gaddafi's crimes against humanity. Britain, Gaddafi and the Torture Trail 5-star luxury [? ] hotel in Qatar. Among the international businessmen and the jet-setting playboys, is this man: Moussa Koussa. He was one of Colonel Gaddafi's inner circle, a ruthless spy chief trusted with the security of the country and stamping out dissent. He is now on the run. But what's intriguing is that when he fled Libya at the start of the uprising, he chose to defect to Britain. Moussa Koussa is still being questioned at a secret location tonight and he's said to be in a very fragile state of mind. His resignation shows that Gaddafi's regime is fragmented, under pressure, and trembling from within. Moussa Koussa was at the heart of Gaddafi's regime. It's long been said "he was involved with the Lockerbie bombing." He should also know who was responsible for the shooting of policewoman "Yvonne Fletcher" outside the Libyan Embassy in 1984. So his defection here in March, was an opportunity to get to the truth. Moussa Koussa is responsible for the death of 270 innocent civilians as well as thousands of his own people as part of the Gaddafi regime. No matter what he says now, he has to be held accountable for my brother's death and the death of thousands of others. Now, with Gaddafi dead, Moussa Koussa is the guardian of many of Libya's secrets. So why, with little explanation, did Britain let him go? Now free, Libya is still surrendering its secrets. For four decades it was closed to the world. In recent years we saw only a reformed clown, a fading tyrant with pantomime policies, sitting on a lake of oil. But beneath the organized pro-Gaddafi parties, this was a nation terrorized by secret police, where neighbor informed on neighbor. Now, those who were once targeted are the ones in charge. In Tripoli four weeks ago, I was invited out with a snatch team whose job was to capture remnants of the former regime. They were hunting 25 of Gaddafi's armed supporters hiding out in a dangerous part of town called "Abu Salim". Here is the very people who up until a few weeks ago were being rounded up and captured by Gaddafi regime loyalists and now, they're the ones doing the hunting. An informant had already told them that quarry would fight to death. Then, incoming fire. These buildings are dangerous because they're the hiding place for torturers and guards. People who once worked in Libya's most notorious political prison, just around the corner. It's in the south of Tripoli, and it's where Gaddafi used to dump his political opponents: real and imagined. Nearly everybody you speak to in Libya has some kind of dark story about what happened to a friend or a relative behind these walls. This is Abu Salim prison. And it's a symbol really of the unbridled brutality of Gaddafi's regime. When Tripoli failed, the inmates of Abu Salim began freeing themselves. They hacked open cell doors with anything they could find. You can see the desperate faces of people who had been locked away here for up to 30 years. One of them was this man: "Sami al-Saadi". This is my cell. - This is it. - From 2007. Sami was brought here for being the deputy leader of a fighting group intent on assassinating Gaddafi. He was holed in front of a Kangaroo court, and sentenced the same day. This is the red uniform, for execution uniform. It has the same color of the blood and indicates too that this person will be killed. - And this is the uniform that you wore, once you were here? - Yeah. They were very happy when they gave me this. - Were they? How do you know they were happy? Were they smiling? - Yeah, smiling and joking. Whilst on death row, Sami was interrogated and tortured. But remarkable thing is it was the UK which helped send him here into the hands of Moussa Koussa who then ran Libya's intelligence service. Moussa Koussa once lived in London. In 1980 he was the Libyan ambassador. But he was expelled for backing a plan to murder two of Gaddafi's opponents living in the UK. His official role for more than a decade was Libya's chief of spies. After Tripoli fail, his old offices were abandoned and torched. But some documents survived. They exposed Libya's secret relationship with the UK, in the series of letters between Moussa Koussa and MI6. These documents are absolutely extraordinary. They show the real detail of the secret relationship between Britain and America, and Gaddafi's police state. And what really is amazing is the tone of them, the friendliness, they're cozy and [? ] at some stages. And, I guess the people who wrote them just thought they would never see the light of day. They show one senior MI6 officer looking forward to lunch with Moussa Koussa over Christmas, and signing of the letter: "Your friend, Mark". But that's not all. The documents show British spies were engaged in something far more sinister, something illegal. The letters show that our secret services colluded with Moussa Koussa to kidnap or render Sami Al-Saadi and others. They were Gaddafi's political opponents living abroad. And at the height of the war on terror, Britain considered them terrorists. In fact, back in the 90s, Sami had lived in London. He had been given political asylum. I used to go to market, John Lewis. Kwiksave, Safeway and Sainsbury's. But after he left, MI6 became suspicious about his Islamic connections. They helped to range for him to be snatched from an airport in the Far East and returned to Libya and Moussa Koussa. Sami and his wife were hooded and bundled onto a plane with their four young children. They put black plastic on our faces, me and my wife. Later on my wife said to me, "I thought that they will execute us". In the very same week we handed Sami over in 2004, Tony Blaire arrived to meet with Gaddafi in the desert. He was our new ally in the war against terror. In the background, our friend Moussa Koussa. As Blaire enjoyed the hospitality, Koussa found time to slip away for a chat with the newly-imprisoned Sami. He said to me: "Sami, now I can pick up the phone and speak to MI6. They co-operate with us against you, and told us about the more recent information about you. And helped us to arrest you." Other documents show just how close the relationship is becoming. In one, a senior MI6 officer said "the rendition of a Gaddafi opponent was the least we can do for you", and described the prisoner simply as "cargo". But how was that cargo, which we'd helped deliver, treated once arrived in Abu Salim prison. Libya was giving reassurances that after rendition, none of these prisoners would face any harm. But, what were their reassurances really worth? We were dealing with a secretive police state notorious for torturing and even murdering its political opponents, and yet we were sending people back here, on trust. Earlier this month, I was out with a raid team again in Tripoli. They thought they'd found another part of Libya's former spy network: a local security office. This is the scene they meet where they're not even looking for people to arrest. This is where they're trying to find stashes of secret documents that are still emerging around Tripoli. Inside, mobile prisons used to house captured opponents. And shelves of intelligence used to incriminate them. But elsewhere, they found something more chilling. Among the team today, a man who was himself an inmate at Abu Salim prison. He was tortured with electric shocks. Some of the equipment they've seized is sickeningly familiar to him. This is an electric rod which they started torturing me with from the first day. Torture was by pressing it on my chest. They used the electric rod here on my chest. And then I kept saying "I don't know anything, I don't know anything." Panorama has now discovered evidence which supports his claims. The regime that we were doing secret deals with was filming its torture. The evidence comes from the burnt-out ruins of Abu Salim prison itself. Amongst the debris, some crucial evidence did survive. Panorama has acquired hours of footage which shows the truth about how this regime treated some of its political opponents. It's chilling stuff, much way far too gruesome to broadcast. But we can show you some. This was filmed in May this year. A prisoner, blindfolded, and waiting. The instrument being used is similar to the one Adel from the raid] team showed us. The man in the suit is from something called the interrogation committee. In the 1980s, Moussa Koussa was said to be its director. This footage was a small fraction of what we found. There are more, whippings, electric shocks, beatings, all of which reinforce the claims of others. Like Nouri Al-Burki. He used to work for Moussa Koussa in the security service. But he was suspected of being a double agent and working for foreign spy networks. There were about nine to ten beatings. My body died and I couldn't feel anything anymore. But then they grabbed the metal instrument which is a type of stapler used by traders to staple large cardboard boxes, and they began to - I apologize to the viewers about this - they put my testicles inside the stapler and then they pressed. Even before the torture started Nouri had been paraded in front of his old boss: Moussa Koussa; the man MI6 would invite for Christmas lunch. He was there when I was arrested and he saw me being blindfolded just saw he could come and take a statement for me. He was sitting down and he was very relaxed. I was in a really sad state. He was leading the session and everyone was sitting in their own chair. But he didn't know that you were being badly treated necessarily. He knew that I've been tortured and that my honor had been violated. He knew that very well. And tonight, we can show that Britain's friend, Moussa Koussa, was attached to the bloodiest massacre of Gaddafi's regime. When we searched former intelligence offices bombed out by NATO, we managed to salvage some of the regime's surveillance tapes. They show men gathering outside a mosque. Gaddafi didn't just round up political opponents, but religious ones too. This was taken during one of his random clampdowns on Muslims. They picked out those who appeared the most devout and jailed them. Some were never seen again. This man was one of those arrested. Today, picking up his young son from school, few know what he went through as an inmate in Abu Salim prison. At the time, Abdul Atti Zahmol was a 24 year old moderate Muslim. He was taken to Abu Salim with no idea when he'd be released. Conditions were even worse in 1996. Malnutrition, no medicine, no electricity, no clean water. One day, a group of young inmates rebelled. The prison guard opened the door and they took the keys from him and they beat him up and they tried to escape. When the young man came out from the sector, they came out and they set off. They were aiming to escape but they found that this door was locked. They couldn't get out. The guard pulled out his machine gun. Hundreds of prisoners were herded into the court yards. The guards moved to the rooftop walkways, machine guns trailed on the inmates below. Shortly after 11 o'clock, they were ordered to fire. We had screams and beatings, and from 11 to 1:30 we had continuous shooting. We didn't know what happened exactly and how many were killed. We didn't guess that they killed just about everyone. More than 1200 inmates were slaughtered that day. It took nearly 3 hours. Abdul Atti only survived because he was hidden by a sympathetic guard. Now Panorama can reveal that one of the regime's inner circle present as the massacre unfolded was Moussa Koussa, at the time, chief of spies. This man, Muftah Al-Thawadi, saw him. He spent nearly 2 decades in jail, 8 years of it in isolation. His cell had just a hole in the ceiling for light. On the day of the massacre, Muftah was negotiating face-to-face with Moussa Koussa on behalf of the prisoners. Moussa Koussa was careful to make sure he was present, so he was there from the beginning, and he made threats, said to me personally. He don't deserve to live. He often made threats. Moussa Koussa was there and he was among those who promised the prisoners that if they went back to their cells, nothing would happen to them, but they were betrayed. They killed 1200 prisoners. And Moussa Koussa was amongst those who carry the responsibility for this massacre. When Moussa Koussa came to Abu Salim prison, people say he used these rooms as his offices. Often he would leave the interrogation to his juniors and he'd sit here and wait for the victim to be delivered with confession into his presence. On other occasions, he'd be the one delivering the blows. First, they stripped me and while I was being questioned, Moussa Koussa was shocking me in the neck with the electric rod. And then, while I was talking he told me "shut up!" and struck me with the electric rod on my tooth here and broke it. The man that UK made deals with over rendition and who gave assurances there'd be no torture, had actually tortured people himself. Weeks into the Libyan uprising, Moussa Koussa began to make his move. He arrived at the Rixos hotel in Tripoli to announce a bogus ceasefire on behalf of the regime. Libya has declared an immediate ceasefire and the stoppage of all military operations. It was a rare public appearance from such a secretive figure, by now Gaddafi's foreign minister. At the time, his colleagues were shouting for the blood of rebels. But those present said Moussa Koussa looked uncomfortable, shaky even. He was clearly struggling to toe the party line. Now we know why: these were his last days in Libya. Soon after, he slipped away. He crossed the border into Tunisia, and then on to a country trusted with whom he'd done grubby business before: the UK. He arrived by a private jet at Farnborough airbase, and was then whisked off to a safe house. He was protected by special branch offices, and agreed to be interviewed briefly by Lockerbie investigators. As reward for his defection, his assets in the West were unfrozen. Now he could tap into his significant wealth. The government came under pressure over questions about why Moussa Koussa hadn't been arrested. They promised there'd be no secret deal. Let me be clear. Moussa Koussa is not being granted immunity. There is no deal of that kind. The prime minister and I have made clear there's no immunity from prosecution. There will be no immunity. He hasn't asked for that. BBC News arranged a night-time meeting with Moussa Koussa through British officials. They won't allow questions, there'd just be statements. And I personally have relations and good relations with so many Britons. We work together against terrorism. Then Koussa said he was off just for a few days for a meeting about the future of Libya to be held in the Gulf state of Qatar. The British government allowed him to leave. He never came back. When we asked the foreign office why they allowed Moussa Koussa to go on his apparently endless trip to Qatar, they said: "Moussa Koussa is a private individual who is free to travel to and from the UK. It's not our place to provide a running commentary on his movements or his current activities." But didn't we ask for some kind of reassurance he was going to come back here, maybe send somebody with him. Same response again: "not our place to provide a running commentary." But what about the torture? Well they said: "we never condoned torture." and asked for the specific allegations, "those are something you need to take up with the Libyan authorities." So it was left to ours to find him. We suspected he was still in Qatar, the tiny Arab Emirate in the Persian Gulf. Perhaps the UK let him go because he knew secrets which the British government would prefer never to surface. A man with his wealth would choose only the most exclusive and discretive places. We found him in a 5-star hotel in Doha. And here he is, in the corner of the restaurant, scouring the room for anyone suspicious. On the right of screen is his bodyguard. He knows Moussa Koussa could be assassinated at any moment. Hello Mr. Koussa. BBC Television. How many people are you responsible for torturing Mr. Koussa? How many people are you responsible for torturing? Mr. Koussa! Some of them you tortured yourself, didn't you? What do you want? These are all questions the international criminal courts... These are all questions the international criminal courts want to ask Mr. Koussa. They're very important questions. I want to know his role also in the massacre of over a thousand people in 1996. Just I asked what I want to know! Mr. Koussa! Mr. Koussa! I'm interested in your role in the massacre of maybe a thousand people in 1996. Were you involved at all? Ok, go! Qatari government security intervened and confiscated our footage. But, what they didn't realize was that we'd secretly filmed with our other two cameras. With all the rest of Gaddafi's family and inner circle either dead or on the run, there're bound to be more questions about why such an important figure was allowed to leave the UK. Moussa Koussa, to be honest, Western governments should know the truth about him. He is a murderer and a criminal, and his only concern was that his corrupt regime which ruled Libya with iron and fire should remain in power. This is why it's imperative that the West must hand over this criminal to justice, and he must receive his punishment. Back in Libya, on rough deserts behind Abu Salim prison, Abdul Atti is searching for the body of his brother. He was killed in the prison massacre. My brother was a really beloved man, in every sense of that word. He knew God's book. He was a much better man than I am, to be honest. Sami is here too. The Gaddafi opponent jailed after a deal between Britain and Moussa Koussa. He had two brothers killed in the same event. Now families are digging for the bodies of more than a thousand missing inmates. The Earth is starting to surrender its secrets. But the truth about Gaddafi's murderous regime lies with the still living. The people who committed these crimes against humanity, and who, in the end, will have to account for what they did. Translation: Rollins Timing: qop123 QC: Ahartono99 Misaki Number One! You all look so sleepy. We were watching a DVD at Hoshi's place. It was a really scary horror movie! So everyone was so scared they couldn't sleep? That's not it. It wasn't that surprising. it was scary. What is it? I felt like someone was watching me. No one is there. - Yeah. - Stop with the scary stories. you're so easily scared. Morning. What the hell? It's Mikuni. - Don't scare us! - I was scared. - Morning... - Isn't he a bit down? he's usually so happy. Hmm? That's amazing! We have so many people to Waseda University and Keio University! such a nice thing to see. we'll have one of the best results in the whole country! This year's senior class was really good. It's thanks to the hard work of their homeroom teachers! Great job! Congratulations! Good luck to our 2nd year teachers too. Yes! Yes... We got some good grades in last month's mock exams. But! It seems like the grades in D class are the only ones to fall. which is Mikuni-sensei's area. I'm very sorry. the 2nd years are going to be 3rd years studying for university exams. We need our D homeroom teacher to do his best. Yes. Mikuni-sensei. Hmm? then the results in my class were actually pretty good! - Tennoji-sensei. - Hmm? Why are you talking like you're daydreaming? But you just said... No one passed from 2-Z! What? I don't think any of them applied to do it. I see. Stalker? Probably. Probably your imagination. but no one was there. that was just then... who would stalk Yui? Yeah! What do you mean! ? girls always have crazy imaginations. What? You think that guys look at you like that anyway? You guys actually think you understand a woman? What? That's why you aren't popular. What now! ? What about it! ? did anything else happen? Yeah. I feel like someone has been watching me a couple times already. Before... On my way back home... I felt like someone was following me along the way. That's scary. Is there anything else out of ordinary? And then I got a call from a private number... Hello? A silent call. - A stalker? - Maybe... It sounds like the stalker is actually getting worse... be careful. - Really? - This is bad. What can we do? I can't forgive that is bigger. Look, I'll see you in a bit. Okay, okay. Bye. Dick. Dick. Hey, you. - Hi. - Hi. You look smart. - Here in your suit. - This old thing. - Here we go. - Thank you. Oh, stop it. Do you see? But I'm just fed up with it. It's meant to make your life so easy. "Broadband makes your life so easy." I mean, that's the campaign. I spent the morning on the phone, talking to a man who clearly thought I had a degree in computer science, and who, frankly, I couldn't really understand. I know, I felt bad pointing out that I was struggling with his accent, but after a couple of hours, I got the hang of it, and we had a lovely chat about his family. You got your broadband sorted out, right? No, but I've adopted an elephant called Maude. That's hilarious. That's what you should be writing about in your novel. - You think? - Yes. You're far more interesting than those wankers you have to write about. According to Cheryl, I'm a failed novelist. You're not a failed novelist. You're a scared one. Smoked fish and chips ice cream. Hold it in your mouth for 10 seconds, and enjoy the memories. Oh, by the way, about earlier. When I said that I... About the fancying thing... I clearly have no sense of humor. - Oh, well, I clearly am not funny. - We should do a double act. Yeah. No jokes, no laughs, just awkward misunderstandings. - We'd be a sellout. - It makes me laugh. It's this Grimandi guy. His relentless stream of shit just permeates my mind. Nice imagery. Mm. - I feel 16 again. - Really? Freshly cut grass. Long summers. - It really takes me back. - Well, that's apparently what he does. Taste is meant to make you feel again. It does. He's a genius. Mm. It tastes like magic. It's incredible. Jed. I feel like I'm at the seaside. Just been for a swim in the sea. Mm. Standing on the pier. The sun shining on my face. It's exactly how fish and chips used to taste when you were a kid. They just don't taste like this anymore. Mm. No one would believe us if we told them. You're right. He's a genius. So tell me about this Grimandi's philosophy of love. Well, he thinks that the greater the meeting, the falling, the better chance a relationship has. He believes in sparks. Do you believe that? I don't know what I believe. Thank you. Sweet beef with a roast potato and leek custard, served on a bed of chocolate jelly and bacon. Enjoy. Okay, this is officially the best present anyone has ever given me. You're a very special man, Jed. - Cheers. - Cheers. A whole baby pigeon wrapped in marzipan really should be disgusting. It reminded me of my first boyfriend. Isn't the taste incredible? Actually, it was the little turned-up nose and the bony feet. It's funny. What is? Nothing. Nothing's funny. Nothing's funny. You don't smoke. I know. It's love. I mean, it's really love. - I think it is. - Do you? Such a fine line between being in love and being cared in the community. So you think it is love? I mean, I'm really in love. - Oh, for God's sake. - I need to know, mate. I mean, it feels like it is but how do I know? Does she make you feel like you could give up everything else in your life for her? I think she does. Would your life be intolerable without her? Yes. Does she make you feel like you felt when you were happy? Even if happiness is a myth. Yes. Yeah, she does. Could you leave your partner for her, regardless of the consequences? I think I could. Then, my friend, you're in love. Cheers. I keep hitting the shift key, and I just get this error thing. Listen. What? Do I...? Yes, of course I know what a shift key is. Okay, I'll try the other one. Same thing, same thing. Do I...? I'm sorry, I don't... Look, is Ranjit Vinsaka there? He understands me. Oh, is he? Oh, dear. No... Why do you need my postal code now? We're past that, you've been helping me. You don't need my post... N-5-4-P-F. N. No, N for Norwich. Norman. For naan. Naan. Five. Yeah. Four. Four. Four. No, just one four. Forget it. There's coffee in the pot. You don't drink coffee. Thought I'd give it a whirl. No luck with the broadband? No, it's not for me. Good night? Good. Yours? Good. Thanks. Good. Are you all right? I'm fine. - I'll take a shower, then. - Yeah, I better get back to work. He's having an affair. Are you sure? A woman knows. Yeah, I suppose they do. Has he said anything? Of course not. Fucking coward. Has he said anything to you? No. Oh, Jed. I saved that bastard's sorry little life. Yeah, you did. Mind you, is that a reason to be with someone? I don't know why I called you. Don't know what I wanted you to say. This is pointless. No. Wait, I... I need to find Marcus. - She knows you're having an affair. - I know. - She wanted to know if I knew anything. - Did you tell? Of course not! I'm not gonna do your dirty work for you. I'm gonna tell her tonight. - Tell her what? - I'm leaving. - What? - I'm leaving. I just quit this nonsense too. - What? - Yeah, Kate and I are gonna live in Paris. We're in love, Jed. Do you understand? Kate and I are in love. - Paris? - Didn't I mention Kate's French? - French? - Shh. Are you just gonna repeat everything that I say? Look, this is madness. I'm glad you're pleased for me. This is real this time. No tricks. - Tricks? - See, you're doing it again. I gotta go. How can you leave someone who loves you? Oh, it's easy. She doesn't love me, and I don't love her. But she saved your life. No, she didn't. Sorry. But love is never what it seems. Maybe love is nothing more than a confidence trick. If we can deceive others, we can deceive ourselves. We can make ourselves believe anything we want to believe. We only know our own truth, nobody else's, but we must know our own. We must know it. You were right. I proposed hoping you'd say no. I'm not in love with you, but I couldn't admit that to you, to myself. I needed you to leave me. I'm a coward. Sorry. I think we met at a time when we both needed something in our lives. I think that's what it was, and I think that has nothing to do with love. We were just kids. Pissed, lonely kids. - So the proposal was an endgame. - Yeah. Fascinating. - I was right. - Yeah. And what made you realize this? You said it yourself. Working isn't enough. Wonderful. This is wonderful. Why don't you just shut up? I'm sorry. It may not feel like it now, but this is a success story, Cheryl. Success? You came here to separate, and now you achieve it. Do you really believe that he...? Do you think that...? Because I... I want... I want to feel something. I haven't felt anything for... Even when we met, we were numb on drink and drugs and life, and I thought being together was enough. You know, other people fall in love. They talk about it all the time. They write songs about it, for chrissake. I just... I never really believed them. It's all my bloody magazine talks about. I think I might want to fall in love. I'm nearly 40 and I've never done it. I want something to feel. I want a story to tell. I want my beginning. No, she went fucking mental. - She kept telling me what a twat I am. - You are. She knows it's not true. She's just upset, which is fine. Whatever's best for her. Plus grieving, I suppose. Grieving. God, I hadn't thought about the grieving. I hope you can help Sophie through this. Me? Why? Well, because you get each other. You know, she's always going on about you. If I cared, I'd think she had a thing about you. Don't be ridiculous. Look, me and Kate are leaving on Friday. We're on the first train out of here. And just so you know, I'm not proud of myself. Sorry about you and Cheryl. It's a fucking minefield. See you, man. I tell you, love is, of course, a prominent subject in my life. - As well as sex. - Love you, Thierry. Get the number of this woman. And if it was a man, get him a good surgeon. So Thierry, you've said before that love can sometimes be a confidence trick. Now, do you truly believe that, or is it simply a motif in your films? There is no such a thing as a motif in a film. Film is my life. My life is film. And in La Fin du Commencement, was she really a prostitute? Monsieur Jed, she was no more a prostitute than he thought she was. He made it up. He knew if he could pull off a beginning like that they'd have a real chance at love. - So he never thought she was. - Of course not. He wanted a beginning. That's not love, that's deception. I like that. How should it feel? I mean, when you feel it, when you know, when you think, when you find it, how should it...? For you, what are the signs? The coffee. The coffee? The taste is different. Love is tasting different. Love is sepia. Seeing a woman's lips, her eyelashes, her fingernails, her soul. Love is sickness. Longing. Illness. Love is... Love is close-ups. Now, let me show the scene from La Suicide Amour. - You know it? - I'm ashamed to say I haven't seen it yet. It is a film about romantic deception, where love and mendacity collide in beauty. In beauty. WOMAN MAN Thank you. I'm so sorry. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Not only does he run off with someone from maths class, he pretended to fucking kill himself so that he... Jesus. We don't actually know that's what he did. That's exactly what he did. - Well, Sophie, I mean... - Don't try and defend him, Jed. What made you come today? I wanted to make some sense of what he and this Kate shared. And you thought Grimandi would have those answers. Well, as it turns out, he did. Evil little prick. Did you love him? What? Marcus. Did you love him? Of course, I bloody love him to bits. What kind of question is that? What are you smiling at? Nothing. Someone asked me if I love Cheryl, and I said, "Of course. To bits." So? But I didn't. Nor she me. He's left me. You must have known. - What? - He must have told you. - In the pub over a pint... - No, no. Men like him don't keep secrets from other men. If I've known he'd done something like that... What? If you had known, what? You would've told me? Well, yeah. - Don't lie to me. Do not lie. - Of course I'd have had told you. You were laughing at me. You and him and all his mates at work. You were all having a good old laugh. And what about this, this Kate? Did you know about that? Yes. You did? You knew? I was going to tell you. I wanted to. Jesus Christ, you as well. Soph, I didn't know what to do. You really were both having a good laugh. - How stupid am I? - That's not how it happened. - That's not what happened. - Have a laugh now. Go on. We could have a chat about who else Marcus is shagging. Will you stop this? Yeah. We can have a good cackle at good old Sophie. How...? Would you like that? Would you all bloody like that? I love you. - What? - I... I... I... Christ, I'm sorry. I think... You lied to me, and I think you should leave now. Please, just leave me alone. I need to talk to a woman. You stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, fucking stupid fucking stupid fucking fuck! Fuck. "I love you." You twat. Hairy-assed fucking twat! Ow! Fucking hell. Ow. Love is everything. The only reason... I say to you once. Look, love is the only significant event in the life of a human being. We must do anything. That is my obsession. Monsieur Jed, have you found love? Hey! That's my fucking bike! Hey, come back! Marcus! What are you doing here? - Jesus! - How could you do that? You just fucking hit me! - You fucked her up. Fucked me up too. - What the fuck are you talking about? No wonder you were weird about Grimandi. His lines. - The coffee, sepia. - What? We saw the film, Marcus! Soph and I, we saw Grimandi's film. Okay. I admit I got the idea from Grimandi, but that was just how we met. I loved Sophie. At least... At least I thought I did until Kate. I lied to Sophie about the suicide. I lied to you about not liking Grimandi, but this is true with me and Kate. - We're true. - True, like a French film true. No. Like the man says, true. If you haven't experienced love, then you haven't lived. Whatever it takes, Jed. Whatever it takes. I should have come clean, though. I wanted to. I should have done my research. - Well, you've always been lazy. - I've always been honest. No, you haven't. Well, I am now. I'll see you. Christ. - Soph, what... Why are you here? - I needed to see Kate. Why? I'm a woman. She's pretty. You think? I saw what you did. Oh, God, did you? I'm not much of a fighter, I'm afraid. Did you hit him for me? I'm so sorry about last night. - Me too. - Really? You were just trying to be kind. No, I wasn't. I meant it, Soph. I... Something happened for me. Something started. At that lunch, or at your birthday, or God, when we first met, I don't know when, but it happened. I'm sorry, Soph. Look, Jed, I... I'm gonna shut up. In fact, I'm gonna leave. Are you expecting a guest? No. Thank you. - Sophie. - I'm glad. For what? That you don't know when it started. When what started? This. When this started. So you think it has? I think there are other meetings other than suicides and prostitutes. Less dramatic. Like what? Like this. How about this? My doorstep? It might have to be dramatic enough. You know what I like best about France? Surprise me. Leaving it. Subtitles by LeapinLar He removed this face for a reason. I want to know what that was. I hadn't fully appreciated how well this has been done. You think they've done it before? Hm, not even a nick. Oh, my God, it's Fran Price. Fran Price presented a crime show. Leonid Polyak was a Russian gangster she helped put away with her show. You had her killed because you found out she was writing a book about you. I don't understand. Chapter One. All about how you set up a network in Russia that connected business and crime. I'm a final year medical student. A student? Is that a problem? Seems not. She was using opiates by injection, yes. I don't want it out there she may have been killed over a drug deal. This is going to be huge. Media, I mean. It doesn't concern us. We're in the middle of it. This has nothing to do with the press? Nothing has nothing to do with the press. There are things in the newspaper that have come from our office. I'm reading all about so-called breakthroughs in the case. Where did this stuff come from? It claims the police have some unspecified forensic evidence. But we didn't find any extra DNA. Now I feel stupid for having put so much trust in her. Strictly speaking, it should go to another team. No. Well, you shouldn't do it. I should do it. I was the least involved with her. OK. Come on, let's go. We are expecting the police any minute so let's get our paperwork ready. Oh, Jesus. Shouldn't we have a different SIO? Shouldn't we have a different pathologist? It's one case, in our opinion. We know that before the PM? The SOCO's are telling me there is a remarkable absence of what they call noise around the body. Specifically? Smudges, footprints, fibres. So the killer was wearing protective clothing? OK. We are all here. I think we're ready. This was our colleague and friend, but let's try to treat this as a case like any other, yeah? MUFFLED SCREAMING There are incised wounds... ..and burns on the upper torso. SCREAMING And cuts to the forearms, which are consistent with defence wounds. SHOUTING There are pressure marks on the throat... SCREAMING Damn you! ..and above the left eye orbit. There is a cut inside the left nasal passage. SCREAMING We're saying she was tortured? I'm just describing wounds. Cause of death appears to be a deep wound to the throat. This is the same thing as the Price girl. We're only doing one PM here. Have you looked at the cuts, can you say is it the same blade? The cuts are not inconsistent with... Oh, come on. Please! The cuts are not inconsistent with it being the same weapon. Can you photograph this, please? What is it? What have you got? It's the tip of a blade. It's the same man. Of course it's the same man. The shape's triangular. It's a Number 11 surgical scalpel, used for delicate dissection. The tip would easily break off if it encountered bone. Everybody OK? Not the same as a dissection, is it? Bit too much for some people. It was way better, it was great. Thank you. Good. A normal looking pair of lungs externally. Are you OK? Fine, it doesn't bother me. Are you religious? God, no. That's hedging your bets. Why, are you? What this shows me is that you get one chance and you better make the most of it. She inhaled blood... 'We're the doorkeepers. 'What? ' We're the people who stand closest to death's door. If anyone was to ever see through, it would be one of us. Ask someone to make Detective Superintendent Barker a cup of tea with sugar in it, will you? There we go, loads of sugar. We are now going to remove the pelvic organs. - Could you wait a moment, please, while I fetch him? - OK. Are you OK to come back in? OK. Go on, please. There were no obvious external signs of sexual assault, but we are now going to take a closer look at the pelvic organs. For Christ's sake! She was one of your team! Were you involved with her? Would you leave? No, I bloody well won't! I am the SIO! I don't care who you are. If you can't control yourself, then you'll have to leave. I'd like to apologise on behalf of Detective Superintendent Barker. Apology accepted. You can understand the strain and the shock, even for an experienced officer like Mr Barker. Understood. I'd better go and see him. Guys, could you give us a minute, please? And me? No, stay. One of our team has been targeted and tortured and murdered and I do not trust Detective Superintendent Barker as the SIO in the case. Janet, can you give us some idea where the police investigation has got to? Leonid Polyak, who's serving a life sentence for murder, was sent a photograph of a face the day after the murder of Fran Price. Why wasn't it shown to us? How did they identify it if we didn't see it? Detective Superintendent Barker believes Polyak commissioned Fran Price's murder for revenge, which... Anyway, I agree with him that the assassin was probably a Russian contract killer who stayed in the country after his companion led a trail to Moscow. And now he's murdered one of us! The story in the paper that seemed to suggest the police had forensic identification of the killer probably triggered the second attack. The killer needed to know if he was safe. So he risks identifying himself by carrying out a second murder? No, he's clearly a professional, which is why he had to know if he'd made a mistake. Could Holly have been identified because she had her photograph taken by the press? Possibly. I have something to tell you, I saw Barker visiting Holly's house. I went there to talk about leaking information to the press. When I left, I saw him arriving. Did he see you? I don't think so. I only went for the reason given. How did you know where she lived? From the night I took her out on call and dropped her off, and had a cup of coffee and left. What are you suggesting? That Barker was using Holly to leak information to the press. Shh. Leo, we have to talk about what we are... Not here, not now. Janet, I'm going to have to speak to the police about this photograph. Could you...? Harry, I've just done something I've never done before. What? I've concealed PM evidence from the police. What evidence? She'd had sex. Oh, God, I've never done this before. Why did you do it? I don't know. Not because you thought it was me, please? I did it because I was frightened. What are you frightened of? Barker? His DNA will be on the database. Oh, God, what's happening here? for good reason. Barker wants to speak to us. I didn't want him back in here so... The sooner that man is out of here, the better. This PM isn't finished, Leo. Meaning? It has to continue, after the police have left. I've fixed up close protection for the lot of you. Is that really necessary? Yes, you will have armed protection around the clock. Thank you, but... It's time I told you about our chief suspect, Leonid Polyak... We already know about your chief suspect. Why didn't you tell us he'd been sent a photograph of a face? Why weren't we shown the photograph? Did you need to know? Yes, we did need to know! I make the decisions on this case. May we see it now? Yes, you may. Each of these men is a close protection specialist. You will take their advice on each and every occasion they offer it. Do we get to pick? I'm a water sign. Sense of humour, very healthy. Defensive sarcasm, actually. Well, I'm sure that will come in very handy in a tight spot. Meanwhile, do as you're told. You think there's another target, don't you? It's possible. Why else would the killer stay in the country? I want to make one thing clear. No close protection in the cutting room. That's the first thing the boys asked us to make clear. No bodyguards around the bodies. Well, if you'll excuse us then. I assume this is for us? Leo... I thought you might want to talk? Oh, erm, no, we're... we're fine, really, but thanks. I can see why he didn't pass it on to us. Why? It doesn't add anything to our work. That's very generous of you, Leo, as always... I want to keep the temperature down, all right. So, why isn't this post-mortem complete? She'd had sex. Why didn't you say? She might have been sleeping with Barker. Ah. I want to have another look at the way Fran Price's face was removed. There's nothing to see, we removed the head. Think we may have missed something? It's the incisions. Do they follow the lines of a rhytidectomy? A facelift, and removed the scars. Yeah. Hello. I'm going to make that visit. Right, be careful. Don't worry. CAR ALARM BLEEPS Shouldn't you check underneath or something? I've done that. You drive. Are these minders in close protection or close surveillance? It would be extremely difficult to go over Barker's head. Let's give Harry the time he's asked for, let him talk to Derek Pargeter. That doesn't matter, just tell me where he is and I will go to him. Yes, we're all busy these days, aren't we, but I'm sure he can spare a few minutes. Thank you. The Hapsburg Hotel.

I'll try to be more flexible. Who were you last assigned to? The Prime Minister... Ah. ..of Qatar. Oh. You a soldier? I'm whatever they told you I was. Just through there. CHATTERING Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen, would you take your seats, please? Thank you, and we will begin. They are going to take some pictures. Yeah, all right, fellas, you've got it, thank you. That's enough. Mr Kovik will answer questions after he's read his statement. KOVIK CLEARS HIS THROAT Yeah, yeah. I am Oleg Kovik, businessman. Frances Price was my good friend and she has been brutally murdered. Today I am alive and I am here to tell you that my enemies in Russia have killed my friend, but I am their real target. I am saying this because the whole Russian community is in fear, but I want my countrymen to know Oleg Kovik is target of anti-democrats. I am seeking political asylum to stay in this country. Now, I know Kremlin will put out lies about me, Kovik the criminal and this and that, but this is smokescreen for new KGB, for criminals and the gangsters. Yes, please. The Russian government says you defrauded the state of valuable assets. I buy my shares in state auctions, legal privatisation, all citizens get shares. Which they sold for food because they were starving. It was free market, yes, like you have and like you wanted for Russia. I admire the values of the West. (Who is that man over there? ) INAUDIBLE Yeah? What do you say to the Russian government's charge that you made your first fortune smuggling narcotics out of Chechnya into Europe? More lies. That you were the main link between the Chechens, the Russian mafia and the Europeans? To destroy my reputation as someone who opposes Kremlin that denies free speech and democracy. I call on the British government for protection. That's it, thank you. Read the statement. Mr Kovik, are you prepared to name names? Excuse me? Who are you saying is responsible for the murder of Frances Price? Leonid Ivanovich Polyak. Um, this press briefing is closed. ALL SPEAK AT ONCE CAR TYRES SCREECH You're the pathologist, aren't you? What the hell was all that about? Which bit didn't you understand? I want to talk to you. On the street, after what just happened? I see you've got yourself a minder. Very prudent. Oleg has doubled his security. What exactly was Oleg's connection to Fran Price? Am I going to be asked to accompany you to the mortuary? She'd had cosmetic surgery. Who doesn't? Where did she go? Somewhere you won't get papped. Russia? Yes. She went to St Petersburg. Did that man help fix it up? He's a generous man. He knew Fran. You heard what he said. Anti-democratic forces in the Kremlin? You heard what he said. Stay safe. How did you know she'd had cosmetic surgery? I just realised if she'd had a facelift, any scars would have been removed with the face. I thought we were there for Comrade Kovik's press conference. I'd never heard of Comrade Kovik. Well, you have now. Hard left. Now! It's a dead end. Nowhere to go. Oh, Jesus. Pull over! Radar One, I have had contact. Over. Bike. Couldn't outrun it. What the hell is going on...? Copy that, Radar One. We're going back to your address. Back up. Now! Was that guy trying to kill me? If he had a weapon, I didn't get sight of it. Oh, you didn't get sight of it, very reassuring... Jesus Christ! It's OK, he's with us. Just give me a warning or something. Christ! Just keep away from the window. All right, all right. Just double check everything, yeah? I'll see to him. Be out in a minute. OK, we are secure. There's a man outside, yeah? All right. Have a drink. Treat yourself. You are secure, yeah? Harry? OK, OK. We're secure. OK. HARRY: She'd had cosmetic surgery in Russia. I think the man she opened her door to was someone from the clinic. I think the reason she was sitting in the chair was she thought he was gonna look at her scars. So the removal of the face also removed the scar tissue? He cut along the incision lines. Are we talking about a murdering plastic surgeon? I do not know what we are talking about. Motorcycle assassins, God knows. I've got two men on guard outside my door. Me too. Hell of a luxury. Watch out for motorcycles on the way home. And mopeds - they are lethal. PHONE RINGS Yep. I was only trying to give you something. Give me what? I've put it on secure website for you. I have just sent details and password to your personal e-mail. PHONE DISCONNECTS PHONE RINGS Yep? Come to this address. OK. I'll be in the cutting room. Barker is not our leaker. We are talking bodily fluids, yeah? And? And it's not Harry either. Thanks. I'm making the assumption no-one is going to try to kill you in this meeting. Oh, good? As a precaution, I'll be outside the door. They know I'm armed. What if they do decide to kill me, but think it's best not to warn you first? Here. I stick this in my assailant's ear, should I? No. Just click on it, it's an alarm direct to me. I will need that back. Yeah? Yeah. KNOCK AT DOOR Come in. Please... No, no, no - stop. I am Oleg Kovik. Please, sit. So who is this? This man is plastic surgeon in Russia. Akimovich... was honest man once maybe... He's the man who removed Frances Price's face? British police will not find this man. He's protected by Kremlin for sure. So Akimovich left London, my colleague was murdered by his accomplice... And now he wants to kill me. OK, but there's something I don't understand. There's many things. Leonid Polyak is not in the Kremlin, he's in a British prison. Correct. Please sit. Listen to me, huh? Kremlin uses gangsters. They want to kill me. How to kill me in UK? Who to use? Who has motive? Who has connections? Polyak. What does Polyak want? He wants revenge on poor Frances Price. So Kremlin and Polyak, they help each other out. Two victims, Price and Me. Why you? I own things. They order me to sell them. I decline. They kill the girl, remove her face. They ask me again, sell these things to them. What things? I own shares in gas and oil companies, pipelines across the Caucasus, owned by my bank. The state, they want this. They want power over former satellites. I speak here about freedom of whole countries, that is what is at stake here. But is maybe OK now. You can help. Truth is being concealed. Second girl knows this, is murdered, but now we will be OK because you and me, we are friends, yes? You work for me. No, I don't. Yes, look, I pay you. No, you don't pay me. Evidence will come out. What evidence? You're suggesting I plant evidence for you! Be calm, be calm. I'm calm... Be calm. I'm calm, OK. I'm calm. If you have evidence about the murders of Holly Farr and Fran Price... What? I go to police? Wonderful British police. Yeah? How you know what they conceal? Evidence destroyed, but you can make this right because you are pathologist. You can restore British reputation for justice, in your hands. What's this? It's the blood of Russian man who killed girls. Known associate of Leonid Ivanovich Polyak. Can we stop? What can you do when someone puts money into your bank account? Have a drink. £9,900... Ten grand they get reported. Money laundering regs. And yet he knows my account number, he knows my branch. Could we have a minute, please? OK... Once there, the Russian Mafia was able to target her, but they waited until she got back to the UK. You've been busy. Because a double deal had been done on her murder. Leonid Polyak promised to carry out two murders, the second target is an oligarch called Oleg Kovik. And the evidence for this? Almost none, but we could plant some if we wanted to. Mr Kovik has planted just under £10,000 in my current account as an inducement. He's trying to bribe you? Yes. And you said...? Oh, I said "yes," Leo. "Yes, bring it on." What do you think I said? Well, it sorts out your overdraft. Right, we need to get all this to the police. Who? Barker? The DNA profile didn't match Detective Superintendent Barker's. He didn't have sex with Holly. No? No. OK... No ,he just used her to leak information to the press about the crime scene claiming that the killer had left forensic evidence and got her tortured and murdered. Do you have proof? Harry... We had an agreement. That you were going to see Pargeter. I met someone else. We cannot conduct a parallel investigation to the police. We cannot trust Barker. It isn't his DNA! I saw him going to her house. We're not saying Barker's a nice guy or anything. Check it! There have been DNA mistakes before. How many Barkers do you think there are in the UK police? We've nothing to check it against. No? Frank, you haven't told Barker about the man on the motorbike, have you? No. Because you don't trust him? Because YOU don't trust him. My job is to protect you. If there's someone you don't trust, it's my job to pay attention to that. I think there could be a permanent post round here for you somewhere. What's that? You ordered tea for Barker, remember? Isn't that illegal? She was one of our team and we were responsible for her. Can I have a word? I've been looking at the evidence lists, both crime scenes. And? There was no desktop or laptop computer at Fran Price's house. She was a writer. She was a drug addict? Correct. Where's her works? Syringes, that kind of stuff? Then I see that there's no laptop at Holly Farr's address. Because it's there. But I saw a lap-top at her house yesterday. Maybe it wasn't hers. Harry... Leo the evidence list from Holly Farr's house does not include a lap-top. Well, should it? This one is hers, but I saw one there yesterday. Maybe it was Barker's... Harry... ..and he didn't want it to be taken in for examination. Why not? I don't know. But both sets of evidence lists are incomplete. Fran Price was an opiate addict who apparently had injected within hours of being murdered, but there's no trace of syringe or drugs or anything. What else is missing? Bloodstained pages... How many? The first chapter of her book about Leonic Polyak. So where's the rest of it? I want you to tell British government this is lies. They clearly have no evidence against you in the Price murder investigation. But what...? They're saying you may have corrupted prison officers, produced correspondence you'd had with Price. They didn't find it when they searched your cell. I was in prison in Moscow, remember? They realise that. And? They're talking about transferring you. HE SPEAKS RUSSIAN OK, we're fine. HE PANTS Hi. Hi. I need your help with something. Really? I thought you didn't want to see me again. That's not true. I didn't want to expose you to any more risk. Leo. It's not unreasonable, is it? Well, which risk is the one you're most anxious to avoid? SHE GASPS So what are we looking for? A hiding place. A stash has to be simple to get hold of. If you're high you're not going to be using a screwdriver or standing on a chair. Harry... Wait a sec... Russian. Show me. Tishina. Is there anything you can't do? Two years in the section at the Moscow embassy. What does it mean? "Silence". We need to see what's on these. My laptop's in the car. It's her book? It's her book. MOBILE RINGS Hi, Nikki. Barker did have sex with Holly. Thank you. Where are you? 'I'm gonna meet someone.' Fran Price had started a book on Leonid Polyak. Chapter One was printed out and recovered at the crime scene but nobody asked if she had finished it. Harry, listen... When I was in Africa... You know, sometimes you get hold of information 'you just shouldn't have. Information that's dangerous for you.' I knew people who were set up... 'reporters.' I'm not a reporter. Have you got this book? Yes, I have. I'm going to call you back. Fran Price must have been highly functional for a heroin addict. This city's full of highly functional heroin addicts. You got her a publishing deal... and introduced her to Kovik? They met. I happened to be there. Kovik offered help with her project. She'd asked me for contacts in the Russian community, OK? This is Leonid Polyak, isn't it? Yes. Did she tell you what she was putting in the book? It was about Polyak, how he made his money in Russia. Did you read it? She only finished one chapter. Couldn't get on with it. Went back to her bad old ways. I don't think so. I think she went back to her bad old ways because she discovered who Oleg Kovik really was. Oleg Nikolaevich is a businessman, pure and simple. Fran Price finished her book, Derek... and then she made the mistake of telling Oleg Kovik that she had finished it. Maybe under the influence. How do you know that? It's why he had her murdered. I just do PR. And you do it well. My relationship with my clients is purely business. BELL CHIMES IN DISTANCE Leave door! It's OK, don't worry. We're private. KNOCK AT DOOR Harry... What's exactly is this meeting about? Dr Cunningham. Hello. I'm Alan Douglas. How do you do. Mr Graham, my assistant. How do you do. He'll take notes. Please... The Home Office need agreement from the Prison Service on where to put you. I've told them in the clearest possible terms you don't want to be transferred. They say your wishes don't come into it. Now you concede that you took a DNA sample illegally? Because I had an supervising officer I believed to be corrupt or incompetent or both. And you thought the ends justified the means rather than going up the police chain of command. This girl Price, she writes to me. She wants my story. I write back I tell her I kill my attacker in self-defence. She wants to know who is behind the attack. There are a lot of things you haven't said. I leave Russia because I want to live. In Russia you cannot be finished until they have eaten your flesh. Cut off your face. When I leave Russia, I keep silent. That's what I tell this Price girl, silence. Silence. Silence is word for me. Do you know who killed Frances Price? Yes, of course. Do you have evidence? They never leave evidence. A name? Yes... I have name. The idea was that this man, Leonid Polyak, wanted Frances Price dead because she was writing a book about him that he didn't want published. but nobody ever asked whether she had finished it. Are you seeing someone? What? You're never home. And then when you are home, you're up in that damn darkroom. Come on, Norah. It's the free clinic. My patients need me. I need you. I miss you. You never touch me. I want another child. David. It's been six years. I know. I'm just not ready yet. - Every child deserves an education. - Order. Every child deserves an education. - Mrs. Gill. - My daughter is 6 years old. And, yes, it takes her more time, it's true, to learn new things. But she can do anything that every child her age can do. She can dress herself. She can recite the alphabet. She can count to 50 and... And yet, according to you she's not allowed to attend public school. - Mrs. Gill... - And she's not alone. - Every parent here has a child like her. - Your passion is admirable, Mrs. Gill. But the bottom line is, these are mongoloid... - We don't call them mongoloids! - They're not mongoloids. If we accede to your demands overnight we'd have a flood of retarded individuals. It's now called, Down syndrome. These children are not stupid. They can do everything that... But are they capable of mastering academic skills? Why not teach them a productive and useful trade? Phoebe is 6 years old. She doesn't need a trade. Order, please. Sit down, sit down. One at a time, please. One at a time. In you get, sweetie. There you go. So who put on your nightgown? Daddy. Daddy. Okay. So, what do you wanna hear tonight? Funny Bunny. Are you sure? All right. But if I forget something, you're gonna have to help me. Okay. Once there was a little bunny who was perfect in every way except she wasn't like every other bunny. And when she went for a walk the other bunnies would sometimes call her? - Funny Bunny. - Yeah. And how did that make her feel? - Sad. - Sad. - So, what did she do? - She went home to Mommy Bunny. She went home to Mommy Bunny. And Mommy Bunny took her in her paws and said: "Everything is different. No two flowers are the same, no two butterflies and no two bunnies. And that is why I love you." You're not my Funny Bunny. - You're my Honey Bunny. - Honey Bunny. You ready to go to sleep? Okay. Let's take your glasses off. Good girl. Okay. - How was tonight? - Oh, don't ask. How was Atlanta? Why don't you want him to know where we live? Because I'm afraid he'll take her back. Over my dead body. Come here. Come on. Come here. Let me show you some dance moves I was working on with Phoebe. - Only a little closer. - Oh, yeah? I've never done anything like this before. I'll have a lot more time on my hands once Paul starts the 1 st grade. Well, my husband's never at home, so... Well, he's a very busy doctor. Well, I only need someone part-time. But you're certainly pretty enough. I'm talking to another girl tomorrow. I'll let you know after the holiday. How's that? Well, I promise you won't regret it. Hi, Mom. Hi, baby. Isn't she the cutest? I keep telling her, I say, "Elizabeth, hon, you are the cutest thing." I hope it doesn't go to her head. Like a little tomato juice with your vodka? It's a party. You need to be a little more adventurous. - Like this. - Kay. If I had legs like yours, I would be living in miniskirts. Especially if I was married to David. He's so hot, I'm surprised you're not bowlegged. Kay. Let me see you goof around. Sort of like you're about to fall off. Hey, Mom, look at me. Look at me. Paul. You get down from there. Get down right now. He's a kid. He'll be fine. Don't encourage him, David. Stop taking pictures. - We're throwing a party. - Come on. - You can't just hide behind a camera. - Nobody minds. I do. It's rude. I organized everything, I made all the food. - The least you could do... - Help. Help. Paul, stop. Stop it. Get down this instant. Ease up, Norah. And put away the damn camera. I'm sorry I ever gave it to you. Maybe lighten up a little on the liquor, shall we? I can't stay up here. Stop. Oh, it's all right. You'll be fine. Are you all right? You look a little bruised. She's just on one of her things. I never know what sets her off. Kay. I told you I can't. Paul. Paul. Paul? Paul. - It really hurts. - Show me where. - Is it broken? - It could be. You said nothing would happen and he broke his arm. - Yeah. - It could've been his neck. - Well, it wasn't, was it? - Or his back. Just stop it, Norah, please. Just stop it. Just stop it, Norah, please. Just stop it. Stop it. Stop it. You're so good to me. How do I rate this? You're a wonderful husband and I'm a terrible nagging wife. No. Hey, where were you? There was a phone call. Something about a job? Did I get it? I got it? Did I? I got it? Oh, is it okay? I'll be a better mother, a perfect wife. Please. Well, sure. Whatever you want, yeah. What's in there? Is that where you keep your dirty pictures? That's just insurance papers. Hey, I'm almost done in here. Why don't you get ready for bed and I'll be right over? Okay. Don't be long. Like that. - Hold still. - It's hot. That's it. Wait. Here. That's good. There. Yeah. Yeah, like that. That's it. Yeah, like that. Wait. - That's it. - I don't get it. Why take a picture of me at all if you want me to disappear into the dunes? It's about perception, honey. About hiding things in plain sight. We're almost done. - That's a nice camera. - Thanks. You mind if I? - Oh, sure. - Thanks. - You a photographer? - Little bit. - Oh, that's a cool shot. - Yeah. Yeah, I use it a little bit in my work. - What work is that? - I'm an artist. - So you take pictures and then draw? - No, not exactly. I use a camera obscura. - I didn't think they still made those. - They don't. I made it myself. It's beautiful. - That's impressive. - Thank you. - My name's David, by the way. - Hi. - I'm Howard. - Nice to meet you. How long are you folks down here? Because I'd love to show it to you. We've got another week. Norah here, is the queen of travel agents. We're here because of all of her hard work. How about yourself? I'm gonna be here all summer. I'm kind of in the middle of a messy divorce. - That's too bad. - Yeah. Well, maybe you'll come with us to dinner? - Does that sound okay, hon? - Sure. Yeah. Come to dinner. Thank you. I've never seen anything like it. It started when Paul broke his arm. First it was the x-rays. And then I went into the operating theater with a telephoto lens. What do you think that is? - It's not a tree? - Well, actually, it's the human heart. - Here you go. - Thanks. That was amazing, Paul. You are amazing. Thanks. Got a lot of amazing talent in this house, David. Thank you. I can't wait to see what you do. It's a mahogany box that seals out all light except for a tiny pinpoint which focuses whatever image you're aimed at, onto a screen inside. - Right. - A lot of famous painters used it. - Vermeer. Da Vinci, perhaps. - Boy, I'd love to see that. Paul and I are going deep-sea fishing tomorrow. - But maybe the next day. - Sure, anytime. Though, I am in all tomorrow morning, Norah. Perhaps you'd like to come and see it. - Perhaps I could even draw you. - We'll see. Paul. Paul, wake up. Paul. It's time to go. Don't wake your mom. Well, you heard what he said, right? He said I was amazing. Which you are. I just don't think you should shut doors. Juilliard is opening doors, not closing them. - It's a dream. It's not reality. - You don't think I'm good enough? I don't think you can make a solid living as a musician. What if I'm the next Segovia? What if I have it in me...? What if you find the cure for an awful disease? - That is your dream, not mine. - That may be. But it's not something... You think music is less important than science? What do you know? You know what, screw you. You don't know a damn thing. - Paul. - Come on, move your damn car! - Move it! - Paul! - Come on. - Okay. Move it! Go. - Phoebe, sweetie, what is it? - Time for breakfast, Mom. Okay, we'll be right down. Why are you two so lazy today? - Well, should we tell her? - Tell me what? It's a surprise. We'll tell you over breakfast. Surprise. Oh, honey, that's so nice. Thank you, sweetie. Oh, sweetie. And you made me a card. Look. I did. I said, yes. Come here. - Yes, sweetheart. - Oh, thank you so much. - Well, will you be our flower girl? - Yeah. Oh, man. This place is so cool. He comes here when he doesn't wanna be with us which is pretty much all the time. - He took all these pictures? Most of them, yeah. He's such an ass. He wants my music to become a hobby like this. - He wants me to become a doctor. - Dude, that sucks. Is that your mom? - Yeah. - Nice. - What does she say? - She's got her own problems. I don't even know why they're still married. - Their marriage sucks. - Join the club. Did you do that? - Yeah, when I was a kid. - Who's "Feebee"? She's my twin sister. - She died when we were born. - Cool. Hey, hey, hey. Lighten up. What are you doing? Your dad will kill you. I don't care. Do you think I care? Screw him. Hi, Mom. - He wants to meet her. - What? The latest letter you brought me he says, what he did was a mistake and he wants to know where we live. What do you think? He wants to take her from us, Al. I doubt that. I can't risk it. Well, he'll have to get past me first. Come on, let's go to bed. Okay, buddy. Here we go. You are not getting any lighter. Dad? I'm sorry. I don't know what happened. I just kind of lost it. I can make it up. Just tell me what you want. Hold this. That's you and your sister, huh? June. How did she die again? She was born with a hole in her heart. It was just a matter of time. Oh, hello, yes. I'd like to speak to the congressman, please. My name's Caroline Gill. Yeah, it's about Down syndrome. - You know what they told us today? - What? Finally, you're allowed to attend public school. Great, just when you graduate. Great. - Outstanding work. - Thank you. Thank you, and my greatest thanks to Dr. Salter and the Winsley Gallery of Pittsburgh, for supporting my work. I'm a doctor. I understand science. But I'm afraid I'm fairly inarticulate when it comes to art. My son calls me, "a boring medical egghead." Which I no longer dispute. "In camera" means, more or less, "in secret." And I think photography does the exact opposite. I think it reveals what is hidden. But I look at these photographs and I have no idea where they came from. How can one live without theory? I see the passion but I don't see the point. - I don't know what I was thinking... - David? Have I changed that much? Do you two know each other? Yes, we do. Excuse us a moment. Good God, Caroline. You live here in Pittsburgh? I looked all over for you. Atlanta, Cleveland, all those places you had me send letters. My husband's a long-distance trucker. He'd pick them up and bring them back to me. You're married. Yes. And Phoebe? Is she still with you? Of course. I came to your apartment that day after the service. You'd already left. Were you coming to take her back? I don't know. I just wanted to see her. No. You just wanted to make sure that I wouldn't tell. All those years you sent nothing but little notes and lots of money. You never asked about her. Or me. Then out of the blue, I get some long rambling letter about how you want her back in your life. Did you really think that I was gonna let you take her away? - That was never my intention. - You didn't intend any of this? - Yes? - Dr. Henry, is everything okay? I'll be right out. Look, please, I don't have to tell her who I am. I wanna meet her. She's 18. - Why would I even let you near her? - I just wanna know if she's okay. - Is her health okay? - She's fine, her heart is fine. Which is not what you predicted. She's bright and happy, which is not what you predicted. She loves to sing. She's learning to weave. You missed a lot of heartache, David, but you also missed a lot of joy. Why did you even come here if you're not gonna let me see her? I don't know. I wanted you out of my head. It's over now. I was in love with you. What are you even saying? What did I ever do to encourage that? Nothing. Everything. I was wrong, I shouldn't have come here. Wait. Wait. Dr. Henry, I'd like you to meet one of our biggest patrons, a fan... - These past 40 years, he's... - I'm sorry, would you excuse me? Hi, this is the Lindstedt Detective Agency. No one's here now, but leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. My name is Dr. David Henry. I'd like to hire you to find someone, a woman who lives in Pittsburgh. There's a terrific cruise that leaves for Alaska mid-June so you'll be there during the solstice. I took it myself two years ago, and it was amazing. I'll be right with you. I can get you a cabin with a view and you won't believe... Mom? - Hello. - Hi, honey, it's me. I'm still in Pittsburgh. It's gonna take me a few more days. Is everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine. How about with you? Oh, I'm fine. Oh, God, I overslept. Bye. Paul. Hello. I told you not to call me here. - I have to see you again. - I can't, it's crazy today. - When's David get back? - I don't know. Sam, listen, I can't... - Norah? - Oh, God. Paul. Paul. Paul. Paul. Paul. Did you talk to him? No, but he's very nice. He took my picture. - Without asking? - He was on the other side of the street. Phoebe, how many times have I told you not to talk...? "Do not talk to strangers." I know, I didn't talk. You worry too much. Phoebe, we worry because there are people out there who would hurt you. You treat me like I'm a little girl. I'm a grownup now, I can look out for myself. Phoebe? Go away, go away. You're a bad man. I'm not supposed to talk to you. - Any word? - No. You call the police? The police won't do anything until he's been missing for 48 hours. - Did you call the school, his friends? - I'm not stupid. - Why did he do this? - I don't know, I told... One minute he's having breakfast, then he's storming out? He doesn't have his wallet, he doesn't have money. He won't get very far before he runs out of gas. - Maybe if you'd been here. - Oh, now it's my fault? I'm not talking about Pittsburgh. I'm talking about him. - I'm talking about "been here for him." - I've been here for him. We used to go fishing, play basketball. Come on. He hates basketball. He hasn't been fishing for years. You never supported what he wanted. He left because I wanted him to have a good education? - He wants to be a musician. - He's a teenager. They all want... I'm trying to give him everything I never had. - Yes, and he hates you for that. - He'll come around. No, he won't, we've lost him, okay? We've lost him, he's the only child we have and it's too damn late. And I need to go to the office. If you'll man the phones, I need the keys. Maybe if we go into counseling, as a family. It's too late for me too, David. It's too late. Hello. Dad? Are these really necessary? I mean, he's not a criminal. He stole some cheese. I was hungry. Paul, sweetie. Thank God you're safe. Is he going to jail? The supermarket where he shoplifted has agreed not to press charges. Fine, great. He's grounded. Mom, I have to rehearse. I have a concert in a week. You can't just do what you did and expect things to go on as usual. Oh, really? Okay, fine. Then I'm not going home. I'd rather go to jail, I'd rather be dead. - You don't mean that. - You wanna bet? I am sick of you. Miss. All right. Why? I applied to Juilliard without you knowing it. Duke drove me down to Chicago last month so I could audition. - And I got accepted. - Good. Good for you. I thought you'd be pissed. If it's what you want, go and be happy. I'm proud of you, son. Mom's got a boyfriend. I know. He's not the first, Dad. - You're not coming in? - I won't be long. - Where are you going? - No place you'd wanna come. Robert, Phoebe, that's enough. It's okay, Phoebe's my girlfriend. We love each other. You kiss someone you love. That's true, but that looked like more than kissing. Mom, we're getting married. What? No, you're not. Why not? Because it's complicated. - Where would you live? - Here. - Oh, Phoebe. - We'll buy a house. With what? How will you afford it? I have a job. So does Phoebe. We're gonna get married and have lots of babies. Babies are (RIMMER) Well done, Tom! Very good indeed. (HUTCHISON) What's the next move then, Michael? (RIMMER) At the moment, Tom, I've got my personal life to consider. - I'm thinking of getting married. - Oh, congratulations, Michael. - I think an MP needs a wife by his side. - Quite right. (NISS) Who is it? That... I'm not entirely sure of. Have you got the result of that poll yet? Yes. Queen, number one, as usual. She's out. Oh, yes. Number two.

Nice of you to come. My privilege, Prime Minister. - Make yourself comfortable. - Thank you. Tell me, Michael. Have you ever thought about going into politics? We're always on the lookout for fresh blood and there are one or two seats available. Well, I've never really thought of myself as a socialist. Can't see why that should be an impediment. We're not bound by dogma. Think it over. The offer's there. Thank you. Now then, my spies tell me – not literally, of course! (PRESSES RECORD) ...that your firm has been investigating the reasons for the slight decline in the popularity of my government. I'm afraid it's you, sir. But your polls have always shown me as being more popular than the government as a whole. Exactly. The public haven't been seeing enough of you. I mean, you haven't been on our TV screens for quite a while now. Well, I try to give the impression that we work as a team. But every team needs a leader. True. So you think a little more exposure on the silvery tube? The more the better! (BLACKET LAUGHS QUIETLY) (PRIME MINISTER, ON RADIO) Good evening, and hello again.

I rather like it like this. A great feeling of space. Care for a glass of 'Fors'? (BLACKET) Good morning! (GUARD) Nice to see you again so soon, sir. - You know the way, I imagine? - Oh, yes.

(HUTCHISON) I must say that Blacket idea's working out awfully well. (SPOT) Even our gardener's sick of him. I mean, he's never off the box! (RIMMER) I hope he doesn't die of over-exposure. (LAUGHTER) Such a ghastly little man! (RIMMER) He is a big help. You know what's going to decide the election? Law and order. That, and the race issue. I think we should be tougher with the immigrants. Well, I don't see how we can be any tougher than the Labour Party. We can't let in less than zero. (SPOT) We could let a few out. I mean, Uncle Eric's got this super idea about a boat race. Five thousand pounds for the first West Indian who can row back to Jamaica. When they all sort of row off, it'll be fantastic! - I mean... (SPOT'S AUNT) Spot. Your shot. Oh, my shot... Coming, Auntie Vanya! (RIMMER) As Sir Eric is retiring in any case why don't you allow him to express his real views? (HUTCHISON) The man's a lunatic! Good shot, Eric! (RIMMER) Exactly. He could make a grossly inflammatory speech – you could sack him and emerge as a man of principle, yet the impression would still get about that we are tougher on immigration than the Socialists. (RIMMER) Peter, I wonder if I could tear you away from my fiancée for a moment? Like you to call up a few newspapers... Nobody could accuse me of being a racialist... (SPOT LAUGHS) ...but when I hear stories as well-authenticated as this which I heard from a very close friend of a constituent who had been talking to somebody in a pub who had heard from an extremely reliable source that a fragile old lady of ninety-two had been locked in a lavatory by a group of ten immigrants who proceeded to poke at her with sharpened broomsticks for a period of fourteen hours whilst they chanted anti-white slogans, and finally forced her to use a newspaper photograph of Mr Enoch Powell in a way... that I'd rather not go into here. When I hear stories like that, I wonder – are we mad, to allow, in this country, fragile old ladies to be ruthlessly poked by blacks!

Are we mad? Are we? Have you read this filth? (INDIFFERENTLY) Yes, I have. Dreadful, quite dreadful. Dearie me. Oh, dear. What are you going to do? I can't be Home Secretary in a party that condones racialism. Don't you worry, Hugh. I will act – I will act. In fact, on matters of principle I am acting the whole time. Sir Eric is announcing his resignation this evening. Yes, Michael's taking his seat at the General Election. But that still gives the impression we're a lot of racialists! I admire your integrity, Hugh but you must realise we must win this election. (# HUTCHISON BEGINS TO PLAY LIGHT PIANO PIECE) And let's face it – this won't do us any harm at all. No harm. At all.

Incredibly randy. Yes, you must be... pretty fit. How's married life suiting you? How should I know? I've hardly seen him since the ceremony. What about all those lovely pictures of you together in the papers? That's about the only time we've been together – when there's a photographer around. (NISS) Yes. Yes, I must admit there is a calculating side to Michael that I find very... disturbing. But do you actually know anything about him? I mean, where does he come from? Never talks to me about it. Just tells me that he was found in the bulrushes. (PAT) You can't stand him, can you? No. Er, no, no, no – nothing like that. I just don't like to see what he's doing to you. What he's *not* doing to me... (COUNTRY SOUNDS) Good evening! Before you vote next week I'd like you to remember that basically, you know, friends, this election isn't about money and material things – it's about morality.

(HUTCHISON) I've been thinking about the composition of the Government... (HE GASPS AT THE COLDNESS OF THE WATER) ...and I was trying to work out where your many talents would bear most fruit. Well, as all my experience has been in financial matters I thought Chancellor of the Exchequer. (HUTCHISON) Oh, my dear Michael. You're not even an MP yet! (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I must say I admire your directness and drive but you must see that Mandeville must be in charge of the Exchequer. Of course, I've always believed that a man's personal life is his own affair. What do you mean? You haven't heard anything, then? No. What is there to hear? Well, I hate to spread gossip, and they're probably faked, in any case. What are faked? The photographs I was sent. Of Mandeville? ...And friends. But even if they're real, I don't see why they should affect his efficiency at the Exchequer. Do you have these, erm, photographs with you? Yes, I thought it better to hand them over to you and say no more about it. God knows where the negatives are. That's not Mandeville. The other way up, sir. Good God! The continental pig!

The first result should be coming in quite soon from Clitheroe. This is Hugh Wilting's seat and traditionally the first constituency to complete the counting. But first, with no results in, let's ask Peter Niss of Fairburn Polls, what he thinks of the situation. Well frankly, Steven, I think we've started the programme about an hour too early... (HENCH LAUGHS) Well, let's go over to Freddie Daring at Clitheroe, to see if there's any news yet. Well, these lads have a great reputation to maintain and they're absolutely determined to give us the first result! I've never seen such fast, hard counting, and I think we should have something to tell you in a few minutes. Well, thank you Freddie. And now let's take one more look at the state of the parties. Well, that's the position at the moment with no results in yet, and now perhaps we can get a reaction from New York. So over there now, by Early Bird, to Tom Stoddart. I am not your buddy. Neither am I your mother! Appalling people! Ah, yes, well – over here in New York we are all, as they say over here, 'dog-gone keen' to hear the first result... (HENCH) ... And so are we here in London. And we must go back up to Clitheroe as I think they may have something for us. Come in, Freddie. (HENCH) Freddie? Can you hear me? In that case, back to New York! Here in Stockholm, we are extremely excited... (HENCH) We don't want to talk to you at the moment, Doctor Luns – if we could talk to you later. We're going back to Clitheroe to get the first result. - Oh, but I want... (HENCH) Thank you, Doctor Luns, we'll come back to you in a moment. So over to Freddie Daring in Clitheroe for the first result! (HENCH) Hello, Freddie? - Hello, Freddie? (TOM STODDART) Over here in New York... (HENCH) Hello, Freddie? If we could just get Freddie... No, we don't have the result yet, but in the closing minutes these lads are going really berserk. George Winthrop, one of the most experienced counters, broke a finger just now – but he's carrying on. (DR LUNS) Hello, London! (HENCH) Well, thank you, Freddie. Well, still no results from Clitheroe. Peter Niss? In that case, let's rejoin our good friend Doctor Luns in Stockholm. Are you there, Doctor Luns? He has gone to the... He will be back. In that case, let's go over to Paris where Pierre Dubois is waiting. Bonsoir, Pierre! (WAITER) Bonsoir! (HENCH) Pierre Dubois, both candidates at Clitheroe are keen supporters of the Common Market. What's the French reaction to this phenomenon? Ecoutez, Monsieur. Je ne comprends rien et je m'en fou! Salut! Le service non compris. Comme d'habitude d'ailleurs! ...Well, I don't think we've located the right Pierre Dubois. But while we were talking to Paris we did get the first result – not from Clitheroe but from Beccles – and here it is. A Conservative gain of 17,000. Now let's see what swing that is. Over to Magnus Orbison on the swingometer. (HENCH) Peter Niss... Well, that's just under a twenty percent swing to the Conservatives. It's exactly what we predicted at Fairburn. If it's repeated it'll give the Conservatives an overall majority of, what, 265? Ah. Well now the results are coming in thick and fast. And here's an interesting result. Michael Rimmer has held Budleigh Moor for the Conservatives with a greatly increased majority. (# MAIN 'RIMMER' THEME) (MRS FERRET) He's in. I knew he'd do it! (FERRET) But only by 17,000. (HENCH) That's another Conservative gain. And so, with 435 results in, we have the news that the Prime Minister has conceded defeat. (TV EXPLODES) And now it's six-fifteen in the morning, there's only the Clitheroe result to come in. And here it is. After three recounts Hugh Wilting has retained his seat with a majority of only five. That's over 18,000 down from the last election, due no doubt to his courageous stand on the race issue. So now we leave Election Grandstand with a new Conservative Government in office. And it's thanks to all our experts, and good night. (FLOOR MANAGER) Right, that's it, studio. Wrap it up. (# CURRENT AFFAIRS THEME) (MUSIC ENDS) (ON MONITOR) Luns, here. Doctor Luns. Er, hello. Hello, London... This is Stockholm...

The Chancellor is bringing the exact figures but I do feel that unless we announce strong measures there is a grave danger of another run on the Pound. I wonder if you would excuse me a moment? I have a rather important call to make to my wife in Zurich... Gentlemen. I must ask you as patriots and ministers not to speculate against the Pound. (HUTCHISON) Michael. There you are! Sorry to keep you, Tom. I wanted to have all the figures. (HUTCHISON) Good. We've just been discussing the appalling mess we've been left by the Socialists. (HUTCHISON) We have inherited a mess, haven't we? - Oh yes, yes. Yes, we have. - Good, fine! In fact, overall, the financial situation could be described as disastrous. - Catastrophic! - 'Hopeless' is another good one. I think we're all agreed on the nature of the problem. Now, Michael. What are your proposals for dealing with this, er... crisis. Well, first of all I'd reduce Income Tax, reduce Purchase Tax, and increase the Old Age Pensions. You must be mad! Well, I think we ought to honour our pre-election pledges. (HUTCHISON) No, no, Michael. - Nobody expects that of us. - Hear, hear! No, the normal routine is to say that we are all staggered and horrified and then blame it all on the last lot! I mean, what are our gold reserves at the moment? - Two-and-a-half million. - God Almighty! No, seriously, Michael. What are your proposals? Well, I've been having a word with our friends in Paris and Bonn. I didn't know we had any friends in Paris and Bonn. And I think that while I'm sort of, sorting things out it would be best to sit back and do nothing for a couple of weeks. Good idea! Will all those in favour of sitting tight and doing nothing for two weeks, raise one arm? (LAUGHTER) (HUTCHISON) Carried unanimously! Thank you, gentlemen. That's all I want to say to you. - Goodbye, Prime Minister. - 'Bye, Michael. Oh, and I do think we should try and create the impression of some activity. What about a summit? That would pass the time. Very good indeed. And talk about things in terms of keeping our options open. (HUTCHISON) Right. (CHAIRMAN) Jolly good idea. Very good idea. No comment, gentlemen.

(SOLEMN TYMPANI NOTES) Tonight, the country lies stunned by the tragic news of the death of the Prime Minister. (BLACKET DISGUISES INVOLUNTARY LAUGHTER BY COUGHING) Messages of sympathy have been pouring in from all over the world. The Pope has condemned the senseless violence of our times. The President of the USA has spoken warmly of the man with whom he recently spent so much time. Here in the studio tonight we have three men who knew him well. First, the Home Secretary, Hugh Wilting, who was with him when he died. This is a black day... er, darkish sort of day for Britain. (HENCH) Your Grace... I think it ironic that a man who so loved the sea should be, so to speak, bitten by the mouth that drowned him. Was it St Paul, or Cole Porter who said we always hurt the one who loves us? But I'm sure this fine man has found solace in Heaven with Almighty God – if there is such a person. Mr Blacket. You, at times, have been on rather acrimonious terms with the late Prime Minister. We've had our differences. On one occasion – indeed, on several occasions – you described him as a 'two-faced, weasel-eyed git'. In the rough-and-tumble of parliamentary debate one often says things that are easily misinterpreted. But there was a great warmth between us. One hates to make, er, party points, but, erm Suffer little ones and let the little ones suffer. He giveth and taketh away, and casts his bread upon the waters.

(MRS FERRET) Hello? (DJ) Hello, Mrs Ferret? (MRS FERRET) That's right, Dave. But Constance to you. Great. Now what do you do, Constance? I'm just an ordinary housewife. Great. What does your husband work at? My husband, Dave? Oh, he's a failure. Fine. And as an ordinary housewife who would you choose to lead the Conservatives? (WITH ENTHUSIASM) Oh, Michael Rimmer, Dave! He's everything my husband isn't! Well, Constance, all I can say to that is... (VOICE OF SMALL CHILD) ...groovy, baby! (BUBBLING) He's ruthless, opportunistic, dishonest, shallow, evasive, and unprincipled. But I'm still not sure he'll make a good leader. I shouldn't wait up for me tonight, darling. I might be a bit late. - I want a divorce. - Divorce? Why? To put it in the only terms you'd understand... sexually speaking we're seventy percent below the national average. I shouldn't pay too much attention to one month's figures. Seasonal variations can be very misleading. I mean it, Michael. I want a divorce. That's normal. About forty-two percent of married women go through this phase during the first year of their marriage. How would it affect your chances of being Prime Minister if I went on television tonight and told everybody where the North Sea gold really came from? You wouldn't do that. (PAT) I'll ring Steven Hench now. No, you won't. Bye. (PAT) He'd love to get you! (RIMMER) Peter...? (NISS) Yes? (RIMMER) Pat's a bit upset. I wonder if you'd look after her. Don't let her near a telephone till I get back. - Right. (PAT CLATTERS AGAINST GLASS DOOR) I'd leave her in the bathroom to calm down if I were you. (PAT, SHOUTING) Let me out! Peter! - Hello? (PAT) Let me out! I'd love to. But I can't. Why not? You can't stand him! I know, but he's so nearly there. And there are so many things we can do together. (PAT) Think of all the things *we* would be able to do together! I thought you loved me... I do love you. (PAT) And I love you, Peter. And I love you, Pat. Well, let me out, then. (# MAIN 'RIMMER' THEME) - Thank you, sir. - Look this way, sir! Oh, don't do that. You'll bruise your lovely shoulders. (PAT) If you loved me you'd let me out! - But I do love you. (PAT) And I love you... so let me out, you stupid, spineless, sycophantic... (APPLAUSE) If you let me out you can have me! Darling Pat! (APPLAUSE FROM TV) May I say how proud and privileged I am to have been elected Leader of the Conservative Party. (APPLAUSE) I don't believe it. He's done it! So he has. Sorry darling, but duty calls. (RIMMER, ON TV) ...albeit it under circumstances which I most bitterly regret. This is not a time for false hopes. The situation is critical and I intend to take immediate action. (RIMMER) Hello, darling. Let's start improving our monthly figures... (RIMMER) Colonel Moffat, late of the Spofforths, is our new Minister of Defence. (APPLAUSE) Teddy Mandeville will be Minister of Labour. (APPLAUSE) Now happily recovered from his illness. I've chosen him because, above all, Teddy is a deeply human man. And nobody knows better than me how very human he can be. As public opinion polls have become such a vital part of our democratic way of life the time has come to take them out of private hands where they can possibly be misused. I've therefore created a National Poll Board under the chairmanship of Mr Peter Niss. (APPLAUSE) Now, you know that I've never sought power and now that I have power I want to share it with you. For it is you, the people of Britain, that have made this country great. From now on, I want to consult you directly. On every major issue there will be a referendum in which you can vote, so at last we can enjoy a real democracy. Goodnight. (# FORCEFUL MARCHING MUSIC) Oh, look. There's more coming. Isn't it nice! Makes me feel so important. We are important, Loretta. A vital cog. Hats off to Rimmer. (READS) "Should we keep a continuing military presence in Binwandi?" (MR SPIMM) Mmm. (MANDEVILLE) The whole country's gone mad. (BREAM) The public doesn't know anything about government. What does he think he's doing? (MANDEVILLE) He's off his head! Guilty! I've never seen anyone so guilty. Milo: Uh-oh. (Siren Blares) Shrift: Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Just as I thought, you again! Shrift: Guilty of sowing confusion. Upsetting the alphabet cart. Milo: Apple cart. Shrift: Correcting an officer. Breaking havoc. Mincing words. (Alarm Rings) And having a dog with an unauthorized alarm. (Tock Barks) Shrift: And illegal barking. Shrift: I sentence you both to six million years in prison. Milo: Six million years? But- but only a judge can sentence you! Shrift: Good point. (Magic Music). I sentence you both to six million years in prison. (Gavel Bangs) Shrift: Come along. I'll take you to the dungeon. Milo: But- but you can't. I mean- only a jailer can put you in prison. Shrift: Good point. (Magic Music). I am also the jailer. Come on, come on! Humbug: Keep your chin up, my boy. Maybe they'll take a million years off for good behavior. Bee: Be the "e" of good hope. H-O-P-E. (Somber Marching Music) Shrift: You'll find it quite pleasant down here. Milo: Isn't it a little dark? Shrift: Of course it's dark. Dungeons are always dark. If they weren't dark, they wouldn't be so unpleasant. Milo: But you said it would be pleasant down here. Which- Shrift: Precisely. Which (*Witch). You can always chat with a Which if you get lonely. Shrift: This is it, all the comforts of home. (Door Creaks/Slams) See you in six million years! Frightening Music Plays Which: Oh, there you are! How do you do? Milo: (hesistates) Hello. Which: Come in, come in, come in. Milo: You'd better be very careful, m'am. There's a witch around here somewhere. Which: Well, of course there is! I am she. Faintly Macabre, the not-so-wicked Which. There, you see? Official Which: Kingdom of Wisdom. Milo: Oh, a Which! Like the Whether Man. Which: Of course! The Whether Man is my brother. At least he used to be. I don't know whether he still is, I haven't seen him in years! Have a cookie. The question marks are delicious! Milo: What does a Which do? Which: Well, I used to help people choose which words to use- Which were the most proper and fitting words for any and all occasions. But when Rhyme and Reason were banished- Milo: Rhyme? And Reason? Which: Yes, Milo. When the two kings had their terrible quarrel- (Adventerous Music Begins) Which: When King Azaz insisted that words were far more important than numbers, and hence his kingdom was truly the greater, and when Mathemagician claimed that numbers were much more important than words, and therefore his kingdom was supreme, why then naturally, they asked the Princess of Sweet Rhyme, and the Princess of Pure Reason to settle the question. Milo: And what did they decide? What is the most important? Words or numbers? Which: The princesses decided that words and numbers are of equal value. Tock: In the cloak of knowledge, one is the warp and the other in the woof. Which: But you see Milo, this decision infuriated the two kings, and they banished the princesses to the Castle in the Air. (Dramatic Music Plays) And I was thrown into this dungeon. Tock: And that's why people don't seem to care anymore which words they use, as long as they use lots of 'em. Milo: And that's why there's no rhyme or reason around here, and everybody thinks he's so good! Hey! Maybe we can rescue them, and rescue you too Mrs. Faintly...in about six million years. Soldier L: Ah, there you are. Soldier M: Where have you been? Soldier N: Been looking all over for you. Soldier O: Royal banquet is about to begin. Soldier P: Soup's on. Milo: I still have to serve my sentence of six million years in prison. Soldier L: No time for sentences. Soldier M: No time for words. Soldier N: Condemn boy to hearty meal. Soldier O: Prisons are for the birds. Soldier P: Jailbirds. Soldier L: Mustn't keep Azaz waiting. Soldier M: Things get hungry, too. Soldier N: Royal banquet's just beginning. Soldier O: Just in time for royal stew. Soldier P: Chow (Ciao). Milo: Goodbye Mrs. Macabre, don't worry. I'll find a way to rescue you. (Cheerful Music) Tock: Bye, Faintly. We'll be back. (Glittery Tones Play As Which's Tears Fall) (Royal Trumpets Sound) Soldier: His Majesty, the Supreme Ruler of Semantics, Most Eminent Chieftain of Participles, Lord and Master of Words, Super Sovereign of Syntax, Chief Potentate of Adverbs and Prepositions. (Soldier P Whizzing to Grab Chair) King Azaz the Unabridged. Milo: If you please, sir. (Azaz Bristles At "Sir") Milo: Your majesty. My name is Milo, and this is Tock, my watchdog. And we've been sentenced to six million years for- Azaz: Ahhh! Six million? That's not a sentence, that's a number. It's against the law to mention numbers here in Dictionopolis. Words are the only things that matter. Milo: I'm sorry your kingship, sir. Azaz: After all, me boy- (Singing) You couldn't have one fine day without the "day," could you? You couldn't have tea for two without the "tea," could you? You couldn't have three blind mice, without the "mice," could you? So you see, Milo, words are really, very valuable things. If you think a great thought, how do you write it down? Words! If you spot a brush fire, how do you warn the town? Words! If you have opinions, how do you speak your piece? If you rent a castle, how do you read your lease? If you know a good joke, how do you tell a friend? Words, words! That's how. Words in a word are amazing. You can read 'em, you can write 'em, you can sing 'em, and recite 'em, underline them. Misdefine them. They're amazing! Words in a word are fantastic! You can hint 'em, you can say 'em, you can print 'em, you can pray 'em. Emphasize them and despise them. They're fantastic! String them into sentences and thoughts profound. We'll abound, in a symphony of spoken sound, truth is found, beauty crowned. In other words, words in a word are delicious! You can taste 'em, you can treat 'em, you can waste 'em, you can 'eat em. And digest them, I suggest them! They're delicious! (King Sighs) Words. (Music Ends Dramatically) Azaz: Speechers, speechers. Time for speeches. You my boy, as our guest, may speak first. Milo (clears throat): Your Majesty, uh Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity- Azaz (claps): Enough, next. Tock: Soup bones, dog biscuits, porter house steak, carpet slippers. Humbug: Roast turkey, mashed potatoes, vanilla ice cream. Soldier L: Veal Cutlet Parmesan. Soldier M: Eggplant Florentine. Soldier N: Eggs goldenrod. Soldier O: Jones sausage, "reosh." Azaz: Pate de foie gras, soupe a l'oignon, faisan sous cloche, salade endive, fromages et fruits et demi-tasse." (Servants Marching, Music in Rhythm with Chewing) Food (whispering): Your majesty, ladies and- Milo: But that's my speech! I didn't know I was going to have to eat my words. King (chewing): Of- of course you do. That's what we're all doing. (Chews). You, you, you should have made a tastier speech. (Gasps). I seem to have a touch of indigestion. Milo: Perhaps you've eaten too much too quickly. Azaz: Too be sure, too much, too quickly. I most certainly haven't eaten too little, too slowly. Or too much, too slowly. Or too little, too quickly. Or taken all day to eat nothing. Or eaten everything in no time at all. (Chair Creaks) Milo: But wouldn't that be just as bad? Azaz: You mean just as good. Things which are "just as bad" also are equally good. Try to look at the bright side of things, Milo. Milo: I don't know what side of anything to look at. Everything is so confusing! And all your words only make things worse. Azaz: How true. Words seem to have lost their meaning. Milo: But there must be something you can do about it. Couldn't you pass a law- or something? Azaz: We have almost as many laws as we have words, but the laws don't make any sense either. Milo: Perhaps you might allow - I mean uh, because you are a wise and -and righteous and just king, you might allow... Rhyme and- and Reason to return? Azaz: How nice that would be... No! No, no never! Not while that stubborn brother of mine... (*Gently) Things always did go very well when they were here. (*Gruffly) I won't allow it! Milo: Why not? Azaz: (Gently) Why not? (Gruffly) Why not, indeed! Azaz: (Gently) Yes. Why not? My boy, I cannot tell you how it would solve all our problems, if only you could bring back Rhyme and Reason. (Humbug Snores) Bee: Odious wasp, eh? (Bee Zooms) Bee: Didactic Drone? Bee: Parsimonious word miser, is it? Azaz: Perhaps someone else among my faithful court would volunteer to join this brave boy in his efforts to rescue Rhyme and Reason? (Music of Dismay Plays) Azaz: No volunteers? (Humbug Snores) Bee: Insectious Humbugious, ey? We'll see. Azaz: Wonderful! A volunteer! Congratulations. Milo: That's great! With the Humbug's help, I know we can do it! Azaz: Goodbye, my boy. Here, in this bag, are all the words and ideas I know. With them, you may ask all the questions which have never been answered. And answer all the questions which have never been asked. All the great books of the past, and all the ones yet to come, are in that bag. Go now. But remember, use these words well,and there is no obstacle you cannot overcome. Azaz: Goodbye. Milo/Tock: Goodbye! Milo: And thank you. Goodbye! Azaz: Goodbye! (Music Begins) (Adventurous Music Plays) Milo: Wow, what a mess! How will we ever get through that? (Music of Confidence) (Humbug Knocks/Kicks Wood)* Humbug: It is of no use my lad. The wall is absolutely impenetrable. However, your heroic effort shall not be unrewarded. Our eternal gratitude will be yours. Shall we start back? Milo: Now look here, Mr. Humbug. If you think for one minute that- Dodecahedron: I say young man, what seems to be your problem? Milo: Who are you? Dodecahedron: My angles are many, my sides are not few. I'm the Dodecahedron, and who are you? Milo: What's a dode-kaheadrun? Tock: As I remember it, it's a twelve-sided mathematical shape. Dodecahedron: See for yourself. I usually use one at a time... saves wear and tear. By the way, what was your problem? Milo: We have to get to Digitopolis to ask the Mathema- Dodecahedron: The only way to get there is through the Numbers Mine. Milo: Numbers Mine? But we can't get through there. The entrance is blocked tight. Tock: Milo, you remember how you got us out of the Doldrums? Milo: Yeah, maybe we can think our way through! Dodecahedron: Can you remember any mathematics? Milo: Let's see. Things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other. (Wood Cracking) Dodecahedron: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 is known as the- Milo: Fibonacci Series! (Wood Cracking) Dodecahedron: Vectors have both magnitude and directions... Milo: Scalars have only magnitude! (Door Crashes/Crashes on Ground) Milo: We did it, we did it! Humbug: (Laughs) Yes, yes. We handled that brilliantly, my boy. 'Tis a good thing we knew the Fibonacci Series, eh? (Laughs) Yes, ee-dee. (Pleasant Flute Music Plays) Milo: Golly. And I used to think numbers weren't important or valuable. Mathemagician: Not important? Not valuable? Humbug: It's- it's the Mathemagician. Mathemagician: By the 4,827, 659 hairs on my head, I'll tell you what's important. Mathemagician (singing): You couldn't have 1 fine day without the 1, could you? You couldn't have tea for 2 without the 2, could you? You couldn't have 3 blind mice without the 3, so you see? Numbers are the 4, 5, 6, 7, 8- Wonders of the World! If you had a big plan, how would you know how big? Numbers! If you had a high hope, how would you know how high? Numbers! If you had a deep bog, how would you know how deep? If you had a close call, how would you know how close? If you had a wide choice, how would you know how wide? Numbers! Numbers! That's how! Numbers can be decimated, verified, manipulated, carried forward, backward, and replaced. Numbers can be added to, subtracted from, divided into, multiplied by, crossed out, and erased. But not with words. You're stuck with words. Words are things you have to keep, have to watch, have to weigh, have to mind, have to know, have to say. (Singing) But it's amazing what a digit or two can do. Why anything you cannot figure out, they figure out for you. And when troubles mount and they become too much to bear. (Bag Drops Heavily) Never Fear. (Talking) Just divide them and divide them. And divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, until they disappear. Nothing counts like numbers. Numbers! Numbers, wonderful numbers! Those Dewey decimal dearies, square root and mix them in series, They give the heart inspiration, no words can bring such elation! 1 to 9, they're the most. Pour the wine, drink a toast to- Numbers! (Music Ends Dramatically) Mathemagician: Welcome to my workshop! Humbug: Very impressive, Your Majesty. But, could you show us the biggest number there is? Heh, heh. That will give him something to figure out. Mathemagician: Very well, Sir Humbug. What's the biggest number you can think of? Humbug: 9,999,999, 000,999 and 9/10. Mathemagician: Very good. Now add 1 to it. Humbug: Add 1? Mathemagician: Now add 1 to that. Add 1 again. Add 1 again. Add 1 again. Add 1 agai- Milo: But he'd never be able to stop that way. Mathemagician: Never. For the number you hope for is always at least one more than the one you have. And that's so large that if you start saying it yesterday, you wouldn't finish 'til tomorrow. I hope that's clear to you. Milo: Nothing's very clear to me. Here, or in Dictionopolis. Mathemagician: (Gruffly) Right! It's all the fault of that wretched brother of mine, King Azaz. (Gently) Ever since the little princesses left, nothing make sense. (Gruffly) And it's all his fault! Milo: (clears throat) If you please sir, we'd like to rescue Rhyme and Reason. Mathemagician: (Gruffly) Rescue Rhyme and Reason? ! (Gently) Rescue Rhyme and Reason? What a wonderful idea! (Gruffly) Wait, has Azaz agreed to it? Tock: Yes sir, he has. Mathemagician: Then I don't. We've never agreed on anything, and we never will. Milo: And if I can prove otherwise, can we have permission to go? Mathemagician: Of course, of course. Milo: Very well then. Now if Azaz agrees with something, then you disagree, correct? Mathemagician: Correct. Milo: And anything Azaz disagrees with, you agree, is that correct? Mathemagician: (blowing) Correct. Milo: Then each of you agrees that he will disagree with the other, right? Mathemagician: Right. Milo: Then you admit that you do agree with Azaz about something. You agree about disagreeing! (Surprised Music) Mathemagician: I've been tricked! (Music of Dismay Plays) Mathemagician: Again, I want to thank you for showing me how foolish and stupid I've been. But this gift can supply you with all the numbers, theorems, equations, and mathematical ideas the world has ever known, or ever will know. Use it well, and there is nothing it can't do for you. Milo: Thank you! Mathemagician: Goodbye and good luck. Milo: Goodbye. Mathemagician: Goodbye. Milo: Goodbye! (Violin/Tambourine Music Plays) Milo: Tock, look! Is that a demon? Humbug: Quick, let's go back! Tock: No, no, no. That's the man I told you about. That's Chroma the Great. The one sane man left in this country. Milo: You mean the one who conducts rainbows, and sunrises and sunsets and things? Tock: Right. We're lucky. It looks like he's ready to conduct today's sunset. Watch! (Birds/Bugs Chirping) (Conductor's Baton Raps on Music Stand) (Birds/Bugs Continue Chirping) (Mystical Music Plays) (Music/Chimes Correspond With Movement of Chroma's Fingers) (Pleasant Music Plays/Chimes Continue) Milo: That was a very beautiful sunset, sir. Chroma: Why, thank you my boy. I've only been practicing since the world began. Sometime, I'll get it just right. Milo: I thought it was perfect. Chroma: You ought to see my lightning, and fireworks! (Wand Chiming) Chroma: (Yawns) Well, good night my boy. Oh, don't forget to wake me at 5:23, for the sunrise. Oh. I really, really must get some sleep. Tock (loud whisper): Milo, Milo! Come on, we're wasting time. Milo (loud whisper): I can't! I have to wake Chroma for the sunrise. Humbug (loud whisper): Why don't you conduct the sunrise yourself, Milo? (Humbug Laughs Menacingly to Himself) Humbug (loud whisper): Save us a lot of time! And you won't have to disturb Chroma- at all! Milo: Hey, that's a great idea, I'll do it! Tock: Why, you fool! What did you tell him to do that for? Do you know what trouble he can- (Conductor's Baton Raps on Music Stand) Tock: No, Milo. No! (Pleasant Music Plays) (Frightening Music Begins) (Sounds of Explosions) (Thunder Clasps) (Siren-Like, Warped Music Begins) Tock (slow, warped voice): Oh no. (Warped Music Continues*) Tock: Come on, come on! We have to get out of here before Chroma wakes up. (Warped Time is a Gift Music Plays) Milo: Now there's no sense any place. And it's all my fault. (Warped Adventurous Music Plays) Senses Taker: Names? I must have your names before you can proceed. Milo: Well uh, this is the Humbug. Senses Taker: Humbug. Milo: This is Tock. Senses Taker: Tock. Milo: And my name is Milo. Now can we go? Senses Taker: Milo. Ooh... I haven't had an "M" in ages. Now then, if you'll just tell me: when you were born; where you were born; why you we born; how old you are; how old you were then; what grade you're in; Your shoe size; shirt size; collar size; hat size; and the names and bank references of six people who can verify this information- then you can go. Milo: What do you need all this for? We're in a hurry. Senses Taker: I'm the official Senses (*Census) Taker. I must have this information before I take your senses. So now, if you will fill out in triplicate: your height; your weight; how many ice cream cones you eat in a week; how many you don't eat in a week; Senses Taker: how many you would like- Milo: We can't waste the time. We've got to get to the Milo: Castle in the Air! (Thunder Roars) Senses Taker: That does it! Now I'm going to take your sense of duty, your sense of precaution, (Menancing Voice) and especially, your sense of direction. (Spinning Music Plays) Tock: Milo! The bottle of laughter! Use this bottle of laughter I got from Dr. Dischord. He can't take away our sense of humor! (Bottle Pops Open, Laughing Begins in Car) Senses Taker: (Gruffly) Stop That! Senses Taker: (Laughs) Stop that, stop that at - (Laughs) at- at once. (Laughing Continues) Senses Taker (Laughing): Stop...stop. Woooo! Heee! (Ominous, Adventurous Music Plays) Terrible Trivium: Hello, little boy. Milo (breathing heavily): Huh? Terrible Trivium: Welcome to you, your faithful dog, and that handsome gentleman. I'm so terribly happy to see all of you. But before you travel on, I wonder if you could spare me a little time, and assist me with a few trivial tasks. Humbug: Why of course! We're in no hurry. Tock (whispering): Don't do it, Milo. Milo: But Tock, we need all the friends we can get up here! Besides, it's only for a little while. Terrible Trivium: Now young man, if you will take those exquisite tweezers, and move this pile of sand from here to here. Milo: With these? ! Terrible Trivium: Of course. And you sir, have the privilege of taking this delicate needle and digging a hole through this cliff. Humbug: Why, thank you, sir! An exacting assignment, quite worthy of my talents. I shall enjoy it to no end. Tock (whispering): Don't be a fool, bug! I think this bird is the Terrible Tri- Terrible Trivium: And you sir, get to take this eyedropper, and empty that well. Milo: But these tasks don't seem very important. Terrible Trivium: Of course they're not important. If you always do the easy and useless jobs, you'll never have to worry about the important ones. Humbug: Right. Tock: Now I know who you are, you're the Terrible Trivium! Terrible Trivium: Quite correct. The Terrible Trivium, demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs. Ogre of wasted effort. Milo: Come on, Humbug! Let's get outta here! Terrible Trivium: And friend to lazy and foolish people everywhere. (Tock Barks Loudly, Terrible Trivium Boings Into Tree) Tock: Run Milo, Run! Intriguing Jazzy Music Plays Terrible Trivium: Come back, come back! There are so many things to take away, and things to bring back. Humbug: So many stamps to lick, so many pencils to sharpen. Terrible Trivium: There are so many holes to dig, Humbug: So many nails to straighten, Terrible Trivium: so many doodles to doodle. Humbug: so many goofs to off. Terrible Trivium: Come back! There are so many useless things yet to do. Humbug: There are strings to tie, nits to pick, fingernails to bite, paperclips to unbend- (Gasps) -Lives to save! Demon of Insincerity: Run, run, he's still after us. This way, this way, hurry. I'm your friend. Up here, quickly! I'll help ya! Good, good, straight ahead. Hurry! You're doing great. Tock: Yeow! (Loud Crash on Ground) Insincerity: Mwhahaha! Trapped ya, didn't I? I'm the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly haired, wide-mouthed, bowlegged, big-footed monster. And if I do say so myself, I'm one of the most dreaded fiends in the whole wide wilderness! Bwhahaha! Humbug: It sounds like we're doomed. Milo: "Sounds" is right.If there's one thing I've learned around here, it's that people aren't always what they say they are. Insincerity: With awful hideous me here, you wouldn't dare try to escape. Bwhahaha! Why I'll tear anyone apart that tries to get out of there. For I'm the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly-haired,wide-mouthed, thick-necked, broad-shouldered, roundbodied, short-armed, bowlegged, big-footed monster. One false move and I'll...(looks at Milo) I"ll.. I - I'll, I'll chew up the lot of ya. I'll rip ya to ribbons. I'll turn ya to hamburger, I'll - I'll, (Milo Taps Fingers and Whistles) (Discouraged) Actually, I'm the Demon of Insincerity. I don't mean what I say. I don't mean what I do. I - I'm just mean, I guess. Now you had to go and spoil everything! (Insincerity Cries Loudly) Humbug: Well, if he's typical of the monsters around here, we have nothing to worry about. (Dramatic Music Plays) Tock: It's the Gelatinous Giant! Gelatinous Giant (Booming Voice): And what have we here? Aha! I see! Breakfast. Milo: Wait! I have a better idea. Gelatinous Giant: An Idea? Ahh. If there is one thing I can't swallow, it's an idea. Milo: Well, it just so happens that I have a bag full of all the ideas in the world right here. Gelatinous Giant: No. No, no, no! Don't open it! Leave well enough alone. Don't take chances. Keep things as they are. (Voice Slows Down/Fades While Melting) Changes are so... frightening. No...new...ideas. Milo: Tock, Humbug, look! (Magical Music Plays) Milo: The Castle in the Air. At last, we've made it! We've made it! Humbug: Yahaha! Vic-tory! Haha! Victory at last. Tock: We've done it! Humbug: Perseverance Prevailed! Milo: No problems, clear sailing! (Monsters Growl in Background, Dramatic Music Plays) (Milo Screeches to a Halt) (Demons Breathe Heavily) Tock: The Demons of Ignorance. Demons: Down with the enemies of ignorance! There they are, get 'em! Tock: There's a Horrible Hopping Hindsight. And the Gorgons of Hate and Malice. There's the Threadbare Excuse. Humbug: (laughing nervously) Wha - Wha - What are we going to do now? Milo: Do? Why we're going to make a stand right here. (Menacing Music Plays) Humbug: I think jumping might be safer. Milo: King Azaz and the Mathemagician said there's nothing I can't do if I use words and numbers right. And I have a hunch if I use 'em together, that I can do anything. Now, who's first? Tock: There's the Hideous Two-Faced Hypocrite. Milo: Two-Faced Hypocrite. Hmm, let's see. V for victory over a Two-Faced Hypocrite. Now, if you take away the two faces, that leaves V/(h). (Bag Jingles) Forthright. This should be the answer. All we need is a 4. (4 Stretches, Dramatic, Fast-Paced Music Plays) (Loud Crash) Humbug: Well done, my boy. Well done. If there's one thing I can't abide, it's a hypocrite. Tock: Milo, quick! It's the Overbearing Know-it-all. Overbearing Know-it-all: You should have stayed home and minded your own business. You'll never listen to your betters.I tried to tell you, but oh no. (Snarles). Heh-heh, I'm always right about these things. Milo: I think I know just the word for him. Humility.

That'll be a great comfort to the orphans and the widows. 300,000 of us volunteered from a tiny country. Are we all fools? Who knows with Australian men?

You've been running the company well enough without me, mate. Alright, but keep it short. For a start, it details the shipping arrangements. It seems the AIF is priority Z. So the 1914 men are to go home first followed by the 1915s and so on, as shipping becomes available. So the old battalions will just fade away in dribs and drabs, eh?

"With complete disregard for his personal safety, "Lieutenant Flanagan..." Stop! It's the Victoria Cross. Martin. He's here. I tore... How the bloody hell? ! I tore that out! Easy, mate. Easy. He sent the top copy back by runner. Anyway, there were other witnesses. Two signals. Congrats from General Monash and arrangements for the investiture at Buckingham Palace. Not bad for an amateur, Flanagan. (Softly) Oh, God. ROLY: Way off the coast of WA, a few of the diggers reckoned they could smell the gum trees and wild flowers. It was a tradition among homeward-bound Aussies, like seeing who was the first to sight the Southern Cross. The question I most dread from the family is "What was it like?" I wouldn't know what to say. And not being able to talk means that us and our families will live with a four-year gap for the rest of our lives. It's not that Australia's changed, we have.

When he was wounded back in '17, I took a look at his diaries, and I think he has the knack. I left those with Pat. Martin Barrington thought so too. Do you know where my offices are, Mr Collins? Yes, sir. 10 o'clock Monday. (Clears throat) Yes, yes, yes. Look, the Government wants your full support on this repatriation bill. (TRUMPET PLAYS) Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, we are here today to commemorate... (SOMBRE MUSIC) We're here today to commemorate the fact that a significant proportion of the young men of this country chose to volunteer for a war some 12,000 miles away. It is also true that in spite of their numbers, they greatly affected the outcome of that war - affected it by the qualities they brought to it. Initiative, courage, mateship and humour. And in particular, we come to remember one battalion - the 8th - which suffered some 2,000 deaths in performance of its duties. The numbers in every small town in this country are equally horrendous. And only the future will determine what effect this will have on our young country. Of those who came through the ordeal, I can do no better than to repeat the words of our Prime Minister. "These men have crossed a gap "which none of us who were not there with them "can understand "and that they themselves can never retreat from." It has been widely acclaimed that the sacrifice of our boldest and finest is justified on the grounds that this has been a war to end wars. This, then, truly is the time for prayer both for the past and for the future. Almighty God blessed be the memory of the men from this district who gave their lives in the Great War. We humbly pray that the magnitude of their sacrifice will grant us that peace first promised us by Jesus Christ, your only son. We pray too for the survivors, their dependants and loved ones, who in the years to come will live with the memory of pain and suffering. And we ask that the wounds and scars of this great conflict be healed, not only here, but in every land so that the universal brotherhood of mankind will not remain forever a distant dream. We ask this, O Lord, for thy son, our saviour Jesus Christ's sake. Amen. ALL: Amen. Private Roly Collins will now read the ode. "They shall not grow old "as we that are left will grow old. "Age will not weary them or the years condemn. "At the going down of the sun... "...and in the morning... "...we will remember them." ALL: We will remember them. (POIGNANT MUSIC) (TRUMPET PLAYS 'THE LAST POST') (MILITARISTIC DRUMMING) (THEME MUSIC) (THEME MUSIC) (LIVELY MILITARY MUSIC) The 'ANZACS' is a television first in Australia. It will take 400,000 feet of film and nearly three years for the Burrowes Dixon Company to complete the series. The story will trace the lives of a group of soldiers in the 8th Battalion from the time they left Australia to the time the survivors returned home. It's a penetrating account of Australian soldiers in war. It will span five years of unforgettable history, 70 years after the event took place. Do any of you blokes know anything about music? Well, uh... (Clears throat) ...I've studied a little, sir. Good. You and your mate - shift that piano into the officer's mess. Get on your way! First lesson - never volunteer for anything. Well, 'ANZACS' is uniquely relevant to modern-day Australians for two reasons. It tells us so much of what we were, and indicates, therefore, what we have become. It is a story about ALL Australians, about ordinary Australians, called upon to do extraordinary things. This is the story of everyman, not the story of a couple of self-selecting heroes - those one or two people destined by history to perform great feats. This is the exact opposite. This is you and me. It's everyman. Performing under impossible odds, against... circumstances which should've driven sane men crazy. Ladies and gentlemen, Great Britain has declared war on Germany. MAN: Not before time either, Rupert. Australia, New Zealand and Canada have announced they will be raising forces immediately. NARRATOR: At the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, there were many who expected Australia to raise a ragtag and bobtailed army not fit for anything other than garrison duties. There's going to be a war! I will not have a Barrington skulking in the outback while the mother country's in peril! By 1918 the critics were either silent or openly expressing their amazement that such a small force could have had so dramatic an impact on the war in Europe. It had been said that Australians lacked discipline, and therefore could not make good soldiers. I don't need to be reminded that Australians are in France. There are already reports of theft, disorder. It's South Africa all over again. South Africa? Yes, the colonial hooligans. Lf, by discipline, they meant the outward trappings so beloved of European generals, then the critics were right. The volunteer Aussie was openly sceptical about things like saluting for the sake of it. He reserved this for people he respected. And that didn't include the major part of the British officer class. You two men - stand fast there! Don't you salute in your army? ! Not a lot. We used to, but we're trying to give it up. (COMICAL TUBA MUSIC) (GUNFIRE) Fire! They did have another sort of discipline which was far more effective - never let your mates down. Cover me! This meant that in the shock of battle, and shock is the right word applied to World War I, they stuck close together, and were hard to break. Other armies were just as courageous, but none had the degree of confidence and cohesion that comes from knowing that you can count on your mates. Bluey! Add one other thing. Leaders were selected from men who had already proved themselves, regardless of social background, for Australians would follow no other sort. Of course, the Anzacs never considered themselves anything other than civilians in uniform. The British High Command never understood the Australian attitude until 1918, when they started to, A - stop the Germans from winning the war, and B - won the decisive battle. And they only, at the last moment, realised that the best battle discipline on the whole of the Western Front was... were the Australians. These characters who created problems behind the lines, who, uh... were seen to, uh... not stamp up and down the place, and yet in battle they were totally cohesive. These qualities came directly from Australian society and marked the AIF as distinct among all other groups in Europe. At the end, when they had suffered the highest casualty rate of any British contingent, they were able to strike a series of blows which led to the collapse of the German Army. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (JOVIAL ACCORDION MUSIC) (Sings) Apres la guerre est finie Tous les soldats sont partis Estaminet avec vin ordinaire Apres la guerre... The casting of 'ANZACS' presented problems on two levels. First, to find a supply of young actors capable of carrying so many roles. To our joy, that proved easy. Second, and much more important, finding a cross-section of types capable of portraying all of the variety of the men of the 1 st AIF. Men as different as, for example, the character of Martin Barrington, the son of a western district squatter. Very upper-class. And then all the way to Roly Collins - urban, Catholic, working class - a boot mender. Probably the most difficult character, though, was that of the quintessential Australian larrikin. That one type of Australian that seems to represent to all of us what we would like to be. There is, of course, a type in existence - Paul Hogan. When John was writing 'ANZACS', he had Paul Hogan in mind for Pat Cleary, but in those early days, we didn't dare think that we could get him. Well, as events turned out, we did. And in landing Paul for the role of Pat Cleary, I think we breathed a truth into the characterisation of the first AIF that would have been rather appalling had we not achieved it. (Men shout) Bad luck for the kid, and Dale, he's a big winner. I'm not playing a German general, I'm playing Pat Cleary, and he's a typical Aussie larrikin. He's the kinda bloke that organised the two-up and the chook raffles and the sly grog. And got supplies to the front that the blokes couldn't get through the normal channels, and never treated the war seriously at any stage. Therefore, he's an important character because all those World War I diggers, and II, and Vietnam, and anywhere else, weren't all serious, dedicated, kill-or-be-killed soldiers. Who said it then? I dunno. Someone behind me somewhere. Who gave you permission to speak? You did. You said, "What did he say?" Silence! And it was that attitude that carried them through a lot of unbelievable conditions. They refused to take it seriously, and the Pat Clearys of that era were the ones that made the Australians different to the rest of the troops of the Empire. And they stamped the Aussie digger on, you know, world warfare anyway, and on Europe, as a unique sort of character. Loot! Here! Loot? No, we're minding it for General Haig. See, his name's on the bottle. How you say? Bull! (MILITARY MARCHING DRUM PLAYS) One of the first departments to be employed on a television series is the art department. They are responsible for the look of the series. For the research, we spent lots of time in the War Memorial in Canberra. All of the art department, wardrobe and costume people went down there, went there for a fortnight. And I think we looked at about 100,000 various stills down there to find various points we were looking for. For example, a field phone, a French village - before and after a barrage of artillery. So we bought lots of those back, then pieced them all together to give us a basic idea of what we needed. (MARCHING MUSIC) A battlefield resembles nothing so much as a garbage dump. So the art department raided the local tips to collect a fascinating pile of junk. As the Great War was the first motorised war, it was necessary to reconstruct a fleet of vintage cars and trucks from the ground up. One of these trucks actually made its appearance on the Somme in 1916. More and more, the countryside began to resemble parts of France. A group of farmhouses received the final touch of instant ageing. This is called 'dressing the battlefield'. The art department became experts in selecting the right piece of debris. Likewise, the iron men of the construction department. And so the fields of despair were built up. This is a reconstruction of the area around Passchendaele in Flanders after the winter rains had set in, in 1917. 500,000 British and dominion troops fell in the great push, only to be denied victory as the battlefield reverted to the swamp it had once been. (TENSE MUSIC) Well, it's my opinion that by a number of circumstances - some accidental, some perhaps intellectual, fashionably intellectual - that we've been robbed of a large part of our heritage. Uh, every nation could be proud of what the first AIF did. In fact, it is a saga. A saga that deserves the status of a legend in anybody's history. Yet, who knows about it in Australia? It somehow got lost in the '30s with the war weariness. There were other factors - the diggers themselves never talked about France. But I do blame historians, school teachers, for robbing us. I think... it's a strong word, but I say robbing us of this heritage. It is hard to avoid superlatives when looking at the 1 st AIF. Marshall Foch certainly didn't. FOCH: Although our task was never easy, it was made less difficult by the patriotism and passionate valour of the Australians, which serve as an example to the whole world. You saved Amiens. You saved France. When I saw the battlefield, um... several things struck me. Above all, what I realised was that I'd carried an Australian sense of distance to the battlefields. That to us, driving 100, 200, 300 kilometres is just nothing. And what struck me, driving out of Amiens towards Villers-Bretonneux was... just how short that distance was. It was... only a few kilometres, and I suddenly realised that, in fact, how many people had died but yet, what a very, very small area, um, the whole war occurred in. Kate, in amongst the shambles of that retreat, were some men who hadn't lost their self respect. Men who were looking for someone to focus their courage. Now, what? Would you expect me to walk out on that? Bloody hell. There's gonna be more unprincipled men left alive at the end of this war than the other kind. So? So why should my man be one of? Oh, yours, huh? Yes. Mine. (LIVELY MILITARY MUSIC) NARRATOR: Someone once said that war was nine-tenths boredom and one-tenth sheer fright. Well, film making is a bit like that. Except that, mercifully, the fright is mostly replaced by intense activity. There are long periods when setting up takes place - when everything, people and objects, all have to be in the right spot. In 'ANZACS', we rarely shot with only one camera. Our record was nine. So here we are on a nice summer's day in July 1916. The boys, in high spirits, are about to leave their friendly village to march south to the Somme, where fate awaits them. In 1984, however, Murphy's law prevails. A horse rears from the noise of our melodic troops. The animal is quickly soothed by our producer, and the scene continues. (Soldiers sing) Who's the little girlie by your side? I've seen you with a girl or two... So much of 'ANZACS' involves not just simply the battles. In fact, I suppose that one could say that no more than 10% of each episode concerns a particular battle. What it is more about is the men, and the women behind the men, in France, in England, and at home here in Australia. We see their friends and relatives, their wives and lovers. We're concerned to know what motivates the men, what they have left, and what, hopefully, they will come home to. And we need to know also what sacrifices were made at home by people left behind. How can they bear it? They depend upon one another. They have a fierce brotherhood in which each sustains the other. It's something approaching the Christian ideal. Ironical, isn't it, that war should produce that? (SNAPPY OLD-TIME MUSIC) (Soldiers sing) Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous? Mademoiselle from Armentieres Parlez-vous? Mademoiselle from Armentieres She hasn't been kissed for 40 years Inky-dinky, parlez-vous? Is this number four section? It was till you got here. No, I was a real McCoy soldier. I never fired a shot in anger. I was on, like, third line reserves to go to Vietnam, so I know all about... well, not all about, but I'm an old digger, myself. I'm in sympathy, and, uh... and that was useful in this series, because I was never a stranger to the weapons or the uniform, or the discipline, or the boredom, which goes on with the army, except when you're being shot at. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! They're Australians! Bullshit. I cannot just stand by while Haig presents another butcher's bill! NARRATOR: It is a cruel and wasteful business. The diggers knew that at first hand. But they also knew it had to be fought. But on conditions. Such as? That each step of the offensive be a success before he can go on. (TENSE MUSIC) "They died in vain," cried the intellectuals from their studies after the war. In fact, they're still saying it. Commonsense is often a quality lost in the process of higher education and the commonsense of the average digger told him clearly he was defending a society quite different to the one the German generals had in mind. (Whispers) You disgraceful woman! You know Martin would've done anything for Dick. Anything. And where do you think Martin is now? In some safe place behind the lines? (PIANO PLAYS) The variety of music in 'ANZACS' was quite amazing. Things ranging from ballroom music and sort of Australian country aristocracy, if you like, to elegant dinner parties involved, to English clubs. To, uh... Gallipoli, where you've got lots of I've tried to add quite a few Turkish overtones, which sort of tell you roughly where you are, to obvious war themes. There's three different love themes, there's three romantic interests. A hell of a range. In creating the music, it comes from different areas. I tend to try and go on location a lot, talk to actors, actresses, as far as how they feel about a character, which helps me as far as putting their musical feeling into perspective. Obviously looking at the pictures are the most inspiring, because you have something to work with, as far as sight and sound and feeling of how the scene is... is meant to go. It's then up to you as a composer to try and work out how you can enhance it, or how, if necessary, sometimes you may want to completely change the direction of the scene, musically. (Sings) I wore a tunic A dirty khaki tunic And you wore your civvy clothes We fought and bled at Loos while you were on the booze Booze that no-one here knows You were out with the wenches while we were in the trenches... WOMAN: Mademoiselle Fifi, Mademoiselle Colette, et Mademoiselle Claudine. While we were attacking up along the Pozieres Road. (CROWD CHEERS) Are they all for me, Pat? Yeah, happy birthday, Pud. (Chuckles) (SEDUCTIVE MUSIC) G'day. Well, the main difference between 'ANZACS' and most mini-series that I've done is it's just enormous. The fact that there's a huge cast and crew - double unit for most of the 15 weeks. It just meant transporting people and recreating the First World War is not easy through special effects - it's just enormous. Being a film about the First World War, of course, there was quite a few battles in there ranging from as many as 800 people in one scene, storming across a hill to where a battle had taken place, and following it on five miles ahead were, of course, hard. We covered areas of trench warfare, as in Lone Pine, where the Australians stormed Lone Pine, only to find Turks looking up at them. And they took that Lone Pine. It was one of the greatest military achievements of the time. We did sections like Lone Pine too in the mud, and that was extremely difficult, because you always had a lot of people to control and a lot of special effects, 'cause of the bombs and things. And placing those was very hard. (PENNY WHISTLE MELOD Y PLAYS) Quick! We're going to run in here! Come on! Two section - how many here? ! Got heaps of your boys - they're over this side. AMENTA: The hours that we worked were very long, so it required a lot of discipline from the cast and crew. When you're putting in 12 to 14 hours a day in the rain and the mud, you all have to keep together. Of course, there's three directors doing it, and the crew had to adjust for each director. (MILITARY MUSIC) BURROWES: The story of 'ANZACS', insofar as Gallipoli is concerned, is easily understood. It was a small, contained campaign involving a pretty insignificant number of people, compared to the Western Front. I think it's almost a national laziness that enables us to deal with Gallipoli. But the Western Front is altogether different. (EXPLOSIONS, TENSE MUSIC) (DISTANT EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE) How are we gonna go in this? I don't know. Not a gang of Abduls, Flanagan. It's the bloody German Army out there. I don't see how they can be better than Johnny Turks. Course they bloody are. This line hasn't advanced in a year and a half. BURROWES: The battles in France and Belgium involved millions and millions of men - armies from all over the world, professional armies. The Australians had only 300,000 over there, yet they were as significant as any other national force in forcing the final victory. But the path to that victory has defied historians, pretty well of all nations. NARRATOR: By the time the Anzacs arrived there in 1916, millions of men were entrenched from the North Sea to the Swiss border, and the enemies faced each other across a narrow gap called no-man's-land. Not short of guns here, Sarge. The side who could work out how to cross this space, then break through, would win the war. This war is in the balance. The Federal Cabinet have been told by London that if the reinforcement rate is not stepped up they may have to disband one of our divisions. Perhaps instead they should think about conserving our soldiers. Spoken like an armchair strategist. Rupert! No! My knowledge of the casualties comes painfully, at first hand. Anyway, what are we arguing about? This war changes a lot of things. A couple of questions, Sir Douglas. From the map, the Pozieres position looks less than a mile wide. The concentration of artillery in that small space must be very heavy indeed. Perhaps the heaviest of the war. And our casualties must inevitably reflect this. In 1916, the British threw 500,000 partly trained men against the Germans on the Somme into a storm of artillery fire not equalled since. In a narrow space of a few miles, battalions were pulverised by a million shells, and the gain was only two or three miles. It is all too possible that we may lose this war. The Germans have broken through on two fronts now. Breakthrough, you say? The German generals had planned for 30 years to knock out France with a sweep through Belgium to Paris. They almost succeeded. But they had overlooked the development of modern weapons - the magazine rifle, the machine gun and the high explosive shell. These weapons gave enormous power to the defenders. That, gentlemen, is why there's a continuous trench from the North Sea to the Swiss border. As long as the machine gun's intact, neither side can cross no-man's-land. Our enemy, the German Army, is extremely skilful in their use of it. Their gunners are hand-picked. And they use them like this. (GENTLE MUSIC) Mmm. Yes, please. (Laughs) All in good time. (Chuckles) No, not that. I mean a cigarette. Smoking? Sister Baker, you are a loose, loose woman. (Laughs) Aren't you the lucky one, then? (Laughs) So how long's this been going on for? Oh, since you seduced me. In the 'ANZACS', the basic weapons were the Mauser rifle, the Lee Enfield rifle, uh, belonging to the two major warring factions, plus their associated machine guns. Uh, on set at any one time we probably had 300 Lee Enfields, 45 Mauser rifles, some 8 machine guns, a dozen pistols, all of which were firing. The major problem, of course, was keeping them clean, functioning, had to go any time for any scene. Unload. Basically, with the machine guns, there was no difference whether they were regular soldiers or actors. They still needed instruction. The regs are just not used to those type of weapons. They handle the latest ones fine. The working action of the Maxims, the Lewis guns, had to be explained. They know the basics, they've got the best grounding, but just that little bit of work was required. (Cries softly) And I was so close. If only I'd looked around. No, no. No, I've seen as much death as you have. It did change a lot for women, the war, because for the first time they were asked to go to the battlefields to actually work with the soldiers. And they were about, you know, at times, 20 miles away from the guns and the fighting. So that put a large responsibility on the women to be a lot tougher. Nothing's gonna be the same after all this. May as well face up to it now. MEGAN WILLIAMS: Well, I think the biggest challenge in playing Kate was the fact that... I mean, I'm not a 1914 woman, and she had to be, and yet she had to be stronger than most 1914 ladies really were to make her a viable character for us. And that was the challenge - keeping her in period but keeping her much stronger than possibly somebody would have been in that time. (TENDER MUSIC) Uh, it goes on the left hand. Oh! Damn you, Martin. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Not here, not... Luv, the war's almost over. Another push, the Germans will be... Shh. (LIVELY MUSIC AND APPLAUSE) SONG: How you gonna keep 'em down on the farm? After they've seen Paree? How you gonna keep 'em away from Broadway? Jazzin' around and painting' the town... Hey! Pat! Oh! PAUL HOGAN: The biggest impression I got is there's not enough of a legend of the Anzacs. All we ever heard about World War I was Gallipoli. That's all we've ever made films on and all you learnt about at school, and that's where the boys got beat. There's another four years of the war after that where the true Anzac legend was born. Bloody counterattack. (Shouts) Forward at the double! The filming of 'ANZACS' presented special effects problems both old and new. Uh, the old ones - producing large numbers of explosions close to actors, a lot of actors, a lot of extras. Sometimes as many as 300 people on the set, plus crew, plus observers coming in from time to time. Lots of people on set who weren't familiar with explosions and with working near them. This required an approach that, uh, would ensure safety without slowing down the filming of the project. We were filming 10 hours of war for television in the amount of time that would normally be taken for about 90 minutes of feature film. And therefore we had to work fast and efficiently and still take no chances with people's safety. The biggest challenge for me was becoming a soldier for the series. But luckily, before the shooting commenced we had a two-week workshop period which was basically a military reorientation exercise so that all the actors could become familiar with the weapons involved, military etiquette, how to give and take an order, battle formations, etc. And also we were given lectures on how specific battle scenes that the series deals with were staged both geographically and strategically. So I was very lucky, as all the actors were, to have that period to become adjusted to the life of a soldier. MAN: Spread out! (GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS) Keep the line! (MILITARY PARADE MUSIC) NARRATOR: In 1917, the British went over to the attack again, this time in Ypres. It became another murderous artillery battle, and just when it seemed to bog down, the Anzacs' divisions went in and won a series of brilliant victories. The Germans, it seemed, were at the end of their tether. But it was too late in the season. The rains came down and the whole area, churned up by shellfire, reverted to the bog it had once been. Men drowned in flooded shell holes. I have a lot of empathy now with what those guys went through. I never really thought about it before. I've never done World War I history. But now... We only went through a minor amount of the action that those guys went through, and we had blankets to wrap around ourselves after each take, whereas those guys had to stay out in the cold and the mud and the crap. I don't know how they did it. I don't know how those men survived. I don't know a damn thing about you anymore. How can you say that? Well... when I came here you didn't kiss me. You didn't even say hello. That's for after the war. We've got to finish it first. Why 'we'? You mean 'you', personally. Maybe I do. I mean... Just like me. Go to hell, Marty. Mrs Baker, you can't do that! Can't do what? Well, put temptation in the way of our fine young men. Temptation? Strong liquor's an evil thing. It destroys homes and families. You wowsers give me the willies. Who are we sending all this stuff to? A bunch of fighting men or a pack of lily-livered bloody sissies? (LIVELY MUSIC) SONG: Hello, hello Who's your lady friend? Who's the little girlie by your side? I've seen you with a girl or two Oh, oh, oh, I am surprised at you Hello, hello Stop your little games Don't you think your ways you ought to mend? It isn't the girl I saw you with at Brighton Who, who, who's your lady friend? My job as stunt co-ordinator on this series was to break down the... break down the scenes that required the action, put the right bodies in there who could do the action, look after the artists at all times to make sure they were comfortable and safe when they were hurling themselves from trench holes from trenches to shell holes, etc, and across the barbed wire. Make sure that the whole shoot worked safely, the action worked convincingly. It has to look realistic. Even though it's a fantasy, it still has to look realistic, because the public buy realism. And basically my position was to put this action onto the screen with the director. When training stuntmen and SAPs - these are stunt action personnel who are apprentice stuntmen - one has to get involved with them and show them how it is done. They have to act, especially when it comes to hand-to-hand fighting or using props, i.e. Rifles or missiles, anything like this. They've got to know how to, as we say in the business, wear them. So if I was to hit anybody with a prop, with an instrument, they have to know how to sell it. And it's showing them how to sell it. And with new people, when you teach them stuntwork, you get an experienced stuntman to get stuck into, say, myself with fists and boots. You sell it and then look at their faces. NARRATOR: In 1918, the Germans were able to bring back their army from the Russian front following the Revolution. These fresh troops faced a French Army slowly recovering and a British Army bled white at Ypres. The Germans saw their chance and took it. They struck on the Somme, where tired divisions were resting. The British front lines disappeared under a storm of shells, and the German storm troops skilfully worked their way to the rear. The front trembled and broke up. The Germans were heading for Amiens and victory. The odds have swung dangerously in Germany's favour. It's obvious they intend to go for a knockout blow at an early date. I trust that whatever the future holds we will both be able to say we did all in our power to guard against a catastrophe. In the wild emergencies of the German offensive in March and April 1918, when the Germans came within an ace of winning the war, the five Australian divisions, which consisted of only 10% of the British forces, held over 30% of the line. And they stabilised it, particularly at a place called Hazebrouck - who's heard of that? - and a place called Villers-Bretonneux. Some people have heard of that. And they stopped the Germans winning the war. The war had yet to be won, but that was another story. NARRATOR: Australians marched up through a broken army and roads clogged with refugees. On seeing them, many of the French civilians turned around and went home, for they remembered les Australiens from 1916. We do not worry now. It is safe to go home. The diggers met the German spearhead in open country near the village of Villers-Bretonneux. In a series of swirling engagements the enemy was stopped and then sent reeling. The crisis of the war was over. France was saved. Then, at last, the Australian divisions were grouped together under the command of General Monash. Monash was described by a British historian as "a first-class general in charge of first-class troops". From today, the five Australian divisions will be grouped into one army corps with an Australian commander. This has taken nearly four years to achieve. From now on, we fight side by side. NARRATOR: The combination was irresistible. He struck first at Hamel, and broke a German division in 90 minutes. Then, a month later, with the whole corps, he repeated the exercise at Amiens. Monash combined, as no other, his men, planes, tanks and guns with the aim of both winning, and conserving soldiers. Amiens was the greatest victory of that war. The Australians and their Canadian neighbours broke through for five miles on the first day. The beleaguered Allies took heart at this stunning turn in the fortunes of war. A general advance began and the Germans sued for peace in October. DIX ON: It was said by the Germans themselves that this was the black day of the German Army. Now, this was something extraordinary from a small force of the 1 st AIF, particularly in the sense of the casualties they'd already taken. It's another little-known fact that they had the highest casualty rate of any of the British contingents in the First World War. Yet, right at the end, they were able to strike a decisive blow, and from that day, the German Army didn't stop retreating. (SOLEMN MUSIC) The 'ANZACS' is about the ordinary Australian who, when called upon, did extraordinary things. He should not have been forgotten for so long, but then, he didn't write books about himself. He disappeared thankfully back into civilian life, for he was always a civvy in uniform, even though, paradoxically, one of the best soldiers ever seen. He rarely spoke about that terrible war, and only emerged once a year on Anzac Day. Even for this he was often criticised, as if meeting your surviving mates and remembering your dead ones was somehow being pro-war. He mostly shrugged, knowing that fools have as much right to exist as any other in the society he defended. In 1978, a small group of old men, all veterans of the AIF, approached Amiens Cathedral on the 60th anniversary of the end of the Great War. As they entered this huge place, they were touched to find the cathedral packed in their honour. If Australians forget, the French don't. The archbishop quoted from an address their mates had heard over half a century ago. "We bow to messieurs les Australiens "for the magnificent deeds you did "in those days now happily at an end. "The soil of France is transformed "to a new divinity by your sacrifices. "In the whole of history, "we cannot find an army more marvellous in its bravery. "And in the war, there were none who contributed more nobly "to the final triumph." When armies to the right and left of them crumbled, as they did in 1918, somehow this depleted band forged a decision for that war. And... we should be told of it. These guys, the original Anzacs, the World War I fellas, they were the... they had the spirit and the courage that we all think we've got. If 'ANZACS' has one clear task, it is to make Australians feel immensely proud of themselves. It is to see themselves in a new light, in a confident light. In a triumphant light, but not in a bragging or tub-thumping light. Just think of it. A few thousand Australians travelled 12,000 miles across to another continent and decisively affected the outcome of the struggle over there. But more important than that, they brought to it the qualities of the land that had bred them. And these were, and I still believe are, unique, and this is what Australians should be reminded of. 'ANZACS', I hope, will also cause all of us to never again look at the diggers marching on Anzac Day and fail to understand. I hope like hell that the next time anyone out there sees the diggers that they will know these men and that they will love these men for what they did, for what they were, and for what they still are. (LIVELY MARCHING MUSIC) Well, if I'm back in your life, Krystle, it's by accident, not by design. - I find that hard to believe. - Why? Because this gift doesn't seem like an accident. It's far too expensive for that. This frame is not what you're upset about. You come in here accusing me of doing something. What? - You're gonna tell me you don't know? - No, I don't know. Mr. Reece. Casbah has begun to foal. I'll be right with you, Charles. Krystle, you have something to say to me? Excuse me, sir, but Dr. Porter's tied up in surgery, and Casbah appears to be in some kind of trouble. Forgive me. I don't mean to appear rude, but I've got a prize mare who's in trouble and a lot more valuable than a picture frame. Let me come with you. I can help. It's been a while, but I was raised on a farm. All right, as long as you don't get in the way. What are you doing? Oh, please, Adam, leave me alone. Claudia, what's going on? I'm moving to La Mirage. - You're leaving? - Yep. For good. I realise that things haven't been going very well between you and Steven, but is this what he wants too? It's what I want. Steven doesn't even know. What about Danny? Adam, you know that I love Danny, but Steven made it perfectly clear he's his son, not mine. Carringtons have a way of taking possession and shutting other people out. Steven is no exception. I'm sorry. You have nothing to apologise for. You've been a real good friend to me. I'm only sorry it took me so long to realise it. There can be only two reasons why you're in bed this late in the day. Either you've had one hell of a night, or you've been expecting me. Oh, Brady, thank God you are here. Hey, sweet lady. I came to bring you joy. - What's this? - What's this? What's this? - Oh, thank you. Are you all right? Well, I don't know, Brady. Brady, would you tell me, why do I have to keep proving myself all the time? Proving how talented I am, how strong I am, and how clever I am. You don't have to prove anything, not to me. But tell that to Blake Carrington. I mean, I've done everything he's asked me to do, Brady, and more, and still he will not believe me. - About being his sister. - Yes. No matter what I do. You are your own creation. Be proud of that. I am a Carrington. I don't care what I've created. You have more than the Carringtons could ever possibly hope for. Oh, what? My talent? My voice? And suppose that goes. Then what do I have left? Only my rightful name, Brady. Well, what about us? What about what we mean to each other? But why does that have to take the place of what's mine? Why do I have to choose? Why can't I have both? I am a Carrington by birth. That's who I am, and, by God, that's who I'll be. Oh. Oh, Brady. We had a hard enough time convincing Amanda to come and live with us. Why do you insist on sending her away? For us, Alexis. Because we need time together alone. Maybe Amanda should go back to the mansion, live with Blake a while. Never. For the sake of our marriage, Alexis, get her out. Send her to Paris, anywhere. You've always fought my relationship with my children, but never this much. - Why? Mommy? We're up here, darling. - Am I interrupting you? - No, no, Amanda. I'm just on my way out. Hi, darling. Sorry, my timing's not the best. Oh, no, it's all right. We were just talking business. Come and sit down. Come. Here. - That's better. - What is? Well, I'm really glad that you decided to come and live with us, Amanda. I want us to be more than mother and daughter. I want us to be friends too. Were you friends with Fallon? Well, not always, but I think at the end we were. I want to be friends too. But you can't give me conditions, because I'm not gonna give Blake up. Darling, I'm just trying to protect you. You don't know him as I do. - But he's my father, and I love him. - You love what you think he is. I know that every child wants a father. And I don't care what Rosalind told you, Blake Carrington is not your father. Then who is? I've told you, I don't know. Then you're lying. Look, I'm here where you want me, but you can't stop me from seeing who I want when I want, and that includes Blake Carrington. You're a little brat, and I'm not going to allow it. Try to stop me. Dominique Deveraux, please. Easy. Easy, now. Easy. It's her first. - I know the feeling. - Careful. She's mean with strangers. She's okay. She knows a friend when she sees one, don't you, Casbah? - How long since she started? - About 25 minutes, sir. That's too long. Something must be wrong. The left foreleg is twisted back on itself. Foal's too big for the birth canal. If you push the foal back up a little, you'll have more room to work. I know. I'll try. But if the sac breaks, we're in trouble. Shh. It's all right. Easy. Easy, now. Shh. It's all right. It's all right. We're with you. Easy. Easy. Easy. That's all right. Come on, sweetheart. Straighten up your act. Mama's waiting. Sir, the vet is on the way. So is the colt. No, no, no. It's okay. Easy does it. The legs are perfect. So is the mother. Easy, now. It's all right. Welcome back to Denver, Mr. Lloyd. Well, I'm afraid my welcome back is not what I expected. - Oh? Sit down, won't you? - Thank you. What happened? Well, I thought I knew my wife very well, Mr. Carrington. You know, strong-minded, tough. Well, that's not the woman I came back to. Mr. Lloyd, I'm not sure that I'm the one you should be discussing this with. Tell me something. Why do you refuse to accept the fact that you and Dominique share the same father? Well, that fact has yet to be proven. You just claimed a daughter. Where was your proof then? There's a world of difference between your wife and my daughter. Amanda didn't come to me claiming anything, demanding recognition. And unlike Dominique, she didn't threaten me if I refused that claim. And she didn't come to you with $70 million to save your neck either. That should prove something. That just proves she's a smart businesswoman. I promised her a sizeable return on that investment. A return beyond even her wildest dreams. Now, I promised that to her, and I will deliver that to her. I wanted to hear that from your own mouth before I made up my mind. - Made up your mind about what? - Whether you're a friend or an enemy. Now I know. You'll find me a worthy opponent. I've had to fight a lot of men, Mr. Lloyd. I haven't lost yet. I wish you luck. Oh, thank you. Will there be anything else, Mrs. Dexter? No, thank you, Lin. That'll be all. Well, isn't this more civilised than some crowded, noisy restaurant? Of course it is. No witnesses. There's no crime in having lunch together, Dominique. Alexis, why the invitation? I am a partner in Denver-Carrington. You run Colbyco. We have absolutely nothing in common. Oh, but we do. We're both ambitious, determined, professional women, like sisters, really. To prove my sincerity, I'm gonna make you an offer that you can't refuse. Really? What exactly is that? I'm offering to buy all of your shares of Denver-Carrington at a handsome profit. And I'll throw in a few shares of Colbyco too, just to make the deal irresistible. Alexis, you are many things. A sister is not one of them. There is a reason that you're interested in those Denver-Carrington shares. I'd like to know, what is that reason? A good businesswoman takes advantages of a good deal and doesn't question motives. I always question motives. That's how I've survived so long and so well. Denver-Carrington's stuck in quicksand, and you know it. - Maybe I like the challenge. - Maybe you like Blake Carrington. Yes, I choke on his name too. Get out while you can, Dominique. You are anxious, Alexis. You are too anxious. Common sense tells me you've made me an offer that I should not refuse, but- Rumour and nasty speculation tells you not to trust me. You'd be far better off dealing with me than you would with Blake Carrington. That's like asking me if I'd rather be clawed by a lion or bitten by a cobra. Either way, if I'm not careful, I could be dead. Oh, hello. What are you doing? I think it looks better over there, don't you? I'd check with Alexis before I started rearranging things, Amanda. I'm not rearranging. I'm just making myself at home, which is something my mother's gonna have to get used to. That's the trouble with having your children around. They tend to mess up your tidy life. - Well, not all children. - Just brats like me, right? Well, if that's the way you feel, Dex, why did you ask me to come back? Amanda. Yes? I had no choice. To our little colt, one hour old and still going strong. By God, I've never seen anyone gentle a horse the way you did. - That's a gift, lady, and you've got it. - Well, thank you. Thank you for your timely arrival. Um, I have to be going. Do you always leave before you finish what you start? I came to return your gift. I've done that. Krystie, you and I have just been through something very special. Don't you think that entitles me to an explanation? My sister loved you, and you walked out on her. Walked out on her? Well, yes, I left, but I didn't abandon her. - I didn't love Iris. She knew that. - You told her that? I wanted to love her. But I was in love with someone else. I couldn't help that. She understood. Well, I can't believe that. Before I left, we sat down, and we talked. I told her how I felt. I told her I didn't wanna hurt her and that I had to leave. She understood. And she didn't say anything else? - No. - And you never spoke to her again? She said she thought it best if we never see each other again. And we never did. Krystie, what was it you think I did? You really don't know, do you? No. That's the truth. I swear it. I believe you. It was just a misunderstanding. Don't leave, Krystie. Um... We have a new life to celebrate, remember? So we do. - What are you going to call him? - Um... - verdad. - Truth? Mm-hm. Somehow that little colt helped you discover the truth about me. WOMAN Dr. Stanch to Emergency Room 3. Dr. Stanch to Emergency Room 3. Oh, nurse, would you happen to know whether my wife had been here today or not? No. She phoned, said she'd be by later. - Well, did she say what time? - No, she didn't, Mr. Carrington. I see. Thank you. They look so delicate. Don't let their looks fool you. Arabians are strong. Delicate, yes, but strong. Like you. You have a real talent for horses, Krystie. Have you ever thought about working with them? Actually, I have. I've always dreamed about working with horses. Well, why don't you? I just had a baby. I waited all my life for her. Oh, that's nice. Could do both. My mother did. I was raised with horses. A gift like yours shouldn't go to waste. I wouldn't know where to begin. Oh, I can show you all there is to know about training horses, selling them, building a business around them. No, I don't think so. Why not? Blake has his career. Why shouldn't you have yours? You know, I've seen plenty of marriages like yours: rich husbands who pamper their wives with clothes and furs and jewels, and parade them around like China dolls. It's good for the husbands. Gives them power. But is it good for the wives? You don't know anything about Blake and me. And what about you? You've got power. Corporations, newspapers, wealth. I like to think I'm the exception. A relationship involves two people as partners, not one dancing to the whim of another. - You don't know my husband at all. - Don't I? Tell him you wanna start your own business. I'll tell you what he'll say: "Your business is here with me as my wife." Maybe that's where I wanna be. Krystie, you can be anything you want to be. You can make that dream come true. The only one standing in your way is you. Oh, Blake, I've had the most extraordinary day. - Krystle, where have you been? - I just came from the hospital. I know Kristina's only three weeks old, but I swear she smiled at me. And before that, I returned the picture frame to Daniel Reece. Well, that couldn't have taken all afternoon. I've been worried about you. Oh, Blake, something very special happened. Daniel Reece isn't She was not a whore as the newspapers say. She was a child. - A child? - Yes. Until that son of a bitch Peña fucked with her. If I can do something to condemn him, I'll be happy. And why not say it that evening? Because I still don't know where I want this to go. What do you mean? I'll tell you when I must. If you know something, you should tell me. I know many things, Eva For example that witness that nothing will come of. Pardon? You think what a prostitute says will put Peña in jail? She will not dare to testify against Peña. What makes you think it's a prostitute? In this business we protect each other, Eva. When one gets in a car, another writes down the plate... You know something more of this prostitute? Rocco, I can force you to testify. Forget me, please. As you wish. What happened? I'm not so sure. It was very dark and I was nervous. Don't worry, we have plenty of time. The truth is that I don't remember. You don't remember? - In your deposition you said that... - I made a mistake. I'm not sure. Have you been threatened? Are you scared? No. So? I seriously don't remember. Look into my eyes. Your Honor, I think that the witness was clear. I'm not speaking with the doctor. Look into my eyes. I was very nervous. - You could be indicted for perjury. - That's enough already, Your Honor. I'll complain to the Prosecutor. This is intolerable. Do you know what perjury is? I have done nothing. I have done nothing. The witness did not recognize the accused. But she identified the plate. It does not justify prison. Set bail and send him home. He was indicted for murder. Such cases need intelligence. How so? He is a "showman" and can fuck with the press. - So I must drop it? - Listen... Badia, of the 9th, is a commentator for channel 5. We are familiar. Carmelo, are you trying to discourage me? I'm telling you how things are. Whether we have a witness or not. I need to speak with the staff about the sale. You should go through the house to to see what you wish to to take. There are a lot of things from you. Come to the office tomorrow morning. And ready... If we signed this week the documents would be ready. One would need to get in touch with the buyer. For me there is no problem. I need to talk to you about something serious... They exchanged his doctor for another one from a football team. Can you believe it? - Are you listening? - Yes. Dad's new doctor came from a soccer team. Cool... - Sister, what's wrong? - Nothing. You look like a zombie. No... You put out four plates? Because there are four of us. Carlos is bringing his friend, Javier. The one in the photo. - You're continuing with this? - He is very friendly, Eva You need to connect. He tells every joke...! - You don't like it? - Yes, I liked it. Invite me to dinner at your home. You're crazy! See? You want everything on a silver platter? ! If you don't trust me, how can I trust you? And why in my house? What do you lose in doing so? If I talk nonsense, relieve me in 5 minutes. But if you want something real... Something potent against Peña... Like what? Liuba and I were lovers. - Were lovers? - Yes. Lovers... Liuba told you something about Peña? - What about dinner? - There will be none. - You are afraid to talk to me? - Afraid, no... What is it? Are you nervous? Look how you are! You are so hunched up! Is it that you have boyfriend? That question is inappropriate. Forgive me, as it happens I'm intrigued. "What's with her?" You are beautiful... You're a judge, lifetime salary... Has her life on the right path, but... What do you lack? What do you think is missing? I take it seriously what I devote myself to. And the very fact that I know a lot of women, is something you lack. What did Liuba say about him? You know what I think it is? You spend time preparing, but you lack contact with people. Contact? Yes. You never thought about hiring a gigolo? What's so funny? You understand nothing. No, what is it? Why do you think it's so funny? I'll never pay a man to fuck me. Of course. You were educated in a Catholic school? What did Liuba tell you? She told me she Peña was obsessed with her. A year ago he brought her to Alicante and paid her a monthly salary. Do you have proof? I am proof. Invite me for dinner. He killed your girlfriend and rather than testify against the assailant, You ask me for a dinner? What kind of person are you? And who are you? A daddy's girl who did just enough studying to be a judge. If you want something from me, invite me to dinner. If not, you already know the outcome. - Where were you? - Sorry. An hour ago I was calling you! The phone was off. I just saw the message. What happened? He suffered a hemorrhage and is in a coma. - Hemorrhage? - Yes. In other words, what happened? A burst vein in his head. He fell? No, he is 74 years old and never cared for himself in his life. You want to see him? Berta? What are you doing here? My father is in ICU and they just told me. And you? My son is under observation, he had an episode. Can I help you with something? I can apply for a permit for medical reasons for your husband. I'll take care of these things. How old is your father? Seventy... four. Well, he will recover. For years he has not recognized anyone. ...Berta I'll ask if I can get in to see him. - I hope your child is better. - Thank you. What the hell do you want? Hello! When I saw your call I thought you wanted to detain me. Don't discount anything... come in. I brought you something. Rum? You will like it. - Where did you get this? - I took it. Valentines Day of last year. This shows that they already knew each other. This is just a photo and it could be a montage. Check it out. Send it to an expert. Even if it's real, it proves nothing. This is not enough to condemn Peña. And what is needed? - Your statement. - My statement? And a confrontation. A confrontation? A confrontation between you and Peña. This is a request. I want to assure myself. You don't trust me? I know you, you always say that. Ah, but this is different. You know the risk involved to ask me this? Did I not invite you to dinner at my house? And when would it be? Tomorrow at noon if it's good for you. It's good. You will have your confrontation, but with a condition. For the rest of tonight let's not talk about the case. Not Peña, nor Liuba or anyone. I want a normal dinner. Between a man and a woman. What do you think? Yes, of course. Her name was Denise Palmer and she was from California. 40 years old and well preserved. Very much so. She was a friend of my mother. ...We dined My mother, Denise and me. My mother opened a bottle of wine And started drinking... Talking and drinking... Talking... One time my mother went into the kitchen And that left me alone with Denise. Suddenly she put her hand on my knee And then started moving up her hand... It was rising... I started to get nervous. And I looked at my mother in the kitchen collecting things. She kept on moving her hand up, it continued... Then, in comes my mother, "Rocco!" "Honey, finish your drink and go to your room Because I want to talk to Denise. " Right. We finished dessert, I went to my room, closed the door... It's not even five minutes And the door opens. And who is it? Denise Palmer? She said nothing and laid down on my bed. The next morning upon awakening I knew she had gone, but... She had left me 10,000 pesetas on the table. And a note. And so it began... it was my first time. And your mother, what did she say? Well, my mother... Got 10,000 of the old pesetas. It was money... - And your family, what did they think? - Well... My family... My father went to Nigeria 20 years ago to care for monkeys. Okay, so you no longer have family? No. I am my family. My father, my mother, my grandfather, my grandmother, all... And you? Your father the prosecutor? I see him little. - And your mother? - She died. I'm sorry. - You have siblings? - One. Younger. So the older, she went to be a judge so not to disappoint her father. And the reason you became a gigolo? To screw with your family because they did not take care of you? No, I got into it because I liked it. And besides it still paid me. I wish I had been swimming... But I fucked up my back at the Hungary Worldwide and had to stop. What about serious work? You never thought about it? My job is not serious? Yes... No... Sorry. A normal job... How normal? - As a judge? - I don't know. I love horses. Someday maybe I'll be a breeder. Someday, I don't know. Buy a cottage in the countryside. We shall see. That's why you studied veterinary medicine? - I have not finished veterinary school. - I know. - And you? What? If not a judge? What would you like to be? - I don't know. - You don't even know? Ballerina. I don't know... Ballerina? I loved to dance, but... What happened? Nothing, really. Girls must learn to use the head and not the body. My father said that. Your father was a son of a bitch. Sorry. Or is... "Not with the body... " I am sometimes mesmorized looking at the children who dance in the park. It seems incredible. Spin, and... So cute. Enjoy the moment without thinking about tomorrow, right? Liuba was a dancer. Stripper... I know. Her training was in ballet. So she would be upset, right? Why didn't you finish the veterinary medicine? You refer to the title? I did not want a title but to learn to care for animals. You know how to care for animals? It's what I concentrate on. - Healing animals with sex? - Yes... Well I would not call it that. I say "channel the energies. " Look. The libido is the most important energy that we have in the body. You can do amazing things with it. Not everyone can. - You don't say. - It's true. Yes, I know what to do with my libido. Eva, and you? - Why don't we change the subject? - And why? Because. - Do you feel afraid? - No. I think you are. It seems to me... You have an idea in your head of something... That simply will not happen. It's not going to happen? No. Forgiven. Okay. And why not? Because I never lie with a gigolo. In fact you would never pay a guy to have sex with you... But with a title it would be easier. I would not charge you. - It would be a favor? - No. It would be a pleasure. It would just be for the pleasure of fucking. You better go now. Please. Okay. I think we should see each other again. We cannot. Starting tomorrow we will be parties to the case. You want me to be contested? No... You know what it is to be banned from something, right? To have it taken away. Thanks for dinner. It's better this way. - Bye. - Bye. A gigolo? It's so strange to see the house this way. You dined at home with a gigolo? Didn't I already tell you? Hell, you are not like this! Like what? No, I know. Relating to a stranger. At your home and they still over charge. And the cost to you, to meet someone. Nothing happened. You were talking about laws? Do you think I'm going to mess with a witness? I am not crazy! Is he cute? Normal. What is normal? - Like who? - I don't know, normal. No gigolo is normal. Turns out he's a gigolo, but... He studied at a university. That's interesting. Are you in love? How so? I know nothing about law, but... Boys yes, and you're enjoying it. - I don't like him! - Like... At 12:00 I meet with him in court. He will be part of the case and I will see him no more. Are you calm now? But one day the case ends. No. I know what I'm doing, Marta. Yes? Carlos, my love... Why was it locked? Sorry. I was distracted looking at the toys. Look... Ours... I don't remember most of it. The toys that Daddy bought us When we were children. - You'll miss this house? - No. Neither will I. Ma'am, we're going. - Okay, thanks. - Until Monday. I don't even know this gentleman. You need to talk. - He knows perfectly well... - Tell him. - You know that photo. - That is a photo montage. A montage is the excuse used whenever someone is accused of something. Who is this person? Look into my eyes and tell me you don't know me. - Huh? - Here! Look into my eyes! - Tell me that you don't know me. - Your Honor... I need to answer? Yes. And control your tone, please. I don't know you. You never saw me with Liuba? - I don't know who Liuba is. - Say it to my face. I don't know who Liuba is. Do you happen to know who I am? I said I don't know you. You've never talked to me? You've never had a drink with me, motherfucker? As you said those words? Huh? You took us to dinner at "Casa Parrondo" "Sweetie I will leave my wife And buy you an apartment... " On St. Bernard street. You forgot? Don't interrupt, please. Tell me I'm making all of this up! Say it to my face, if you have courage. This is to your face... you have courage to kill a woman! Control yourselves, please! - Enough! - Motherfucker! Enough! Control yourselves, please! Take the accused and pass through the ward. - You will die in prison! - Mr. Almagro! Very well. Can you let me go, please? I am here as a witness. Stand down! I'm sorry. Do I need to sign something? No, you will be quoted in the deposition. For now, that will suffice. If you need some kind of protection, hotel... Begining today you are under directive. I am going to a house that I have in the field. Stay in touch with this court. And if you change your mind, you already know where we are. Thank you, Your Honor. "Given your insistence on hindering the work of this judgment Your visits will be suspended indefinitely. " This is your fault! - My? - By accepting the bloody confrontation. Can I finish reading? "And from now on, if you want to communicate with your client You should apply in writing. " "I also decree the transfer of Mr. Alvaro Peña To an isolation cell. " You know something? I'm going to meet with Carmelo. I've talked to him. He can help us. - Peña... - Peña... the fucking... Nobody realizes what this brat is up to. Aggression means nothing, your witness insulted him. Peña is not 15! Any judge will not condemn him for lack of a confrontation. It's not confrontation, it's testimony! Of a prostitute? What has that to do with it? Please, Peña is a public figure. He has many friends. And yet you build your case upon the testimony of a gigolo? His testimony is worth as much as any other. That's the theory. No, that's the truth. What truth? Yours or mine? The truth of the case, Carmelo. Really? And what kind of truth is this? Absolute truth? "Judicial truth?" "Probable truth?" The "divine truth?" Be careful, Eva. You will not want to be deified and lose sight of the north. - You know what to do. - No, I don't know. If I knew you would not be arguing with me. I would look for better proof. That is what I would do. Hello, Berta! - Hello - How is your son? Well. Already in school. Good! I brought a gift for him... - Don't bother. - It's nothing. It was a gift from my father when I was 10 years old. - And how is your father? - The same. You didn't come just to bring this, right? You know Alvaro Peña better than anyone, so I will be honest. I don't think that he is the type of person who will change at this point. What do you mean? Are you willing to continue waiting alone at the door of a hospital? When I need to. Do you think that's fair? - That is not the issue. - No? The issue is that your husband never supports you and you're alone. And you still protect him. Faced with evidence of the murder of an 18 year-Old girl. - You'll excuse me, but... - Certainly, His guilt is proved. You could be accused of complicity and lose custody of your son. He will stay in a community guardian center. You want to know how it is there? - For a healthy child already and... - Listen... Why are you telling me this? I want you to think of your son. Think about yourself and wonder. Wonder what? Is it really worth it? But what makes you think that I know something? Think about it. Thanks for the coffee. I found this in one of dad's boxes... What should I do with it? I don't know, but don't keep it in my house. I should keep it with me? No, you could take it to the court And say it was your prosecutor father's and he does not need it. We must take it to a police station. Why not leave it where it was? Why... it's a gun! That does not work anymore. But why not just fix it? - Because I am a judge. - Why did dad have it? It costs a lot to make an effort? You will never see him and you don't even try. Marta, he is in a coma! And before, you also would not! And you think I like that? I like to wash him? Clean his shit? I spent hours in a room that smells of disinfectant! Well, I could... Could, what? Be like you! On cruises... They almost always ask for these kinds of repertoires: Things like "Julio Iglesias", "Guantanamera," "Boleros", "La Bamba"... - I don't think so. - Eva... I didn't want to answer it. Excuse me... Forget my testimony. What did you say? Forget my testimony. They're after me. You understand? Should I call the police? Tell me where you are and I will be there. Hello! You're okay? What happened? ...What happened? How many people knew that I was here? - Nobody. - No one knew anything. You and your secretary. - You just gave me the address. - You knew I was here! Has something happened? Come in. I went for a walk And upon returning I came across that. - Someone knew I was here? - "YOU WILL DIE." Nobody? Nobody found out from me. By Carmen much less. Because they are spying. I said Peña knew many people. They will not spy on my court. Please don't be naive! I'm not, but I refuse to enter into this paranoia. And that's paranoia or what? - I did not mean it. - We must find a way to these people! - Calm down... - Either him or us! - Rocco, calm down. - Promise me you'll be able to nail him. Promise. - Promise me! - I promise. One phone call and we will have another room. - Don't call anyone. - You cannot stay here. Don't worry about me. - I'm sorry about this. - You can go if you want. I feel very sorry to have bothered. - It was nothing. - Yes It was. You said we could not see each other any more. But it was an emergency. I'm sorry, Rocco... I cannot. Cannot what? I'm sorry. - Eva, wait. - I cannot. Eva... I desire very much... I'm sorry. - Me too... - I'm sorry, I cannot... - Because you're a judge? - No. You were hurt before? If you don't want me to touch you, alright... I don't touch. Why did I do this? I don't know, but this not does not solve it. Does not solve what? I don't know. You should know. You are afraid... Afraid of yourself... to feel. That's not it. Why leave? Why run? I'm not running. What do you think you're doing? I should not have come. What tasty perfume. This cannot happen again. I'll ask for protection and you will be taken to a hotel. No, I don't want any hotel! What will you do? Continue with my way of life... I don't want anything to happen to you. Why? Because I am your witness? And why not? "... This cannot happen again. " "I'll ask for protection and you'll be taken taken to a hotel. " "No, I don't want any hotel!" "What will you do?" "Continue with my way of life... " "I don't want anything to happen to you. " "Why?" "Because I am your witness?" - Morning. - Morning. Why didn't you tell me you were coming? My son is out there. I decided to do it now. Decided what? Tell you everything I know. Carmen, can you bring us water, please? Thank you. I'm sorry. That night he didn't sleep at home. I heard... Noise from the shower and found him in the downstairs bathroom. He said they had stolen his car and... Was closing a contract and... Does not remember anything. And if asked... I should say that he slept at home. The next morning he burned all his clothes, Cleaned the ashes and asked me not to say anything. That's what he did. I don't know what happened to that girl. But if his alibi was that he was with me, that's a lie. You would be willing to declare that before a court? - And my son? - Don't worry about that. He is the only one that matters. I can request treatment under witness protection. What does that mean? Currently, you would be taken to a hotel and then... We will look for a place for you to live, a new identity, a house... - I can choose? - Pardon? The house where we live needs to be near a hospital. Of course, we will try. Now you must go home and... My employees... They will help you pack the suitcases and to take them to the hotel. I recommend you take the minimum and anything mobile. If you need to talk to someone, call me. It can be day or night. And if you want to talk to me? I call the hotel. And ask for me? You can change your name. Trust me, Berta. Eva? How are you? I have good news. We have good reasons to condemn Peña. You don't say... I cannot give you details, just... Stay calm... Everything's okay. Just wanted you to know. Everything's okay. Finally, everything is fine. Thank you! I'm much more relaxed. Thanks. Very tasty, huh? It's a shame that this video serves no purpose. If Eva has a new witness we need to know who it is. - There are none. - She said she did. It makes no difference. I did what you asked me and you already have a recording. I'm out. This does not serve, Rocco I don't want to burn, lñaki. Even though I know I will. You remember what you told me when we first met? "Leave it to me! ... " "I don't want to get burned"... - You will not do this to me. - I am. It seems you have no memory, that I have been screwed before. And I've aleady been screwed too many times. And then I have to give explanations. Rocco, don't forget who you are. The strength and the rod. There is a limit, lñaki. There's a line and we cannot cross it. - You told me that. - Yes... But the line moves... Don't you realize? One day is here... The other is right here! Until when? Until I say. Hey! Eva! - What are you doing here? - I don't know where to go. Peña's people are following me. I swear. I'm going crazy! You said you didn't need help. But I was wrong. I thought I could stand alone but I cannot. - Quiet. - All day stuck in my car. The whole day going around... I cannot concentrate nor work. Let's go to a hotel. I don't want! What do you want? Let's go to your home! No, my house is not an option. - Not an option? - No. - It makes no sense. - You prefer not to risk it? I trust you, Eva I need you to help me, please. I cannot take you to my house. But of course... of course... There's another witness, right? That's not so. Please don't lie to me. It's another prostitute? - A pimp? - I cannot give details. I am passing for an idiot! Get what you want and then throw me in the trash! For you it provides the same and I live on the street. Did you also give yourself to the other witness? You have no right! Of course... Because you're a judge and I a simple gigolo. Rocco! Rocco! It's my dad's house. It was, because we are selling it. Monday I will take your statement and then you can go wherever you want Until the trial and you'll be called as a witness. You grew up here? It's strange to have a man here other than my father. You never bring any men here? I'm the first? Yes. Now you go away? I need to buy something. There's nothing to eat here. And a few blankets or something... Come dine with me. On Monday in the morning the sale takes place and we'll take what's left. Right. As long as no one is there over the weekend... Are you crazy? All I ask is a little cooperation. Then ask for the police. You are a female judge. We cannot trust anyone. That's your problem. I cannot abandon him. - You're not his mother. - Marta I don't... I'm not asking permission, okay? I put him there. What are you getting into? It'll be okay. - What will be okay? - Trust me. You fucked him? I was wrong. - What's got into you? - Nothing. Nothing? Strange to be doing it here. I like to be here. Why are you called Rocco? You've seen "Rocco and His Brothers" with Alain Delon? Of course. My mother loved that movie. - We're so different. - Why? For starters, your life's not worse than anyone elses. That's what you think. I don't need a prosecutor father to screw up my life. I never said that he screwed it up. There are things that don't need to be said. What do you mean? It's carried inside. And according to you that would be? - Rancor... - Rancor? - No... - You don't blame him for anything? That's from a book of self-Help therapy? I never read anything like that in my life. I enjoy listening to the women and... When they speak of their parents, they feel better. Tell me about yours. You don't blame him for anything? It's complicated, Rocco. Why? If I had to blame him for something I would not be for who I am. A Judge? Have you told him that? You should. Now is the time. People who are comatose can listen. That's what they say. You know the first thing I thought when I saw Liuba dead? Not "how beautiful she was" "how horrible to die. " It was... "Poor thing, no more time remains to solve anything. " I'm sorry. Listen... This new witness... You know this exposes them to be tampered with by Peña? Yes, you know. - I'd like to meet her. - Why? To be sure that nothing has been invented... Small details are... I did not invent anything, Rocco. I don't to want talk about it. Will I have to shut up again? Will I have to? Sorry. Yes... Yes, pardon. I told you I'd call... But I did not... What? You called a doctor? I'll send an ambulance. Be calm. Stay calm. I'm going there. Okay. - Something happened? - I need to go. Some problem with your father? No. You can't tell me now? Sorry. Eva! You gonna take long? I don't know. I'll leave money in case you need to buy food or... I'll be back as soon as possible. Be very careful... What? Wait a minute, please... Trust me. It'll be all right. I withdrew money from the ATM. And bought Japanese food. You like? No need to. It's our farewell... What is it? Nothing, but... You left and I got to thinking... About a few things... What things? You'd come back and I would be sitting here waiting for you As if we were a normal couple... And? Nothing... It would be very nice. I'll take a shower. - You think it's a punishment? - Why? Your father was a prosecutor and ordered many people to prison. Me too. - But you're different. - How do you know? Because I know. You don't know. You don't know anything. I know nothing about you... How is it nothing? ... if you investigated me? No... I read a mountain of papers but the things are not there. What would you like to know? What do I want to know? Who are you. The truth. Come. Come on. Come with me. That'll do until tomorrow... - What? - Once you take my statement. I go to the airport and catch a flight to Edinburgh. - Edinburgh? - I have a half-Cousin there. He's cultivating mushrooms and I will help him. It sounds good. You are going to live on that? I have some savings, too. You will cease your career as a gigolo? I am who I am, no matter what my career. In truth, in the heart. You are a judge. Tomorrow you may not be, but the important thing is to be you. Tomorrow? Yes.. It's a figure of speech. I find it very cool, but you didn't have to go that far. I give faith that everything I said is true And that I don't encourage any type of revenge against Mr. Alvaro Peña. The only thing I want is that justice is done And he pays for everything he did. - Want to add something else? - No, Your Honor. You already communicated your new address to the secretary of the court? - Yes, Your Honor. - All that remains is your signature. Thank you, Carmen. - I need to sign all? - As if it were a contract. You may be required to go before the court. Take it. Thank you. Thank you very much for your cooperation. Thanks for everything. Goodbye, Your Honor. With this, that concludes the testimony. Not missing any documents? I expect the defense to provide their allegations to Carmelo. We'll get together then. Look where you're going! I don't know what to say. Think you're ready to go to trial? I am also impressed with this case, I want you to know that. I understand. Yes? Yes, she's here. It's your secretary. Tell her I will be down soon. She said it's urgent. Your Honor, through here. It's through here. Berta's death changed the whole procedure. Peña was released for lack of evidence. The case was shelved... Without culprits. Without anyone having to pay. I decided to take a break. Request a transfer... Start over. But I could not. I got suspended, Removed from office... And stopped being a judge. Hello, good afternoon. Room 212, a young lady? - Go up the stairs to the right. - Okay, perfect. Hello! MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME... WAIT FOR ME ON THE BALCONY... Eva. Eva! Don't do it! No! No! No! There are things that don't depend on you... That must be done... It is your destiny. You did not raise me to forgive, Dad. You always taught me to judge! Condemn... Now I'm willing to judge and condemn myself. You said that in the laws, are the best of each one of us. But you made a mistake. The best of me is not in the manuals of law. Not in any laws or anyything we learn. The best of me... Is in a life that I haven't had. The one that I didn't dare to live. I definitely know I'm in storage. But why? You're in storage with a million others. And nobody's buying your stuff. Storage? Storage! Storage! Anyone there? Rousku and Raninen? Rousku, answer! Are you down there? Can't get any lower. KINOSTO PRESENTS A TARU MÄKELÄ FILM STORAGE BASED ON THE NOVEL BY ARTO SALMINEN WRITTEN BY VELI-PEKKA HÄNNINEN Niskanen will be at the back door. Take fifteen sacks of Carlite plaster to him. You'll recognize Niskanen? Yeah, from the back. Very funny. Move it. The store is full of people. - Thank Him. - Who? The son of David. Fifteen sacks of plaster. Roger. Get to work, homo. I'm in the middle of a game. And I'm your boss, homo. Had a fight with the missus this morning. Threw a cup of yogurt at her. Plum and apricot. I ruined her perm. Crazy bitch. She thinks I'm sleeping around. - Are you? - Are you? All the time. Storage! What is it? Bring me two ten-liter latex paint buckets. As soon as I can. She threatened to divorce me. I might be an ex soon. That makes two of us. I'm an ex too. Yeah? Whose? No one's in particular. In general. I don't want to get a divorce. She's good looking. Looks like last year's Miss Seaside. - What's her name? Hanna. No, I mean Miss Seaside's. I don't know. What the hell are you doing? Shake your head. It looks like the bucket stops moving. - Bullshit. See for yourself. It won't stop moving. Shake it! Storage! Shit. - Are you there? No, we're here. Where is the latex paint? The customer's waiting. We're busy! Send the customer here and I'll shove the bucket up his ass. I'm sorry. You monkeys! When are you going to get it? We can hear your cursing and yelling upstairs! There are women customers! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Keep in mind that the world is full of unemployed guys! Antero. Jylhäkorpi. Hi. I salute you, member of the proletariat - in your ripstop nylon garment. Did you lose weight? Gain weight? I always weigh the same. It's a law of physics. I may have a criminal mind, - but I have to obey the law of gravity. Joker. I'll have forty liters of black acrylic paint. Where's the knucklehead? He's at lunch. He doesn't suspect anything? Raninen? He's been paralyzed from the neck up since birth. I know what this is all about. All what? All this. Society. Respecting laws. Good for you. Want me to take these to the car? This is the playoffs. What are you doing standing there? Is it forbidden? It looks suspicious. Would it be okay if I was smoking? Or pretended to be waiting for someone? Look at that old woman. I'll go shout something nasty in her ear. I know you will. Ma'am. A cute old lady like that. Just had the longest shit ever. One end in my ass with the other end in the water. - Wow. Congratulations. Attention, shoppers. Karita Nieminen just had the longest shit ever... - Asshole! Relax, I didn't push the button. Still. What's wrong with him? When you move your head fast enough, - the paint bucket stops. Yeah right. See for yourself. It does. Try it. Shake it all the way from your knees. Stop it! Shut up! You'll kill me one day. My neighbors will kill me. What are you doing? I'm going home. Right after sex? It would be crazy to leave before. You could stay the night. We could go to work together. I have to change clothes and everything. You ignore me at work. How so? I say good morning and thank you. - I'm just saying. - Saying what? We can't start screwing at work. Bye. A lot of guys would be happy even to work in storage. - Bullshit. The only people willing to do this - are drunks or wanted by the police. - Which are you? You have to be crazy to drag these buckets around for free. Blame yourself. Any loser could do your job. Bullshit. I blame corporations. They replace as many people with machines as they can. They get a kick out of creating poverty and misery. Having to come here ruins my day. Listen. It ruins my day too. You're wearing the exact same clothes as yesterday. Stop groping me! Mom's little darling, did you have breakfast? I scraped the white stuff off my teeth and ate that. What stuff? Yesterday's chicken balls. Gross! Don't you brush your teeth? I don't have a toothbrush. Can I borrow some milk? Please do. Karita, Kataja wants to see you. My coffee will get cold. You can't keep the boss waiting. Come on. Look at these numbers. Things are disappearing from storage. This sure looks strange, doesn't it? What's the date of this entry? January 12th. As if today's poor could afford morality. You've got some theories. That's right. I'm an old communist; I know these things. 26. - You won. - Storage! - Shit. Yes, dear? Seven rolls of wallpaper. Rasch Victoria. 718409. Bring it up, please. Rasch Victoria. I'll bring it up. You fucked Karita. How do you know? I just found out. - You assumed? - I guessed. Assuming is too difficult for a storage worker. - What is she like? - Who? Karita. Well. Nothing special. The basic stuff. She howls like a roller coaster. How do you know? How do you think I know? Shit. Is everybody doing her? C'mon, think about it. They don't teach you those tricks in home economics. Thanks for not bringing them up. You have a customer waiting? I'll take these up. Let's go have lunch at the Chinese restaurant. - No. It costs 7 euros. I'll buy a meat pastry at the store. I need to tell you something important. You have potatoes? Yes. Rice with everything. Or french fries. Okay. I'll have the sweet and sour pork. I'll have Kung Pao chicken. Yes. Thank you. This place is run by some criminal - who smuggles Chinese people into the country. He keeps them in chicken cages. How do you know? It was in the paper. Where do you live? Lauttasaari. Yes. How many of you are there in the apartment? Stop giving him a hard time. I just asked him a question. But he doesn't understand. How do you know? He just doesn't understand Finnish. Bullshit. Look at him wiping those tables. Why the hell is he smiling all the time? I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. Say something. - Whose is it? - Yours. No, it's not. Even your neighbors' dogs are screwing you. And Raninen. Stop being an asshole. It's our baby. We can take a genetic test or a yeast sample. You're on the pill. How can you be pregnant? I just am. Fuck you. You did this on purpose. Last winter you talked about having a baby. I've been taking the pill. You can still get pregnant. Who wants to have a baby with a 35-year old tramp? I'm 30. You could've asked me before you got yourself pregnant. You have to have an abortion. I've already been to the maternity clinic. Maternity clinic! Yes, maternity clinic. Stop yelling. They asked if the father is excited. I said he sure is. You've got a cross-breeze in your head and between your legs. Yes. Pork. Kung Pao chicken. Yes. Thank you. I told the nurse you talk to my belly. They said you're welcome there. You could listen to the heartbeat. It's like a horse galloping. You didn't give them my name, did you? - Of course I did. I gave them your name and address. I said we were moving in together. This can't be happening. They asked me if you work or study. I told them you're unemployed. Unemployed? Why the hell did you say that? Next time we'll tell them you found work. It'll make them happy. You're a fucking fluffhead. You're totally crazy. Aren't you going to ask how far along I am? - No. That's exactly what you men are like. Ready to screw but can't handle the responsibility. I would've used a tractor inner tube - if I'd known you were feeding your pills to your fish! Check, please! You can move in whenever you like. We make the perfect couple - because your ascendant is in Taurus. Yeah. I don't want to hear about this ever again. Try feeding your story to some other guy. I promise I'll keep my mouth shut. - Yes. - Yes. What are you doing? It feels good. Give me the knife. You're right. Strange I hadn't thought of this before. - That's enough. So you decided to have a manicure? This is a pedicure. I don't know big words. I even dropped out of swim school. She's an airhead. The social workers will take the baby - the minute it pops out of her ass. Be sensible. There'll be a blood test, court case and foreclosure. I don't care. It'll be easier on you if you settle the child support with her. You don't have to become a real dad. Or change shitty diapers. I have to pay her for what she did? What are you doing? - I'll send a message to my offspring. Smoke signals from this side of the twilight zone. Don't eat these. What the fuck are you doing airing out your toes here? - I have to. Haven't washed them in a week. These must have been on the shelf for five years. Or in the ass of the camel on the pack. - Two packs? - Yes. What for? For a termination of pregnancy. Yes, but why two packs? These are very strong. One is enough. You mustn't exceed the dosage. One isn't enough. I need it for two women. Play with fire, sometimes you get burned. 38 euros. That's a phone number. In case you have questions. I should collect rent from you. Oh, sorry. This article is just so interesting. About a new gallery. They're holding Keitsi Kejonen's exhibition. I totally got to check it out. Here. Thank you. - Serves him right. - What? He stole my yogurt. Fuck. Is that a dartboard you're drawing? I just thought... It was a bit quiet here. The whole nation is crying for more jobs, - but when you hire people... I didn't know you had time to throw darts. I don't throw darts. I'm taking this home to my kids. To your kids? They're grown up. How can you have grown-up children? How old are you? I mean, they're a friend's kids. Jesus. What's this? It was... damaged in transit. In transit? Looks like someone stabbed it. Must have been damaged in the factory. Losses are poison to business. I can offer jobs - because I know the bottom line. People sure are at the bottom. What? Nothing. One guy in main storage was selling goods to people. He would've gone to jail if his parents hadn't taken a loan. They had to use their house as collateral. You can accuse me of many things, but not stealing. No need to get upset. You should pay us more. Poor people wouldn't have to pay for their houses twice. What did you just say? Nothing. I pay my workers according to the trade union salaries. I can tell the payroll office you want to quit. I didn't say that. Keep it down then. Did you have to piss him off? He accused me of stealing. No, he didn't. If he tells people I'm stealing, you'll testify for me, right? Yeah. The hell I will. Why do I have to do everything myself? - Thank you. I only sell paint, but I'm still a human being! What's wrong with him? If he was a woman, I'd say he's on the rag. He's acting crazy. Come have a break. No, I won't. I need to talk to you. You shouldn't smoke, should you? Sweet. You're worried. I'm not. But it's not the fetus's fault the mom is as dumb as a peanut. If I quit, I'd get a terrible cough and nausea. I'd get anxious. The baby would suffer and kick restlessly. - Who told you that? - A doctor. You're lying. It was a doctor. I met him in a bar. Jesus! That's a real health clinic for you. What did you want to talk about? About moving in? Let's be serious. I'll pay part of the abortion. There won't be one. There will be a baby. A cute little bundle of joy. It'll be a boy if he takes after his father. He has little eyes and a little mouth. Little eyebrows and everything. Little hands and little feet. And tiny little nails. Okay. I mean, you're the unwanted one that should be terminated. I want to tell you that I'll pay child support- but won't do a paternity test or play house with you. Why are you so negative? Because kids are what I hate most in the world. Second most, adults. Men. And women. Except when I'm fucking them. Just so you know, the big boss is in the staff room. Mind your language on the intercom. Don't throw darts. What's he doing here? Going over the books. He's got a pile of receipt rolls and delivery lists on the table. - Why? - I don't know. Maybe this store is unprofitable. I mean, this isn't unprofitable, - but it's not profitable enough. Soon we'll all have to... look for jobs. Kataja is a man of action. He won't negotiate if there are going to be layoffs. Or maybe someone is stealing from here. Not the toilet. I need to go into the shop. What the fuck is going on? Everybody's talking about stealing. I'll take lunch. How come you're so jumpy? I'm not. How long will the bonehead be gone? At least 45 minutes. Son. I need a couple of rolls of carpet. Stop, for fuck's sake. Whole rolls? - Yup. Three of those blue-gray ones. Jesus. They cost a thousand a piece. They don't cost you anything. They'll cost me my job. The big boss is here checking receipt rolls. He'll notice if that carpet disappears. There's stuff worth millions here. He'll have to check years of receipt rolls - before anyone notices anything. I'll go to jail. That'll be the end of my career. If he even notices, - I'll be the criminal. You can say you were taking a shit. That would be one heck of a turd. A marine cable. You could have constipation. Believe me. There's no risk of you getting caught. Besides, - you'll get your share. Kataja is rich because he robs people. That's why he's afraid people will rob him. Society is built around crime and guilt. Society wouldn't function if there was no crime. Crime is the highest form of humanity. Your shitty philosophy won't help me if I get caught. Why do you steal at your job? You told me to. - Don't try to blame me for your choices. Why? - Storage worker's salary is too low. Your life is too high for your salary. That's a nice watch. You wear an expensive leather jacket. That must've cost at least 300 euros. - 500. You don't steal to live. You steal because you want to live large. That's your motive. Why do you steal? Don't get mad. I just want you to have clear morals. You can't have high morals because you're a thief. But your morals have to be clear! Impossible for me. That's right. Because you're a child of your time. There's nothing clear about you. Not even tears - because you don't know how to cry. I'm writing an application for a million euros. I'd be happy to get out of this shit. Have you ever won the lottery? Yeah. How much? - I win money every time I don't buy a lottery ticket. I play the same numbers every week. But I reorganize them every now and then. But you play the same numbers? Yup. What's the point of crossing them off in a different order? I try to get them in the order they come out of the machine. I want the jackpot, not the extra winning numbers. Got it. - Rousku. - What? Come to the staff room. I just had coffee. You didn't. Ask the store manager if you can borrow the company van. Why? - Because he's found his feminine side. What for? - You can bring your stuff to my house. I'm not moving into your place. When are you going to get it? You can move on the weekend. I'm not your boyfriend. Karita. Get it in your head, will you? You don't know what's best for you. There is no best for me. Yes, there is. Here. Fuck! Listen, darling. You'll move in with me. We'll have fun together. If you don't want to move, - I'll tell Kataja and the store manager you steal at work. What the fuck did you just say? You think I haven't noticed? It's that big old guy. Comes and gets stuff when Raninen is at lunch. All he ever pays for is a paintbrush or a roll of tape. You've got it all wrong. That's an old friend of my dad's. He comes here to talk. Oh yeah? Then there must be a receipt for the carpet you put in his van. The store manager? Could you check if Rousku sold three rolls of carpet yesterday? Or if he stole them. Fuckin' lunatic! Excuse me. What was it? I couldn't hear you. Nothing. Forget it. Oh, I almost forgot. Congratulations, Rousku! Why? - You're having a little storage worker. Bring cigars when he's born. Horror. Could somebody please shoot me? Stop whining. You're a big boy. We've spent practically every weekend together. We've had fun, haven't we? In bed, you pant and bellow like a bull when you cum. And if I say no? I'll tell Kataja. You'll go to jail. You don't have parents that could bail you out. Fucking blackmailer. Fucking thief. Please hang your clothes over the balcony to air out. I don't want fur beetles in the house. Should I also go to the balcony? Honey, you'll sleep next to me. You think we should get a bigger bed? It's no use. What? - That bed will be fine for the time I'll be living here. - What time? - About three years. The average length of relationships in the suburbs. I'm happy we get to go to work together- and go shopping at the mall. - Yeah. I'll put your books in the cleaning closet for now. I guess I need to get a book shelf. You actually read these all? Almost. I've never read a book and never will. Why not? - It's like watching TV without the picture. With just the sound. You're definitely not the sharpest pencil in the box. But I'm still the woman of your dreams. You sure are. These cookies are like Oreos, but a lot cheaper. There's no sense in buying Oreos. I HAVE RESTLESS FEET SPANK ME, BABY! SINGING BEE Ladies and gentlemen. This man is sweet like fudge. Producer Vexi Salmi is the judge! Vexi Salmi is his name! Cut the crap. Looks like we have a tough judge tonight. Here we go. She went off the pill! How do you know? Women do it these days. "A mother and a wife" sounds more respectable - than "long-term unemployed." "Multiply and fill the earth." If you can't find work. There should be a law against the pill. Son, don't say that. We didn't have the pill when I was young. It was damn hard to get laid. We didn't have porn magazines or videos, either. We stared at the girl on the cover of the oatmeal box. And jerked off. Go. Before Kataja or somebody else comes. Now you have a good reason to steal. What do you mean? You'll steal a future for your child. How else will a storage worker's child become something in life? Or he'll become a loser like his parents. He'll learn the tricks in your local elementary school. And the rest in prison. Maybe it's better I go to prison instead. Of course you have to meet her. Why? We're having a baby, which makes her your mother-in-law. Have you forgotten I'm becoming a father against my will? So how can I have a mother-in-law? It's important to her. And to you. My mom's okay. If she's anything like you, she's ugly and stupid. I understand you. You act cocky because you're under my thumb. Smells like piss here. Are these city rental flats? Yeah. Mom was lucky to get one. Right. I hope her boyfriend's not there. He's gross. That's his name on the door? Mynttinen? Uh-huh. Come on in. So this is Antero. - Hello. - Hello. Come on in. There's coffee and cake. Hello. Asshole. So - you'll be a father soon. I guess I have no choice. I'm happy to become a grandma. I've even looked like a grandma for ages. Are you - going to be in the delivery room? Karita promised to be there. He'll be there. These days all men do. What do they do there? I don't know. They watch your privates rip apart. It's still lovely to have your man by your side. When I was having you, - your dad was running around on me. Other men brought flowers, but your dad never came. He was busy elsewhere. Mom, shut up. Antero's not interested. I see. Shoot. Shoot! How do you put up with a guy like that? Well, it's not like I can lure Robert Redford here. What do you need a man for? You know what I need him for. You're a woman. I'm sure you understand. I like it when my lady neighbors are jealous - when I'm out, happy and glowing with my man. And he doesn't beat me. Antero doesn't, either. Are you going to get married? We don't know yet. - No, we're not. - That's good. It's easier to separate when the time comes. And it will come. Yes, it will. That's right. Mom. You have lipstick on your teeth. You should've said earlier. Karita's father liked to try out business ideas. Then he tried to kill me. Then he tried to kill himself. The second time he succeeded. Thanks to your dad, we lived in poverty. I had to cut up old pigskin gloves for soup meat. I did have a salon in Kallio, though. Fine people used to come in. Sinatra did. Mom, please. - Who? - Sinatra. Frank Sinatra. - In Kallio? - That's right. Why would he have been there? His hair must have gotten too long. She never believes anything. He came in many times. You charged the regular price? I'm not telling you. I'm not saying anything. What the fuck? An olive? You have a good man in Rousku. I can tell he's bad-tempered enough. He'll do okay in life. Not that well, but okay. Someone like me can't even do okay. What's wrong with your life? Are you parents alive? My mom is. Technically. I can come over and babysit. You'll get to go to the bar. Hell no. You'll just make a mess if you come over. Listen now. I've got tons of parenting advice. I don't need it. See you. Fine. See you. Don't believe everything my mom says. - Oh yeah? I think she used to be a hooker. At least she never had a salon. They say poverty is inherited. When I look at you and your mom... Whew. Don't worry about me. You have to think about your child's future. He's got no future. He's a third-generation loser. - Hi. - Hello. Who's in there? Jarkko and Juha. Gotta have a beer. Boy, put your headphones on. You went to the store. Bring me liverwurst. On bread? No, the whole thing. What's on? Current Issues. The erosion of public health care. Blah. What's on Channel 1? A documentary on euthanasia. Great. How long can I fuck you? Almost till I give birth. You want to? - Yeah. I guess you're an alternative mother too. But I'm not as crazy as them. I'll tell you a little about the admittance examination. Excuse me. May I tell how I've prepared? Sure. I've analyzed my dreams and visions. I've harnessed the energy in them. In the summer we both had recurring dreams about birds. I made a mask with bird feathers. We built a nest with reeds at our summerhouse. I like to go in it and hatch my belly. Thank you. Yes, alternative child birth is a good... alternative. Let me tell you about the examination. You don't really think about the mothers here. You want us to be slaves to medicine and hospital hierarchy. Why don't you emphasize - the importance of singing and shouting during childbirth? Jesus Christ. In the army they make servicemen sing. It drains you out on the march. We didn't go to the army. That's a shame. You'd make great officers. Okay, let's get some fresh air. I want to talk to you. Get in. I'm on my lunch break. Then you have time. We'll take a short ride. It's in here. Now it'll happen. Hey, sit down. Sit down. Yeah. It's nice to have a visitor. [ Rustling ] There you go. So, did you see any fireworks? No. No. Oh, these days, sometimes I see flashes of light, you know, popping around me anywhere, anytime. That doesn't sound good, Jer. No, it's... No. [ Chuckling ] No, it's nothing. No, it's... It's like, uh... It's like... You know, it's like getting to see fireworks is a temperamental pastry chef who is trying to create a masterpiece for the demanding owner of his restaurant, Drew. We need that cake five minutes ago-- [lN FRENCH ACCENT] Don`t ever tell me how to make a cake. I`m a master. I must get prepared. Hurry and get prepared. Wear your stupid hat. You don`t look so great chef to me. I put it on my head like so, and I look like Jiffy Pop. That`s what I said, Jiffy Pop. Listen, I don`t know if these hors d`oeuvres are any good. Those won`t be served. -Why not? -I almost swat them. These are for my own personal-- I use these for impressions. -Let`s hear one. -Look, this is my favorite-- Looks like Carol Channing. [imitates CAROL CHANNlNG] lt`s really sugary. [lN FRENCH ACCENT] Give me some cupcakes. Give me some cupcakes and guess what I am. I need two. I need two. -Why don`t you juggle? -What am I? [buzzing] Hurry up. They want their name on it. -Do you know what this is? -lt`s a pastry-- It`s a pastry squirter. Shall we decorate the cake? I will decorate the top. Who shall I make it out to? -Their names are Mike and Diane. -Very careful. -Mike and Diane Lipschwitz. -Very careful. M. -Don`t forget this one. -Oh, yes. I will-- They want it in different colors. I. I don`t have enough frosting. Tell me, do they look--? Do they look--? -The sprinkles? -They need sprinkles. I can`t put those sprinkles on. I lose control when I have sprinkles. I`m shaking. I- - I still remember the great sprinkle accident of 1 982. [audience laughing AND cheering] I look like Walt Disney just threw up. CAREY: What about this stuff? This stuff-- -That`s raw dough. Never eat it. -Why, what happens? -lt can make worms in your tummy. Worms in your tummy. What does raw dough taste like? Does it taste bad? You can`t eat raw dough. Yeah. I bet you could. Go ahead and eat it. -lt`s fun. -lt`s bad for you. -lt can`t be that bad. It`s all-- -Let me have a little try. [audience laughing AND applauding] It`s not bad. Here are some strawberries to wash that down. I don`t eat any vegetables or fruits. -You ought to try it. -Strictly sugar. Strictly sugar for me. -Oh, really? -One, and a two and a- - Ha- - Ha-- Wow. CAREY: Try another one. That was close. -Really? Okay. -lt`ll entertain me if you do that. -Ah.... Ha- - Ha- l`m a failure. -Oh, no. [BUZZER sounding] [audience cheering AND applauding] Now you ruined their cake. Thanks for watching Whose Line Is It Anyway? . -We`ll see you later. Goodbye. BRADY: That cake looks good. [english SDH] Hello? Hello? I'm here. Hello? I'm here to see Mr. Kurros. Could you...? Could you tell me where to find Mr. Kurros? Ooh... Wait. Do not mind Bevvox. He can be... grouchy in the morning. Welcome aboard. Thank you. You seem tense. No. This is a time for celebration. The geo-stability of your world has been restored... your people saved... and all because you had the wisdom to accept our help. You accomplished in days what our scientists failed to achieve in decades. That it not to say it was not a challenge. Finding the precise harmonic for a planetary containment field did put my colleague here to the test, but, in the end... she prevailed. We owe you our lives. Solving problems is what we do, and seeing the look of gratitude in your eyes is almost reward enough. Almost. I have some bad news. Our bernicium mines were destroyed in the last series of quakes. The ore's buried under 60 gigatons of rock. We can't get to it. We hoped you'd accept this instead. A rubidium geode. Priceless. The only one ever found on our planet. It is rare... but hardly unique and it is not what we agreed upon. I'm sorry. This is all we can offer you. You are lying. The mines collapsed, but before they did, you transferred the ore to a shielded storage facility. Needless to say... we detected it. Please, we need the ore to repair our replicator systems. Without it, we'll be unable to feed our people. Get it to us now... or I will deactivate the containment field. Have you ever experienced a level-12 seismic event? Most find it quite unnerving. No. I'll have the ore transported at once. This... this was all a misunderstanding. Of course. It is already forgotten, my friend. Perhaps we will do business again someday. Yes. Show our friend back to his shuttle. I would hate for him to get lost in such an unfamiliar place. Oh! Pardon me. Yes. Captain, long-range scans have detected... One second. I've wasted two hours on this thing and I'm no closer to solving it. You can thank Ensign Paris for introducing the artifact to the ship. He was behind the last shipwide craze, too-- "yo-yos." Now it's "sheer lunacy." Another hour and I'll go insane. The solution is quite simple. If you align... No. I want to figure this out myself. You said something about long-range scans? They've revealed a planetoid with high concentrations of dilithium crystals. Let's take a look. Got it! False alarm. Keep at it, Harry. We're within visual range. On screen. Initial scans revealed substantial dilithium deposits beneath the planetoid's crust. Full sensor sweep. The deposits are in the upper mantle, about 60 kilometers down. We'll have to use phasers to cut through... Hold on. What is it? Some kind of resonance wave emanating from the core. It's building fast, Captain. Right after we ran our scans. That can't be a coincidence. Back us off, Tom. The planetoid is destabilizing. Shields. Report. We're trapped in a cloud of metreon gas. It's collapsed our warp field and knocked impulse engines off-line. A heavily armed vessel just dropped out of warp, off the port bow. Captain, I recognize it. It's Hazari. Species 4228. Technologically advanced, extremely violent. They make excellent tactical drones. What do they want with us? The Hazari are hired to capture and deliver alien vessels. Bounty hunters. Yes. So who hired them? The Malon, the Devore-- we've made our share of enemies here. They're hailing. Surrender. No one need be hurt. My client would prefer your vessel intact. Who hired you? That's not your concern. I'm only asking because I'm curious how much they're paying. Maybe we can do better. Doubtful. We're far from defenseless. Why don't you save yourself some trouble. It's no trouble. Charge phaser banks to full power. Fire and you'll ignite the gas cloud. You'll be destroyed. You've left me no choice. I suggest you back off if you want to save your own ship. End transmission. They are moving closer. They've locked on a tractor beam. Looks like they're calling your bluff, Captain. It was a bluff, wasn't it? Seven, do we still have warp power? Yes, but it's useless while we remain in the gas cloud. Maybe not. Reroute every spare gigawatt to the shields. Prepare to fire phasers. Our target? The gas cloud. Do you believe the impact will throw us clear? If our shields hold. That's a big if. Go to warp 1 on my command. Fire. Shields are holding. We're approaching the perimeter of the gas cloud. We're out. Warp speed. No sign of pursuit. They weren't that heavily damaged. Why aren't they following us? There's the reason they didn't come after us. They've got reinforcements throughout the sector. 23 ships. And long-range scans show more on the way. Must be one hell of a reward. The size of the bounty is immaterial. According to Seven of Nine, the Hazari pride themselves on honoring their agreements. Great. Bounty hunters with a work ethic. There's got to be a way out, something they haven't anticipated. Download the data for the Captain. She wants to see what she can come up with on her own. Should I have the Doctor prepare a hypospray? Excuse me? So you can absorb the caffeine more directly. Save time. Point well taken. I'll make this my last cup. How about trying a sounding board? Oh, you don't want that job. Try me. It's these Hazari. They're like jackals. Circling... feinting to draw us out while they cut off every route of escape. You make them sound worse than the Borg. At least the Borg come straight at you. The Hazari wait, invite you to make mistakes. They've anticipated almost every move we can make, and the few things they seem to have missed, I'm convinced are traps. You still glad you volunteered? We've faced tough odds before. You'll get us through. Good night. Night. There is nothing like a good problem to spark the synapses, is there? To open the mind to new possibilities... new ways of seeing things. Of course, one must always confront self-doubt and fear, but that is a small price to pay for the... exhilaration of finding the perfect solution. Who are you and what do you want? You have a problem, Captain. I am the solution. Security to the Mess Hall. Intruder alert. I deactivated your communications device, Captain, but do not worry. I am not an intruder. In fact, I am not really here. A hologram. Nothing so crude. An isomorphic projection. You actually enjoy this? It's an acquired taste. It bears a resemblance to an Alkian confection we acquired several years ago. "We"? I am a member of a small group-- explorers like you, but we seek out challenges, problems to be solved-- technological, biological, social, even artistic. A think tank. I like that. It's very... apt. Our "Think Tank" is nearby. A modest vessel. I have come to offer our help with your Hazari paradox. "Paradox"? That is right. is it an escape route or is it a trap? Do they know that you know that they know? It is the best kind of puzzle-- pure tactics, psychology. Something tells me your help comes with a price tag. Whatever your culture has to offer that is unique. Technology perhaps, or maybe something you would not even think to value. I would need a closer look at your database. And how do I know you aren't an Hazari trap? Maybe they're trying to lure us into an ambush like before. You are wise to be suspicious, Captain. We have done some preliminary analysis on their maneuvers. It does suggest some more likely ambushes. I've downloaded the data onto your computer. All right. You've got my attention, but I want to meet you face-to-face and the rest of your crew. Naturally. Our coordinates are in here, too, but we have our own security concerns, Captain. Please bring only one crewman and no scanning equipment. Fair enough. Then, I look forward to meeting you... in person. We're approaching the coordinates. Full stop. Looks like there's nothing here. Maybe they're cloaked. I'm reading a subspace flux. The vessel's hull is composed of a neutronium-based alloy. Starfleet's theorized about such materials, but we've never come close to producing them. Neither have the Borg. The Think Tank's technology is advanced. Well, you and I will have a chance to evaluate it firsthand. Mr. Kim, you have the transport coordinates. The universal translator must be inoperative. Or his speech patterns are too complex to process. They must be studying it. Actually, she is studying you. Our resident expert on temporal physics. Perhaps the most gifted member of our group. She finds you interesting. How do you communicate? One of my most gifted crewmen, Seven of Nine. Bionetic implants... neural transceivers? A Borg? I've never seen one outside the collective. I am an individual now. You may address your comments to me. Forgive me. I am Kurros and this is Fennim. In answer to your earlier question, this device allows the members of our group to communicate telepathically. Impressive. It sounds as if another member of our crew is anxious to meet you. A bioplasmic life-form. His name is Bevvox. He prefers a variable-gravity environment. What's his specialty? At the moment, exo-sociology and quantum mechanics, but his interests vary from time to time. Bevvox founded our group more than 100 years ago, after wandering the galaxy on his own for a few millennia. How old is this creature? If you please, that is a sensitive topic with him. And there is one other... individual who rounds out our group. An artificial intelligence. The mind of a mathematician and the soul of an artist. I'm afraid he'd much rather be modeling a fractal sculpture, than analyzing the data of our latest astronomical scan. And now you have met us all. A small group of minds, but we have helped hundreds of clients. We turned the tide in the war between the Bara Plenum and the Motali Empire, reignited the Red Giants of the Zai Cluster. Just recently, we found a cure for the Vidiian phage. The Vidiians? You would hardly recognize them now. Just last month, we helped retrieve a Lyridian child's runaway pet-- a subspace mesomorph, I might add. We had to invent a whole new scanning technology just to find it. And what did you ask for as compensation? One of their transgalactic star charts-- the best map of the known galaxy ever created. When we helped the citizens of Rivos V resist the Borg, all we asked for was the recipe for their famous zoth-nut soup. Care for a taste? Another time, perhaps. Tell me, is there any job you won't do? What do you mean? Well, we have a non-interference protocol-- our Prime Directive. I'm curious where you draw the line. As you know, there is no shortage of conflict in what you call the Delta Quadrant. Many of our clients are at war. To be frank, we will assist in the neutralization of fleets, starbases, even planets, but we will not participate in the decimation of an entire species, nor will we design weapons of mass destruction. Hmm. My colleague here wishes to speak to Seven of Nine about her bionetic technology. May he interface with you? I am in direct telepathic communication with this... individual. It is requesting information about integrating organic components into its technology. Feel free to give him some pointers. You're welcome. To business, Captain. I believe we can solve the Hazari paradox without firing a single weapon. That's just what I'm looking for. Then there is only the matter of payment. Voyager's schematics and an overview of its database. Specify what you want and I'll see what I can do. I recommend the replicators. They're very popular this year. I'll contact you with our requests. I take it first contact was a success? I have some qualms about their morality, but I believe they can help us. It was an interesting experience. Glad to hear it. We don't have much good news of our own. Every escape route we've considered is clearly a trap and more Hazari ships keep joining the search. Then we have no choice. We'll put our own plans on hold and see what the Think Tank comes up with. Come in. You have a visitor. Mr. Kurros has returned in isomorphic form. Send him in. Welcome back. Captain, we have compiled a short list of items we would like. It was not easy. Voyager has a great deal to offer. "Quantum slipstream technology." I should warn you. We never got that to work reliably. It is still intriguing, theoretically. "Neelix's recipe for chadre'kab?" Yes. "An ancient Olmec figurine." I guess Commander Chakotay could be persuaded to part with it. I'm pleased to hear that. You can't be serious. I realize the next item may seem unorthodox, but I believe it can be beneficial to both of us. You never mentioned anything about bartering my crew members. She will have an extraordinary opportunity to explore the galaxy as one of us. I'm afraid the answer is no. I understand your feelings, Captain, but... have you thought to ask Seven of Nine herself? A curious proposition. To say the least. How do you wish to proceed? I want your opinion. They are offering us the assistance we require. I am the payment they require. The solution is obvious. This isn't a puzzle, Seven. There's no "solution." What's at issue here is your future. The issue is Voyager's survival. Sit. Please. While I still question this Think Tank's way of doing things, there is a genuine opportunity for exploration. It could be the chance of a lifetime. You're saying I should go? I don't want you to go, but it's not my right to tell you what to do. Until now, I've kept a close eye on your progress, helped you with decisions, but I think you've learned enough as an individual to make this decision yourself. Would you like to join them? I am intrigued. They are an unusual collective with a compelling mission, but I require more data. That's why I want you to talk to Kurros yourself. See if he can answer your questions. Captain... I appreciate your giving me this choice. You've earned it. And remember-- if you do choose to go... make sure it's what you want... not what you think is best for Voyager. We're getting out of this-- with or without the Think Tank's help. Why me? I admire your humility. The collective knowledge of the Borg contained within a single mind. When we factor in your innate intelligence and the enhancements afforded you by your bionetic implants, we concluded you are an ideal candidate... the first we have recruited in 17 years. When did you arrive at this assessment? During your... interview. My dialogue with the artificial intelligence. It was the most efficient way to evaluate your abilities. I am sure you can appreciate that. How much do you know about me? Enough to know that you are tapping into only a fraction of your potential as a member of Voyager's crew. You were adjusting the deflector array to improve shield harmonics. Do you find such duties challenging? No. Without problems that test the limits of your abilities, you cannot expand them. Perfection will always be beyond your reach. Seven of Nine, you could become one of the greatest intellects in the galaxy, but that will not happen here among these limited life-forms. The crew of Voyager has accepted me... integrated me into their collective. integrated me into their collective. They are your family. It was hard for me to leave my family, too... and I was only a child... not much older than you when you were first assimilated. Why did you leave? To help them-- and my world-- solve a cataclysmic problem. The Think Tank requested you as payment? I did not realize it at first-- l was too young-- but they gave me a remarkable opportunity, and now I am offering the same to you. Your group can assist many collectives, and yet you often use that ability as a means of coercion to obtain what you want. How many have suffered because they were unwilling to agree to your conditions? We have a singular mission-- to perfect our knowledge. Perfection sometimes necessitates selfishness. It is your life... not Voyager's, not Captain Janeway's or anyone else's. It is up to you to achieve the goals you have set for yourself. I agree. But I can do that here. Please, take more time to think about this. We will remain nearby in case you change your mind. I doubt that will happen. Seven of Nine, report to the Bridge. Acknowledged. May I accompany you? As you wish. Do you have a problem, Captain? Two Hazari ships are approaching. I have declined their offer. Our first offer. Glad you're sticking around. Take your station. They are dropping out of warp, flanking our position. Which one fired? The ship to starboard. Shields down to 60 percent. Evasive maneuvers. Target their weapon systems and return fire. Their shields are holding. I can't get away. They're right on top of us. Hull integrity's been compromised on Decks 7 and 12. Captain, when the Hazari strike in pairs, one ship always remains behind to reinforce the shields of the attacking vessel. So we should target the support ship. How much is this tip going to cost me? This one is free. I'll take it. Tuvok... Retargeting. Firing photon torpedoes. They are disengaging. Get us out of here-- maximum warp. Thanks for the help. Consider it a friendly gesture of good will in the hopes that Seven will change her mind. I have not. You are making a fatal mistake. We have already analyzed hundreds of scenarios. Voyager will not survive without our help. Your scenarios, not mine. Your confidence is unfounded, Captain. Reconsider. Order Seven of Nine to join us. We have an old expression, Kurros-- "Don't call us. We'll call you." Remodulate the shields to a phase-variant frequency. His ship is vanishing from sensors. It's being absorbed into subspace. I get the distinct feeling they won't take no for an answer. Same here. Looks like we're facing two threats now-- the Hazari... and our would-be saviors. Our offer was denied. How shall we proceed? We are already proceeding. Our offer was refused. We must let the scenario continue. Our calculations indicate a 96 percent chance the Borg will still be ours. Then it is decided. We will wait... and let our problem... solve itself. Duranium hull fragments, a thruster assembly, human organic residue... We were supposed to disable their ship, not destroy it! They've entered the debris field. Detonate the spatial charges. Their vessel has taken heavy damage. Shields and weapons are off-line. Move us into position. Lock on a tractor beam and pull them into the shuttlebay. We're in transporter range. I've got a lock. Two life-forms. Energize. Any luck? I'm still trying to access their primary database. Let me guess. They're the strong but silent types. Very silent. Did you try a mind-meld? Without success. They're unusually resistant. Well, hold off on the torture till we see what we can dig up here. I found something. A series of encoded transmissions. They've been discussing Voyager-- our coordinates, our defenses. Whoever hired the Hazari know a lot about us. Check their sensor logs. See if they had any visitors recently. I've got some bio-readings, but they're pretty scrambled. If they are bio-readings, perhaps the Doctor can unscramble them. Tell him to give it a try. I've created a forensic reconstruction from the bio-readings, using the holo-emitters. Brace yourselves. Malon. Huh... they must really hold a grudge. We haven't run into them for months. I'm sorry, Doctor. Something doesn't feel right. The Malon are economically motivated. And there's no profit in revenge. Take a look at this. isomorphic signatures embedded in the bio-readings. This was no Malon. It was only a projection. You mean that's a hologram... of a hologram? In a manner of speaking. I believe I can restore the original bio-signal parameters. Brace yourself. Well, it appears our Hazari paradox is more complex than we thought. I believe we're both being manipulated by the same person. Recognize him? No. His name is Kurros. The Malon you met with was nothing more than a projection. My sensors would have detected a hologram. Not this one. Kurros is a member of a... Think Tank. They solve problems for a price. Oh, you have heard of them. They're notorious in this sector. They've made quite a few enemies. Enemies who might be willing to pay a hell of a bounty. Their technology is very advanced. Makes them difficult to track. Not if we work together. You're the best hunters in the Quadrant and we have the perfect lure. All we have to do now is... outthink the Think Tank. We've got a puzzle, and we're not leaving this room until we solve it. The Think Tank is out there somewhere, hiding in subspace. How do we find them? And even if we can, their ship's hull is neutronium-based alloy, impervious to our weapons. How do we capture them? What if we send out a multispatial probe? It would take weeks of scanning to find them. Weeks? We're not willing to wait that long. We could use subspatial charges to force them into the open. Where do we target the charges? We've still got to find them first. Maybe we're going about this the wrong way. A direct assault seems unlikely to succeed. "Pure tactics, psychology..." that's how they solve problems. That's what we have to do. They've created this paradox to manipulate us into giving them Seven of Nine. How do we manipulate them? Think. I thought we were onto something with B'Elanna's plan to... Forget it. I was wrong. Let him talk. We're talking in circles. Enough! Three hours, no progress. I should have contacted my ships by now. Maybe we can't outthink them. Captain? We have to assume they've planned for every contingency, including anything we could come up with to undermine their plan. This thing has been driving me crazy. You said you knew the solution. Prove it. Seven, how'd you do that? I scanned the device. Its mechanism operates on a simple fractal regression. You scanned it? That's cheating. Cheating is often more efficient. If you can't solve a puzzle, cheat. If you can't outthink a Think Tank, don't try. Are you suggesting we give up? Not at all. When you were in contact with the artificial intelligence, you were linked through their internal communications array. Yes, for several seconds. If you were to link with them again, we might be able to disrupt those systems. If they can't communicate, they can't function as a Think Tank. They'd be vulnerable. Back to square one-- how do we find them? Simple. We give them what they want. You're going to join their group willingly. They won't believe her. We'll have to make them believe. Pull up a chair. We've got some more work to do. An Hazari vessel is sending hails into subspace. It's trying to contact us. Put them through. They're responding. Hazari vessel, we have received your halls. Can we be of assistance? You deceived us. I do not believe we have met. Stop the pretense. You wanted us to deliver Voyager. Very well, but only if you triple our bounty. My friend, regardless of the circumstances, we have a contract. Pay us, or we let Voyager go. All right. We will triple the bounty, but you must deliver them to us... now. Agreed. We'll contact the rest of our ships. We'll seize Voyager as planned. Shields down to 30 percent. Return fire. Our phasers aren't penetrating their shields. That last volley took out our shield generators and phaser banks. Life support's failing, all decks. Let us be honest, Captain. Things do not seem to be going your way. Don't count us out just yet. I admit you have been clever. You uncovered our subterfuge, but you failed to factor in all the variables. The greed of the Hazari, for example. Photon torpedoes? Aft launchers are still on line. Target a full spread at the lead Hazari ship. A few torpedoes will not alter the outcome. If you do not convince Seven of Nine to join us now, the destruction of your ship is 99.8 percent certain. Fire. Direct hit. It's been disabled. Clinging to that .2 percentage? Hazari reinforcements should be here any minute. He's right. Sensors just picked up a half dozen ships on an intercept course. Captain, I'm detecting an unauthorized shuttle launch. It's Seven of Nine. What the hell is she doing? I believe she's saving your ship. She's not answering hails. Her shuttle's being pulled into subspace. She's gone. Have a safe journey home... Captain. Seven of Nine, welcome. Your hospitality is irrelevant. I am here because you left me no choice. You gave in to your human instincts to save your crew, as we knew you would. Just another factor in our equation. If Voyager is destroyed, I will not cooperate. Do not worry. The solution to the Hazari paradox is quite simple. We have what we want. Call off your attack. Not until we've been compensated. Fine. But first order your other vessels to stand down. Now, or we'll destroy Voyager. Why is he in such a hurry? Comply. If we de-cloak, we would be vulnerable. The Hazari could make quite a bounty on us... far more than we are paying them. Their technology is inferior to yours. They would never attack you directly. I think this is a trap-- a new paradox your Captain has created for us. If we call their bluff, the Hazari might destroy Voyager and we would lose you. If we reveal ourselves, we could be destroyed. You told me, "without problems "to test the limits of your ability, you can never expand them." There is one very simple way to narrow the odds. We simply link you to our communications system, allow our artificial intelligence to probe your mind as it did before, and Captain Janeway's plans will be revealed like a jewel in a bed of fog. Sick Bay to Bridge. Seven's neural transceiver has been activated. Acknowledged. Do it. I'm transmitting the carrier wave. Voyager is sending an interference signal into our systems using her cortical implants as a relay. Disconnect the link. Disconnect the link. They can't understand you. Voyager to Hazari vessels. Their systems are down. Fire the spatial charges. We seem to be experiencing some turbulence. Primitive spatial charges. I will have the dome back on line before they can do any damage. We're being pulled out of subspace. I've got a lock on Seven. lnitiate transport. The Hazari vessels are converging on the Think Tank. Tom. Setting a course. I urge you to reconsider, Captain. A good guest knows when he's outstayed his welcome. We can still negotiate a peaceful solution. Do not destroy my faith in diplomacy. Your diplomacy could use some polishing. You know you will never be satisfied here, among these people. is this what you really want? Acquiring knowledge is a worthy objective, but its pursuit has obviously not elevated you. Looks like your ship's having difficulties. A minor problem. Oh, I'm sure you'll find a solution.

Previously on Gene Roddenberry's Earth Final Conflict: Doors International has formed a new alliance with the Taelons. The real work will be in the capable hands of my new division head, Renee Palmer. Still wondering if you can trust me, huh? Trust doesn't come that easy these days. This skrill will become an appendage of your central nervous system. This life form, you reengineered it and turned it into a weapon? The genesis of the skrill lies in the work of human bioengineers. You're a volunteer! Loyalty means everything! You give your commitment to the Taelons, they give you back even more. - Are you ready to die for them? - Yes, sir! - Are you ready to kill for them? - Yes, sir! Can I help you? We had a few complaints. Earth Abides is in violation of the President's state of emergency. That's crazy. And anyway the state of emergency's been lifted. That's true, sir. The fact remains that certain police powers are reserved for dealing with Resistance cells. Resistance cells? We got absolutely nothing to do with the Resistance. It's not what our sources say. Earth Abides has a long history of questioning Companions' motives. That's what they call the free speech. That's supposed to be funny? - You think you can laugh this off? - I'm not laughing. What are they doing? - Looking for evidence of sedition. - We'll see about that. Name and unit ID, please. Absolutely. This is my name. And this is my unit ID. Any other questions? Subtitled by Axarion They have come to Earth with the promise of peace. An alien race called the Taelons. But, there are those who resist these Alien Companions. For the Taelons' true mission, the secrets they hide will forever alter our world. The fate of humanity now relies on those who dare challenge the future of Earth. And look at this place! You have any idea how much is it gonna cost to fix that window? - They destroyed the entire database. - Calm down. You don't calm down, I cannot help you, sir. I'm telling you we're gonna sue the Taelons for harassment. - We... - Those fascist pigs just stroll in here and then she tears the place apart with this creepy thing on her arm! Like this? - Are you sure? - Absolutely, man. She blasts the place! Bam! Bam! Bam! Glass everywhere. And I was sure I was next. What did they look like? I've got the holo-composite descriptions. We'll get back to you. - You alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. It's okay, I've ordered for both of us. I'm on duty. You said you needed to speak to me in person and fast. Absolutely. What's the story with this skrill incident? I'm on the case. Why are you so thrilled about it? Well, the way I see it, the more people they harass, the more friends the Resistance makes. Life should be that simple. Well, let me make it even simpler. I thought only volunteer officers were armed with skrills, and their CVI is needed to make the blast. So? So, where does someone get a skrill that works without a CVI? What are you getting at? Well, you being so cozy with the Taelons and all, I thought maybe you could get your hands on one of these user-friendly skrills. Right now the most important thing is getting these thugs off the street. This meeting... is a waste of my time. The house on Hammond, 16th foreclosed by bank. What? If payment isn't made to Metro Reserve Bank by close-up business today, the same thing will happen to rental property on Carter Circle. What do you suggest? Make a guaranteed payment by the close-up business today. I get that, but where's the money supposed to come from? Enough with that "tsk-tsk" already. What can I do? Your stock portfolio evaporated in the post-emergency correction. That was no correction, that was a crash. So, it's either rob a bank, or sell of the rest of your collection. Then, hope all your creditors die in the same accident leaving no heirs. Look, I don't need comedy, I need real solutions. Solutions to what? Nothing, just watching myself go broke in a rapid clip. Anything I can do? You? You! You're part of the problem. Thanks to you, I bought into the romance of the Resistance, and ignored Augur Inc. And now I'm paying for it. You know, I've had to unload nearly every property I owned just to cover the costs of playing the revolutionary. And the thing about revolution is if you don't win there's no one around to pay for the cost of the war. - Sorry, Augur... - You know, I had to sell my collection... piece by piece and I still hemorrhaging. Come on, Augur, you'll be fine. Now, what do you know about a political party called Earth Abides? Why would the volunteers be going after them? Could Earth Abides be a cover for an unaligned Resistance cell? Maybe I have to paint you a picture, Liam. I'm not playing anymore! What? The Resistance isn't my fight, it never was my fight. It was just another expensive videogame. - Oh, I understand. - You don't understand a thing! Look at you! You walk in here, you don't even ask, "Hey, Augur, how is it going?" "What happened to your paintings, Augur?" If you don't mind, I'd like to be by myself while my life goes down the toilet. And what am I supposed to do? You're a big boy now. You figure it out. You lost another 40 thousand of mutual funds while I was away. Can I assume, Agent Sandoval, that you have been less than successful in your search for these rogue volunteers? Every volunteer's whereabouts at the time of the incident has been accounted for. And the insignia. There's no resemblance to any unit I'm aware of. I promise you, Zo'or, we'll get to the bottom of this. With haste. I am troubled by the negative public reaction this incident has generated. It was a slow news day. You okay, Sylvia? - I'm fine. - Yeah? Looked like it really hurt when you used that thing. I said I'm fine. If you can't take the heat, stay out of the revolution. Once we're done, we're all gonna be armed with one of these things. Whether you like it or not. Hey, you seen that little geek's face when you blasted the computer? He must've wet himself. This is the way we radicalize these cowards and then blame it on the Taelons. Everything's okay. Good. We're not getting anywhere in this investigation. Sandoval seems to be hitting the same blank walls I am. This is why Agent Sandoval wants to see us at the Skrill Center. It is here that the skrills are birthed. Then genetically reengineered into weapons. I tracked every volunteer in the unit. Everyone was accounted for at the time of skrilling, so it appears we're dealing with imposters. Then I learned of a security breach. We found a gap in the security video, and discovered there's been a theft of a new skrill prototype. How are these impostors able to use a skrill without a CVI? We've created an experimental skrill designed to bond without a CVI. And that's all that was stolen? As I said, it was a prototype. There was only one to steal. When we last spoke you indicated that you and your staff had not yet found a solution to the neural problem. I'm afraid that's so. The skrill prototype will function without a CVI, but it takes an enormous toll on the host's nervous system. - What sort of toll? - We don't know exactly. What's this? That's the skrill queen. The only one of its kind. Every skrill in service's her child. She's pulsing. We keep her permanently pregnant. Now, this seems worth stealing. A single skrill, even an experimental prototype, seems small reward for breaking in here. Stealing the queen and keeping her alive is impossible. Is the shifting color a symptom of her pregnancy? On the extreme right she seems slightly bluer. What precisely are you saying, Liam? We've got a problem bigger than the theft of the prototype. - Kincaid, what the hell are you doing? - Major, stop, you'll kill her! - Major! - It's a hologram. Some one's stolen the skrill queen. I have a feeling that anybody good enough to pull this off wouldn't leave any incriminating evidence. And I have a feeling the thief if still here. An inside job does seem likely. Yes, which makes Dr. Lindford or someone on her staff the likely a suspect. I need a complete list of your staff. - My staff could never... - Dr. Lindford... You've told us stealing the queen was impossible. Your track record leaves a lot to be desired. Zo'or? I require you on the bridge in 15 minutes, Agent Sandoval. Problem, Agent Sandoval? These are the holos of the three who vandalized Earth Abides. They could be anybody. So, these imposters stole the mother of all skrills? My guess is that it's a Resistance group trying make the volunteers and the Taelons look bad. More power to them. Why do I get the feeling you know who they are? I don't know. Why do you? Look, even if this theory of yours held water no one's gonna believe it. Wait till someone gets hurt. Come on, Joe 6-Pack will never believe that a Resistance cell could pull this off and denials for the Taelons would be read as disinformation. Oh, one more thing, this prototype apparently causes nerve damage to the user. And where did you get this little piece of news? Da'an and Dr. Lindford. The woman who runs the Skrill Development Center. See my earlier remark about Taelon disinformation. Where are you heading? Not that it's any of your business, but I have a date. Oh, you wouldn't by any chance be planning to find these guys, would you? Ooh, you've got a suspicious soul. And you lie for a living. Must be awful to be so paranoid. Perhaps you do not grasp the urgency of this situation. The skrill arsenal is in jeopardy. If you do not recover the queen, one of our most powerful weapons will be eliminated. I understand completely, Zo'or. I have placed Dr. Lindford under arrest. My understanding is that only a scientist could've stolen the queen with any hope of birthing the litter. Assuming, of course, that the queen is still alive. Traitors found the holographic. So, the Taelons know we've got her? And they know it's inside job. What happens when they find out who infiltrated the skrill lab? Don't worry about what you can't control. I made some enquiries. Sounds like Black Wednesday. Come on, Renee, everyone knows Black Wednesday is a straw man invented by the Taelons. Wrong. Black Wednesday is for real. The Taelons landed on Wednesday. I was at the meeting the day after when the Resistance was founded. You were there? I've been Resistance since the day one. And there isn't a Resistance cadre as hard core as Black Wednesday. And there's no more committed anti-Taelon, than Sylvia Ehrengraf. So, you did recognize her yesterday. And you did try to go out and find her on your own. She's changed her hair. And those holos are based on the descriptions anyway, but that's Sylvia. One thing's for sure though, she may have changed her looks a little, but she's still a sociopath with an unyielding belief in her mission. Terrific. She's nuts. But she's got something the Resistance desperately needs. The skrill queen. We gotta brig them in, before the Taelons get them. And before the skrill kills her. So, I guess, we have to at least try to work together. I'm afraid we're gonna have to ask you to come with us, Mr. Dinesen. I'm not sure I understand. Your organization is being charged with sedition against the Taelons. You call questioning these creatures' agenda a sedition? I'm afraid so. We'd like you to come with us. Of course. Until we bring in these impostors to justice no one's gonna believe the Taelons are innocent. You're getting anywhere? I followed all what I've got from an informant. Sounds like this is the work of a fringe group that's more criminal the revolutionary. Any of that tied to this Dr. Lindford? Well, she's on the mailing list of a number of organizations that question the Taelon agenda. Come on, that describes half the people we both know. You're on those mailing lists. For entirely different reasons. I've got Dr. Lindford up on the mother ship. Discussion over, Major. Next. Now, assuming they are the same perps, they might have travelled by portal, which means their identities are buried in a portal database. I'll hit the portal Authority, check for anyone travelling with a skrill on a wounded volunteer. And I'll interface with the Bureau on the wounded man's DNA. It was a noble gesture to bring Alan home. But he didn't have a chance. You'll need plastic sheeting and lye to dispose of the body. Sorry I pulled you out. Just a matter of time before they caught up. Time to take a look at the patient. Everything looks good to go here. If something should happen to me you've got to continue this work... Nothing's gonna happen to you. Don't forget who upped the ante from kidnapping to homicide. - If I hadn't we'd all be dead! - No, what I'm trying to say to you... Why don't you let me deal with the combat and you handle your end? - Hey, I'm talking to you. - And I've got work to do. I'm sorry, Noah. I was just... I know. I know. She looks like she's ready to give birth anytime. And, once she does, we're gonna use this one as a model to genetically engineer the litter to blasters. Now, Peter tells me that every time you use the skrill - It seems to hurt you or something... - I told him to shut up about that. Hey, recriminations. He did the right thing by telling me. I told you from the beginning this might be a little too risky. And I told you that if anyone was gonna take any risks, it was gonna be me. Fine. But promise me one thing. You will not use the skrill, until I had a chance to see if I can bypass whatever it is that's causing the pain. Understood? Fine. I promise. But do it soon. When I think of all the hell we can raise with this things... Without the healthy outlet for hate the Taelons give you, I just shudder to think what you'd do for release. What all revolutionaries do. Purge intellectuals like you. Just kidding. It's people like Dr. Lindford who should worry. Oh, a good Doctor... She's gonna have a lot to worry about, once they find what I planted in her files. This is Alan Kelly, the man killed Copenhagen. My people at the Bureau matched his DNA with a participant in the compatibility survey you did for this new skrill prototype. I've never seen this man before in my life. I tell you I'm innocent! Then you have to work with me. I want a list... of the equipment needed to safely bring the queen to term. Is it conceivable, Zo'or, that the loss of the skrill queen was fated. Fated? Perhaps, our subjugation of the skrills has run its course. We conquered the skrills for a purpose. And the will continue to serve that purpose. If you had not taken it upon yourself to institute this project we would not have this problem. A skrill that does not require a CVI is foolhardy. The CVI is no more than a governor on our human allies. Regardless of what you may believe, we will never be able to bioengineer humans as we have the skrills. Your cloyingly sentimental feelings for the humans are insipid. We can do whatever we choose. And we will. Yeah, I admit I was wrong, but the victim did fire first. That doesn't diminish the fact that they've crossed the line. And that we've got to bring them in before there are more killings. Alright. We're are you, anyway? Portal Authority. Going over DC-Copenhagen records. Well, good luck. Ah, I'm trying another tac. I'll see you later. We should get some sleep. Yeah. Aah! Damn it! And he's a good trapper. [squawking noise] We can expect a quick response ifhe hearsthat. Adultcrocswill move on distressed hatchlings. Again, I don'tmean to be annoying with myquestions but if it is a crocodile, which I don'tthink it is, and theydo chargethese baby hatchling sounds, whywouldyou wantto be underwateratthetime? Withyou, itmakes sense. You see, Sheriff, thething is, theydon't really attack underwater. ThatWaltguy got hit underwater. True.Theydon'tsee thatwell underwater. They have nictitating lenses on theireyes... Burke, stop here. - Now? -Yeah. ...You dive underwater and they probablywon't be ableto seeyou. Wells: I hateto interrupt butwe gotworkto do. Hey,we can talk ifwewant. Yeah,we can talk ifwewant. Wouldyou mind putting down the anchor? Waittill we're down there beforeyou turn thatthing on. Got it. Let's go, Hector. Good luck. I broughta porkchop for luck. Maybeyou can hang it aroundyou neck. That's sweet. Maybe lateryou can chewthe bark offmy big,fat log. Wasthat, like, a homosexual remark? Don'taskme.
