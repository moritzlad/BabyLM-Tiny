actually er there's a kind of, there's an inner feeling you know well we've got the right computers, we, we're the you know, we, we believe computing and we, we're very sorry you know we're erm we may not actively despise them, but we, we're sorry that they have to bother with such an awful operating system and everything else. So there's a kind of feeling, and this happens in all groups doesn't it that, that a group to which one's which one identifies, there's a kind of feeling erm you know, we're, we're the members and there's something special about us and er at the best we're sorry for the non-members, we'd like to have more of them and so we might proselytize and preach the gospel, you know you know throw away your idioms, become or in the worst possible way we might be an exclusive group and say we are, we are erm special, we are we, we know the truth and everybody else is infidels and you know they should be killed or driven out or or in some ways discriminated against because they're wrong and we're right. Because we're right we're we, we're, we're better people as a result, so th th there's a tendency just as in individuals can get proud and even arrogant and self-satisfied, so does the tendency for groups to get proud, arrogant and self-satisfied because and what fuels this group erm feeling is narcissism. It's not the heterosexual strand of the libido because there of course there is a problem. As far as heterosexual object libido is concerned, three is a crowd and two is ideal. Two's company, three's a crowd, but when you're talking about this generalized and more desexualized supplemented narcissistic libido to do with ego, then of course three is not a crowd in fact three erm is, is, er is the is er just as easy to accommodate as three thousand or three million, because it's, it can be channelled into the group. However, how does that come about, I mean if supposing you were a, a member of a very large group like the Catholic Church getting on to a billion people say, well you can't possibly identify with a billion other people you can't meet them in one lifetime let alone ties with them, so how does, how does narcissistic libido unify the members of vast groups like the Catholic Church? How does it actually come about, because you couldn't meet the majority of in a lifetime. Everyone can Right. shared value. The, as, as, as, as, as you both say the, the narcissistic libido of the individual is concerned initially with their own ego. The, the group usually has a leader or symbols which represent its aspirations like the statue of the Virgin Mary or, or Golden Churches or something to which act as representatives or icons for the aspirations, the ideals of the individual's ego and every member of the group shares those, that leader or those icons or those ideals and consequently the group is unified by a kind of sentry petal flow of individual narcissistic libido towards the centre, towards the leader and that makes them more identifiable with each other. So that the erm we really are again and this is what this diagram in Freud's book is supposed to illustrate that the, the erm every every individual ego has its own ego ideal and objects external objects like erm say the Pope can become the focus of this erm individualistic narcissistic libido because every individual identifies the Pope with their own ego ideal. So every Catholic feels an identification with every other Catholic because they've got a considerable aerial overlap in their, in their ego ideals and er narcissistic libido is directed towards the central focus. So it's not as, it, it's erm uniformly spread everywhere in the first place, it's directed first at the focus and then when you meet another person whom you realize has the same ego ideal, then you identify them, with them by a kind of secondary erm secondary identification. What about Well. Well, well his parents I mean the extreme Protestants are, are on the rise I mean in South America you know I mean the world's largest Pentecostal Churches are in Lima and Peru and millions are now becoming erm born-again Christians in South America. Erm so erm but of course I mean t to make the point because it doesn't really contradict what you're saying Heather because of course the rather more extreme kinds of Protestant Sects that do emphasise for example erm er narrow dogmatic teaching much more so you could say that erm and I think this would perhaps be the answer to, to Oliver's point to some extent because it goes back to Dean's original point that erm here we're we we're talking about a general theory of groups, but of course some groups can be more groupie than others. Some groups can be more individualistic where the individual identifies less strongly, there are fewer icons, there's less erm dogmatic er certainty about doctrine and so on, so more room for an individual variation and those groups will be relatively er looser and there would be less identification of the individual with the leader or the leading principals. Other groups however, possibly smaller ones or more erm or, or more er or ones that are kind of more fired up with er,wi wi with with feelings of group membership, you find the opposite, you find stronger identifications, more emphasis on leaders and consequently followers. So, so what we're talking, we're not saying you know there are groups and there're individuals and there's a gap in between, what we're saying is there's a kind of continuum from very groupie groups where the individual is, is practically hypnotized by the, by, by, by, by the group to erm more or less complete individualism where individuals belong to, to emotional groups that are very, very weak and where identification with the with the sentries is pretty pretty minimal. erm you know like for instance I mean erm I mean I suppose I feel British but I mean I don't feel I have any very strong identification with with other British people because there are so many other people in the world speak English and erm often people from other countries who in many ways you identify with them more. So, but still I suppose I have some residual identification with, with my own ethnic national group. it's not one that will inspire me with erm with, with great kind of nationalistic fervour as might have happened in the past when, when you look at nationalistic movements, so erm presumably we're looking at a range of behaviour which goes from extreme fanatical group membership to relatively weak identification with a group but really doesn't to anything else but saying you know if you ask me what I'll say I was British. Well that doesn't mean very much. Does that answer your question? So we know, we should and remember of course that in the book Freud chooses two examples as Joy told me the church and the army and these are just examples and of course Freud chooses them partly because they're very big groups so they in some ways they er exemplify the principles he's talking about because clearly in a small group like this you could say well look, what is going on is really I mean we all have, we all know each other and it's a face-to-face group and really what happens here is an of the dynamics group and I think it is actually. For example one notices over many years of you know having teaching I must have taught hundreds now in different class groups, can't help noticing that although you're the same, subject is the same, the syllabus is the same, the reading list is the same, the room is the same, the time of day may be the same, but the groups are completely different. Some classes erm go with a buzz and everybody gets a lot out of it you think you know oh that was that was worthwhile, we achieved something. Other classes struggle all the time, to get anything done you feel you know why are we having this class, we're not making erm it's not making a lot of educational sense and one comes to the conclusion after many years of bitter experience that it personal dynamics, it depends on who's in the group and some groups erm this one successful and some groups which I won't mention are relatively unsuccessful and one feels okay that's because of the inter-personal, it's who's in the group and how they interact with each other and try as one might, I suppose I play th the leading role in this group try as one might, one can't change the group, but, but clearly these are not th the examples that Freud chooses are really big groups where the kind of factors he's talking about comes through very clearly because y y you cannot explain what happens in the Catholic Church or an army. so he chooses the examples he does to illustrate his, his theory and of course he's chosen inevitably good examples. Well, yes sorry perhaps I myself. I meant not in the same way. at the end of the day there must be something Oh I'm sure that's true. Yes now what I meant was that, that erm in a group like this, the the th th the leader or the leadership role may be relatively minimal and the individualism of the members may be relevant, but I hope it was cos I I think it's a mistake for class in groups and that so one would hope in this kind of group, the individual variation would be so important that these kind of group phenomena that Freud is talking about in this book but clearly in other groups they're they're more important, partly because you can never organize a group by kind of having a meeting with everybody. I mean you couldn't have a meeting with the whole Catholic Church for example to decide on doctrine. So what happens of course in an institution like that is the the leaders define the doctrine congregation for the doctrine of the faith, lays down the doctrine of the faith and then the believers are then obliged to believe it. The followers a a are obliged to believe it and so the faith, the creed of the Catholic Church then becomes an article of membership and if you don't subscribe to the creed, then this has implications for your standing in the group and you can for example be persecuted and Catholics not believing, whereas in a group like this, I don't think we need a creed, we certainly wouldn't persecute anybody because we didn't believe a particular thing, because we can all negotiate our personal relations face- to-face. Do you see, that's what I meant by it. Yeah, this is just Mm. Oh, it does, oh it does yes. Oh, this, this is a very important book of course and one of the, one of the astonishing things is the way totally ignored and if you look through even people who write about psychoanalyses and the social sciences and there's a lot of them, this book is hardly ever mentioned and I, I normally nowadays routinely look for it in the, in the references and index an and many books th that purport to talk about groups and sociology is never mentioned I think, and those that do don't ever seem to understand what it says. An astonishing fact. Well look folks we'll have to stop now it's gone eleven and I have to give a lecture Joy, er that was an excellent er summary, well done. As I said I'll be talking about this in the next couple of weeks in the lectures and I hope to cover various things we didn't have time to touch on. Next week we're being entertained by Heather. Now. Oh, first thing is last week's summary. Let me pass that round. Just pass that round, that's last week's summary. Today's lecture is on erm what you might call female interest in sex and in particular in in the concept of erm female choice and I was struck er this morning by looking at Nature. Nature of course as you know is the world's leading science journal and er I have to read Nature every week. The reason why of course and I take this as a matter of pride because er not only am I, I think probably the only member of the L S E as published in Nature recently, but erm er the other thing I take pride in is the fact that erm one really can't ignore it, because all the time stuff is being published in the world's leading science journal which is directly relevant to this course and how many other courses are in L S E are like that? For example a couple of weeks ago there was a thing on tit for tat and this week there's a fascinating thing on snakes and female sexuality which erm illustrates er some of the points I'll be, I'll, I'll be making and although as Sue rightly says erm, most of the articles in Nature are rather technical and difficult to understand if you're not a specialist they do make concessions to the rest of us by publishing very often erm summaries er in the first part of the journal erm and there is one on this and er I can recommend that. In fact I'll, I'll Xerox it and pass it round if people are interested. I also find Yeah. Yeah. Alright, I, I borrowed this one from the Senior Common Room. But it is in the library, it's in the library erm every week, so m my, you know you can get it down the down the library. Oh no, I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend anything to. I mean it's far too technical an and I, I, I wouldn't either, but erm it's er as I said, it's just er it was struck me as coincidentally since I was talking about this, this today. Okay now you remember I said that the key concept in our modern understanding of sex and sexual behaviour . One of the virtues of parental investment er theory I would say is that er it's particularly sensitive to female interests in, in in sexuality and nobody who knows me or has read er my works would, could possibly suspect me here of fashionable feminist prejudices er so I don't say this because I think this is what people like to hear, but because I happen to think it's true, I'm afraid I'm one of these old-fashioned and you may think stupid people who believe that you should er say things cos you think they're true, not because you think er it's what you think want w want to hear or if you say it, you'll be accused of sexual harassment by a lecturer as I was last year. Erm the daring to the daring to say things which I did, did think were true, but I knew were true because many of them were facts. Erm the reason why parental investment theory is is particularly sensitive to, to the female point of view of course is as we've seen one of the fundamental consequence of anisogamy is the fact that females normally invest more in offspring than do males, whereas males concentrate on mating success normally, females normally concentrate on erm parental, in individual offspring. So the divorce of sex from reproduction which is erm a very common and even fashionable view in the later twentieth century and of course is one very much facilitated by modern birth control technology and things like that this, this divorce of sex and reproduction is in a way you could say a characteristically male way of looking at things if the male's er contribution to offspring doesn't go much further than the initial fertilization. For males sex may be very important, but for females reproduction may be, may be more significant if it involves as it does in the case of all mammals and certainly human beings, considerable parental investment on the part of the mother. So I think that er to put parental investment theory centre stage is more reliable and better than the rather old-fashioned biological approach which in talking about sex emphasise things like sex chromosomes and hormones, so that a sex chromosome in a mammal for instance was something that a male had but a female didn't and this gave rise to hormonal effects like those of testosterone erm which are thought to be very important. Well these things may er describe erm sexual behaviour and how to facilitate it, but they can't explain it and nor are they really fundamental, because after all okay in mammals males may be the sex defined by the X chromosome, but in birds it's the other way round in birds it's the female chromosome and all, in other words, all bird embryos start, start out as male and differentiate into females if they're going to, whereas in mammals all embryos start out as female and differentiate into males, in so far as those terms have any sense. So it seems to me that parental investment erm theory is, is much better because not only is it universally applicable, it also explains why the sexes a are, are the way they are in ultimate evolutionary terms and that talk about hormones and sex chromosomes never can do. Now if we took this view about parental investment theory, it would immediately erm concentrate our attention if we're talking about human beings as we are in this course on er one critical factor which er is astonishingly important and that is er body fat. Now you may say well why, why does body fat matter er for female reproductive success and the answer to that if you think about it is pretty easy. A female mammal is if you like erm the egg in in other classes of higher animals a female lays an egg, the egg contains all the nutrients or possibly incubated. In the case of a mammal, the egg is retained within the body so the mother's body is effectively another part of the egg providing it through the placenta with nutrients and so on. So the state of the mother's body is critical for the reproductive success of any implanted egg. This probably explains why menarche the age of which er menstruation begins menarche er why the age of menarche has dropped progressively in the last century from about fifteen and a half to about twelve and a half er today. The reason appearing to be that menarche is weight-triggered and in particular is turned on by er body weight reaching erm a certain proportion I think it's about eighteen percent of weight erm erm represented by body fat triggers, triggers menarche. There is some evidence Sorry, twenty four percent, twenty four percent body weight erm about a quarter in other words when, when a young woman's body is about one quarter fat, she can start menstruating for obvious reasons. There is some residual evidence that daylight length may be a factor and that the invention of electric light has also lowered the age of menarche but this effect is not erm absolutely clear and there's some controversy about it. Most people think if it, if it's, if it's real at all it's er it's much less important than weight. Of course few quantitative studies have been done of this, but those that we have show pretty unmistakable results. A study of the Atchee hunter gatherers in Paraguay show that a woman's body weight was erm directly related to her reproductive success as was her age of menarche in other words the younger the younger menarche and the heavier the woman, the greater her lifetime reproductive success and this again er shouldn't surprise us. Another one of the most er interesting bits of evidence about this is the rate of fraternal twinning. Now as you know, there are two types of twins tha that people can have. You can have fraternal twins, in which case the relatedness is a half and the twins although they were born together result from two def separate eggs, they were separately fertilized. So in other words they were just like any other sibling, just happens to be they were erm conceived at the same time and er developed in the womb together. Identical twins have relatedness R equals one genetic identical every gene in one is represented in the other and they result from a split in a fertilized egg which splits into two and then each develops as if it were,wer were a separate egg. Now the rate of identical twinning erm is remarkably constant which suggests that it, whatever causes it is relatively independent of other factors. Perhaps it's erm some kind of mistake in the way erm cells divide after they've been fertilized, I don't know, but this is not true of fraternal twinning. Studies in Europe for instance show that er in populations which experienced starvation during World War Two such as the Netherlands, the rate of fraternal twinning dropped dramatically during the war, but then recovered to its pre-war level after the war, and this strongly suggests that the rate of fraternal twinning was related to how much food women were eating, and when they were starved they were less likely to two eggs than when they were fell fed. This is an affect well known in some domesticated animals like sheep, it's well known that if sheep are, if, if, if, if ewes are well fed just before they mate, they're much more likely to er to twin than if they're er not given extra food supplement and nowadays erm farmers wh wh who, who breed sheep for lambing er frequently feed, feed ewes a special diet just before er conception for that very reason, the rate of twinning increases. So this again is quite interesting evidence for er for the importance of, of body fat for female reproductive success. Another interesting erm angle on this is, is anorexia nervosa. Anorexia is a relatively modern illness er the first descriptions of it are found in the nineteenth century and today it's er by no means an uncommon illness in er mainly in young women, very occasionally in men, but, but er y it's more or less safe to say it's er it's a disease of er women and almost always younger women. It's hardly ever reported in the Third World and er taking the facts that we've just been talking about into account, it would be tempting to see anorexia as related to conflicts about the beginning of a young woman's reproductive life because what normally happens is, and has certainly happened in the only case of this that occurred in my family, the young woman in question lost so much weight that she stopped cycling and in fact erm puberty changes went into reverse, she actually regressed, she started puberty and er she had this anorexia problem and she stopped cycling and, and all her body changes reversed, she went back to to pre-puberty again erm because of oh no, oh no it didn't, she lost her body hair and stuff yeah, er her, her, her hormonal changes. Mind you, she was starving herself to the point of endangering her life and had to be hospitalized, but er oh no, her hormon her hormon well her hormonal changes went into reverse, they absolutely did. Erm, so it's tempting to see er anorexia as part of this whole picture, because it usually happens in younger women usually at the beginning of their reproductive careers and there is usually, or so therapists report, conflict usually with parents related to things like career, er possible choice of marriage partner which erm create conflict about the young, about the young woman's er future reproductive life. So it would be erm it would seem natural to think that anorexia fits into this picture somewhere. Admittedly the details may be complicated, but erm it, it certainly seems that these, our knowledge about fat and reproductive success may erm throw some light on this. In other words fat issue it's probably an issue. Now erm all this really goes back to eighteen seventy one. As we know er Darwin published his great work in eighteen fifty nine cos he had to, he really didn't want to but was forced, but in eighteen seventy one he published another important book called the Descent of Man or Evolution in Relation to Sex and in this book Darwin established a principle, which a which at the time he was widely criticized and ridiculed and this was the principle of female choice. Essentially what Darwin realized was that sexual dimorphism, particularly where it makes the male spectacularly different from female is not always the outcome of inter-male conflict, very often it is, we saw examples of the films of stags, of erm elephant seals, those kinds of animals where the dimorphic differences appear to be the result of inter-male conflict, for instance elephant seals are seven times heavier, the males are seven times heavier than the females on average because sheer weight is what wins those astonishing battles they have on the beaches when they, they kind of lunge at each other. They have these enormous canine teeth again stabbing each other and the thick blubber round the neck again as a defence and if the canines go in they go into the blubber and not to arteries and stuff like that. So a modern sexual dimorphism is explicable in terms of erm inter-male er conflict and it may be in the case of human beings er most of them are, for example the larger body weight of males that we saw when we looked at sexual dimorphism in human beings is probably explicable erm in terms of inter-male conflict like it is in chimpanzees. Er my guess is that beards may be the same. I don't know what you think about this, but what occurs to me is this, supposing you had to kill somebody with your bare hands, how would you do it?suggestion. You gotta kill me. The obvious thing is to strangle okay? Erm we haven't got anybody here with a beard so we can't demonstrate and anyway it would be a dangerous experiment if we did, but supposing you tried to strangle me and I've got a big beard you know, a kind of Karl Marx style beard well a big beard, er you get your hands round my neck and what can I do? I can do that and if I pull my beard I'm gonna loosen your grip. So my suggestion and this is only a suggestion, the beards which in the past have been interpreted as a kind of erm epigrammatic signal, in other words a kind of erm sign on the face of the male as they're deceived , my guess is that,th that beards may actually have evolved to protect the throat because erm the critical thing in, in killing somebody is to block the, the windpipe and that's and in fact even, even lions do this, you saw in the film when a lion kills an antelope or something, he doesn't go to all the trouble of making horrible gashes, he grabs the, the windpipe and holds on until the antelope or whatever it is is just er Most predators do. It, it Yeah. Yeah. Well perhaps they do that too. Perhaps they do that too unless the canines go each side of the when they squeeze the windpipe. Anyway of course, actually while you mention canine teeth Sue, it's worth pointing out that canine teeth are usually for use, use on other males. Er it's true that hunting animals like for instance er female cats, the cat family, lionesses and we know lionesses do most of the hunting, not the males that do the hunting normally, they have canine teeth. However the males have got bigger canine teeth and certainly in most mammals er for instance horses, males have big bigger canine teeth most primates. Chimpanzees for instance have enormous canine teeth, but the males have them and not the females, so the idea here is that normally a big canine tooth, a sexually dimorphic canine tooth is probably related to inter-male conflict, rather than to killing and, and whether, how that affects your er what you say about the spacing I'm not sure, but certainly it would be a safe erm generalization to say normally big canines are an aspect of sexual dimorphism and in mammals are very common. So what was I saying? Oh yes, erm perhaps beards are more to do wi with, with inter-male conflict than anything er and most of the other characteristics are. Erm the one element in human sexual dimorphism if you can call it that, strictly speaking it isn't, its primary sex difference is the size of the human penis. Nobody knows why it's er it's as big as it is, female choice is a possibility, only a possibility, but er it's hard to know otherwise why, why it is that way. Erm now it, it's interesting to point out that female choice and of course one of the best examples of that is birds where the female chooses not, you saw it on the film, but this is just a reminder. Where the female chooses not so much the male as what the male's got is erm female choice as I said when Darwin suggested was widely ridiculed, partly because i it, it contradicted Victorian prejudices. People said things like for instance well females aren't intelligent enough to make choices and er which is, which is clearly pretty silly, and er there was also I think and the uncomfortable erm prospect that females could in some way or another control the evolution in males which I don't think it appealed to the Victorians either and in fact many social Darwinists like Edward Westermark for example rejected the whole concept of sexual selection as Darwin called it the female choice, because it didn't promote survival of the fittest. Erm peacocks' tails may make them beautiful and more reproductively successful with peahens, but they don't make them fitter in terms of erm life expectancy. On the contrary peacocks don't live long in the wild because of those enormous tails make them easy to catch for predators. So if peacocks' er fitness as understood by social Darwinists is, is, is, is, is reduced, but erm and this was one of the reasons why they, why they liked the idea of erm female choice and er the call, so called sexual selection. The the consequence of course you want to say something? No they don't erect them when a, when a predator comes along, they just run or fly if they can. Sometimes there are displays that are erm,b but like erm the lizards that have frills, but I think you find them in both sexes because you see if it's to scare off a predator, why doesn't the female have them? And my guess is the peahen normally would. I don't know about the frilled lizard. Er Oh yes, you get that, you get that kind of mimicry, but again you'd expect it in, in, in both sexes I should think, unless it just happens that males for example normally are bigger and then it's taken on a, a secondary characteristic which is a possibility. I honestly don't know the answer to that. Okay, erm so the consequence of this and as I said this is not fashionable feminism this is, this is, this is real science. That the consequence of this is that we can no longer take the view of females as being passive victims of male advances. Often it looks as if they are, erm but they don't need to be. Here's a here's an example of this in book. This is a stag. Now you might think well stags have harem groups and they've got these enormous antlers and they could bully and er I mean a harem group looks kind of fascist kind of social structure you know when a male dominates female, but in fact field observations of how stags actually deal with their females show that they're very tender erm towards them and they have to have the cooperation of the female in order to mount. In fact if you think about it, erm any quadruped or mammal can easily stop a male mounting. You don't often see photos of this I've only ever found one, here's one, or I did find one. This is un the top, the top one, well and the bottom one, unsuccessful mounting attempts by male jackals, sorry hyenas, male hyenas on, on a female. The female erm just doesn't want to know. In fact this is more interesting than you may think because female hyenas have a pseudo-penis, they have, they have a pseudo-scrotum and a pseudo-penis, reasons which aren't fully understood and in order to mate, the male has to insert his real penis into the female pseudo-penis in order to reach her her genital and it's a bit complicated. So if the female doesn't want it and this one clearly doesn't, she just sits down and if she sits on her pseudo-penis, there's no way the male is ever gonna get into her, but in fact this is true er in, in general terms of er if you think about it a, a female quadrupedal mammal I mean it looks like male domination, the male mounts and it looks as if she has to submit but she doesn't. All she has to do is to walk away, he can't walk cos his fore legs are on her back back legs are on the ground. If she moves forward, there's no way that he's gonna get anywhere with her. I remember making this point a couple of years ago, yeah I made this point last year and I showed these pictures, I spent about twenty minutes on it, the following week I was, I was libelously accused and it was a libel, it was a serious libel erm er that I, that I said that females always had to submit erm I was very angry about that. Pity it wasn't in the national newspapers because my lawyer said I could have retired on the proceeds. laugh, unfortunately you can't erm can't erm when I was giving this similar lecture two or three years ago, erm there was er a student in the class she put up her hand she said yes, she said that's absolutely right she said, what you're saying about the female doesn't have to submit she said I used to work as a, as a stable maid at Newmarket at a stud farm and she said er you've gotta have five people for er er to cover a mare. You have one on each leg erm and one erm on the bridle and apparently they use special tools that er hobble the mare and stop her moving, so she hasn't got any choice and when they lead the stallion in, they got these five guys there erm with these various tools and they make, hold the mare still to make sure the stallion can mount, because apparently very often the mares won't have it and th they kick or they walk away. Yeah, yeah, but remember that these, these are expensive race horses you see, this is er Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you see the point I'm making that, that in mammals it's easy to get the impression that, that you know er particularly in, in, in, in er harem-type mammals like, like, like erm stags, that the males mount and females submit, they don't. Not only of course u u unfortunately of course and Sue, Sue mentions there are tragic exceptions to this and one tragic exception i is human beings because unfortunately it is possible for a male human being to force er a female at intercourse because we tend to do it lying down and males are bigger and stronger. And hands er I don't think rape could happen if we were quadrupedal, much more difficult. Erm so quite apart from fro from that, this approach to the whole question concentrating on parental investment and female choice would not only make us sensitive to to female choice in the sense of either submitting to a male or not but secondly it would make us er wonder what happened even after a female had mated and we could predict couldn't we that females ought to be discriminating abou about the subsequent fate of any fertilized erm zygote and indeed there's plenty of evidence to show that human females highly discriminated and far from passive even after they've been fertilized. For example, in er twenty five erm percent of cases er of infertility in women as reported by infertility clinics there's an antibody reaction to sperm. In other words a woman's immune system is er able to deploy erm er antibodies against a, a, a, against sperm. In ten to fifteen percent of fertilized zygotes there will be no implantation and er forty two percent that do implant will fail to cycle and will be re-absorbed again. So it's a very high proportion we're talking about. er in other words what I'm saying is that erm a woman doesn't have to accept a fertilized er egg once it's been fertilized. Er twenty eight percent for instance of all embryos er will be spontaneously aborted and in England and Wales mothers of large families, which I think was defined as more than six children, er had more spontaneous abortions than others. In sixty percent of spontaneous abortions the foetuses are normal and thirty percent in the first trimester show gross chromosomal abnormalities. In other words, it looks as if mothers erm actively discriminate against er embryos which are not normal and are not gonna develop into into in in into er offspring who will survive. Yeah, oh yes, yes, but the point is that the mother knows it's she's not her reproductive system is not a passive erm I mean you see how it looks in Yes, exactly, look exactly. I in a mammal it looks as if that the mother's body i is, is an oven, and once you've put the bun in, it's gonna rise it's not like that. The point I'm making is that in fact erm a woman's reproductive system discriminates actively. One of the most astonishing pieces of evidence for this comes from a study of two hundred and sixty eight female prisoners in the U S these are all convicted criminals. They had three hundred and seventy three live children between them and on average they should of had twenty seven children with birth defects if they'd been the same as the rest of the population, the non-criminal, non-prison erm erm erm non-prison population. In fact they had none at all. However their entire spontaneous miscarriage. So the implication of that study and it's a rather astonishing one, although it fits exactly with, with the argument we're developing is that because these, these women were living in very difficult circumstances, in prison, they were even more discriminating about the offspring they were actually and they didn't carry a single one to term that had a birth defect. So the idea is that the more difficult the the situation the mother finds herself is in the more likely she is to spontaneously abort and the more likely any retained er foetus is to be normal an and, and to, and not to have any defects. Another example of that for instance, and this is something we'll, we'll have to wait a full explanation of this we'll have to wait a little bit later itself. At least seventy three percent of all foetuses aborted in the first trimester are male. This suggests that er mothers discriminate against male offspring Seventy three percent. Seventy three percent in the first trimester, in other words the first three months are male. Now er let's just accept that as a fact as we go by erm it looks as if mothers not only discriminate against un un unfit offspring, but also against males. Why they discriminate against males must wait. where do you get the No, no oh in the general population. In the general This is the general population and as you will see this, this er patches on the whole issue of sex ratios and what is known as the Trivers Woolard effect and I'll explain that later cos it's so important. We have a separate thing on sex ratios and I'll explain why males are discriminated against in this, in this respect cos as we'll see there's a profound er reason why er this should happen. Finally, and this is a suggestion on my own, although actually I discovered afterwards it was also made by somebody else, erm but it does seem in many ways er erm an obvious interpretation, is this could be the background also to post-natal depression. Post-natal depression is a distressing phenomenon where women who have just given birth feel fed up, weepy, don't like the baby, don't want to be mothers, can't really take an interest in it. It's a very distressing erm syndrome for many women and er there's quite a lot of evidence that it's hormonally linked and most women suffer from it in one way or another. Some admittedly have it much worse than others, but nearly all women er seem to, seem to have it erm to some extent and one wonders why. Well, the Mexico City earthquake if you will recall some years ago, buried a maternity hospital on the day of the quake. All the mothers died at once. However fourteen days later they were still pulling out er live babies and they'd been in there in the rubble for fourteen days. They had nothing to drink, nothing to eat, they kind of hibernated and apparently they lapsed into a state of, of a kind of hibernation and inactivity, but they were still alive and they were alive when they, when they were pulled out fourteen days later. The reason probably is that human neonates, the newborn human beings have much more subcutaneous fat than any other primate. If you look at a new-born gorilla or chimpanzee they seem skinny little things compared with human babies. Human babies are usually fairly plump when they're born, they've got considerable subcutaneous fat. My suggestion is that the evolution of subcutaneous fat in neonates and post-natal depression is an example of co-evolution and what has happened is mothers are programmed to be depressed for the first few days after birth because in primal conditions when remember this is where evolution set the parameters of human behaviour, in primal conditions it would probably pay a mother to test her new-born offspring to see if it could survive, because if it was defective or if it was sickly, or if there was some reason why that baby couldn't make it to adulthood and its own reproductive life, that mother should not invest in it, because that's her reproductive success. So it might pay a mother to wait for a few days and see what happened to the baby. A healthy baby might survive, and unhealthy one might not. Sue you're sceptical. I'm a bit worried about that ninety percent I see Yes. Yes, I heard that, I've heard that theory. My But it does happen in that way. Yeah it does happen in that way m my,m my explanation of that though is that it's true,i it could just be a hormonal side effect. It could just be that and of course it would be very naive to assume that evolution had adapted us always to be happy with everything. In fact if you think about it evolution might promote your reproductive success by making you vaguely unhappy most of the time, cos that might make you strive for more success. So it would certainly be naive to think that whenever people felt unhappy erm it was er was some kind of pathology and that, that evolution couldn't explain it, and it may just be that the women feel a bit fed up because of hormonal changes and it doesn't awfully much, it's just one of things you pay for being a mother. . Well not immediately no. and it's and it's certainly hormonally linked and at first of course a woman doesn't have milk, she has colostrum. Yes, not very much But you see my explanation may be that because of that erm the, the onset of post-natal depression is slightly postponed because erm the mother needs a signal from the baby or in her breasts signal that will then start changes in her breast tissue which will produce milk when the time comes. So she needs the baby to do that and at that point once her milk production schedule is under way as it were, at that point when, just before she's about to start giving them, then she should test the baby because that's the big energetic cost to her. The energetic cost is providing milk. She can have the colostrum anyway. Yeah, oh yes. Sure, oh I can imagine. Well it's just an idea yeah it's just an idea,i it may not be right nobody's I, I mean it may not be right, but it, I mean as I think you can see it has a kind of logic about it, erm and, and i it may be that it, it's not the right explanation, but the very fact that erm we're suggesting it, I think shows that erm again it's naive to think that motherhood is a kind of er is a one-sided affair where you know mothers sacrifice themselves er for their offspring, because nature demands it. At the very least this theory about post-natal depressions shows it's not that simple, the mother has a self-interest as well as the offspring and our modern insight into parental investment theory shows us that we have to take every individual's self-interest seriously we're not committing th the, the crude errors of group selectionism and saying you know mothers exist for the benefit of society to have children, they should put up with it. I mean the trouble with group selectionistic thinking is you, you completely discount the costs that some people pay for the benefits of others and so oh well, you know everybody benefits from mothers erm having children and sacrificing themselves to their offspring. Our modern parental investment individualistic view wouldn't allow you to make that error, instead you'd say you know you've gotta look at the costs and benefits of the mother too and perhaps there are benefits to mothers in actively testing as it were their offspring, erm rather than just passively er accepting that they're gonna have to be mothers and gonna have to get on with it and again you see, er I would er and this may have been the big mistake I made last year, er but again I stand by my er view on this and it's a perfectly defensible one, erm again I think those who say that abortion is unnatural and kind of erm offends against er you know nature, are wrong. I mean that the data on spontaneous abortion is so unmistakable that it seems to me that artificially induced abortions are just a continuation with modern technology of something women have always done anyway discriminate against their ab about their offspring, sometimes discriminating against them. So those who say arti artificial abortion is unnatural, are I think er on a, on, on, skating on very thin ice, because you could equally well argue that it was just a continuation of a natural trend. If this doesn't happen it's almost like it's never happened any other way Yeah that's right yeah Yes. Yes, but you see the, the, yes an and that of course is a is i is a good one. As I said at the beginning I think one should be wary about using the word natural, because sometimes people use it you know to promote something you know like on advertising you know it's natural, must be good for you, but at the same time there are certain things that are natural that are very bad for you like death and if I were to say you know death is natural, nobody would think I was advocating suicide of course not. Well sorry, I, I just mentioned that in passing but Yeah Well er in general I would say that erm and this goes back to my earlier discussion o of, of the pleasure principle. It would seem that erm i it wasn't in the interests of one's ultimate reproductive success to be too easily satisfied too much of the time because remember, it's a question of relative reproductive success an and the individual that gets that little extra is is effectively gonna be, gonna be the one selected, so yes I would think that erm it's probably naive to think that natural selection would, would make you feel er satisfied and content all the time it would probably induce erm a state of mild chronic discontent which is I think what most people actually experience in life Yes then you're less likely Right. Well possibly and less likely to enjoy it, I mean I've made a complete failure of my life, so I'm, I'm not and I never really enjoyed from the beginning I must say Well, well if I'd been given the choice, erm you know if they'd said you know okay you're next, you going I'd have said no thanks, send somebody else, but er Well well perhaps not, erm no my life was all a terrible mistake erm i i i it was because of the doctor was too stupid to diagnose breast cancer when he saw it, urged my mother to have another baby told her it was a mastectomy erm er sorry erm sorry mastitis er and it would help if she had another baby and it was of course was actually cancer, it was a disaster. But there we are thus on such er tiny threads do entire lives hang. Where did we get to before we got into this? Er oh yes abortion yes now coming back to the point about abortion. One of the, and this we'll get on to later when we talk about culture, the culture problem. It seems to me you see that it's, it's naive to think that there's a complete divorce between culture and technology like for instance abortion technology or birth control technology and nature. It seems to me what actually happens if you think about it is that, is that technology and culture builds on trends that already have a natural foundation. For example birth control, you see you could use the same argument, you could say oh the Catholics say birth control is unnatural and we know they have a whole position on that and yet the data on infertility shows that in fact most women generate antibodies to some sperm, so the, those datas suggest that actively discriminating against sperm on the part of the women is actually natural and all that is happening in modern birth control technology is that women are developing or building on a natural er foundation that is already there namely to be choosy about when they become pregnant and by whom. So and I would extend the same argument to abortion and I would say erm wh what happens in abortion admittedly erm an artificial abortion mean means that presumably a spontaneous abortion has hasn't happened, but a modern woman is using extra means that she has er at her disposal, probably to deal with extra problems which evolution originally could not foresee and ultimately her self-interest might be just as well served by having er induced the abortion ultimately as it would by erm by not having but I mean this is just my personal view, and I don't Well yes, I think, I think their view is dominated by the old group selectionist or point that women are there to do their duty Yeah, that females are there to do their deed for the species or the race or whatever an and er and indeed I mean not so long ago you know in our own country I mean I think it's a moral issue Yeah, oh it is a moral issue yeah. But the, the link between sex and reproduction is always likely to be more critical to a woman So, so, so you see th th the point I'm making is these insights seem to me to be to have a kind of relevance to er women's experience of sex that is some ways greater than it is to male males can you know once they've done their fertilizing work, they're, they're really through as far as erm as far as biology is concerned, not perhaps as far as social . Were you gonna say something Sue? Oh I think so, I mean I, again I hope there aren't any Catholics in the audience who are offended by my remarks, but it's just my personal opinion, that yeah,th th you know,th th that is the case and at the least I mean whatever judgment one makes about this thing, I, I repeat what I said earlier about you gotta be terribly careful when using the word natural. I think it's unscientific, prejudicial and subjective to use it in a term that carries any kind of recommendation or erm disapprobation and er I think, I think one has to exercise caution in erm in the way you use tha tha that, that term, perhaps it's better not to, not to use it at all. Well that makes a kind of convenient break actually, because what I wanted to start on er then was things which really perhaps ought to be postponed till, till next. What I wanna talk about next week is some er peculiarities of human female erm adaptations such as concealed oestrus and menstrual synchronization. Just before we leave it, er to come back to the nature it's quite interesting, what these people found was they studied adders in I think Denmark and what they found was adders adders copulate, but females can store semen for months. They counted the number of the copulations and they found the females were copulating much more than they needed in order to have, have offspring, so the big problem is why do female adders go to all the trouble of extra copulations with extra males when they could easily just make do with one or two and store the semen, and er the consequence as you could have predicted I think having attended my lectures, is that there does seem to be selection for erm sperm competition in male adders and the, the supposition seems to be that females are openly inciting male sperm competition, because they're mating with many more males than they need to and there doesn't seem to be another gain, they don't get provisioning from a male, they, all they get is sperm. The question is why they enjoy sex Sorry what makes what more likely? Sex. The female Yes. She's more likely to indulge Yes. some behaviour like that. Yes it might, but the authors don't mention it actually as a possibility. Perhaps you ought to write in to Nature. why females have orgasms. Mm. I mean if males have orgasms why shouldn't Well that's next week's Yeah, I agree with that, I, I agree with that. That's the Alexander Noonan theory we'll be talking about that. Yes, as you'll see I mean basically I think the erm the reason is they just need to hang on until the male's finished, but we'll we'll come to that next week. Tonight live, the happiness pill, the terrorist godfathers and circuses. Are they right to use domestic cats? Roll up, roll up, it's Central Weekend. Good evening, welcome to Central Weekend and to our audience, they come from Ludlow. welcome. We start tonight with a big row that's brewing over this little pill. It's new and it's given to people who feel depressed. Your doctor prescribes it as Prozac but it's already earned the nickname the happiness pill, but is it safe? Oliver what's so wonderful about Prozac as an antidepressant? Well it doesn't actually make less people depressed that its predecessors, the great thing about it is is that it only only one quarter of the people who take it get side effects. So the old tricyclic antidepressants make you know most people get a lot of side effects. The second this about it, it's certainly not addictive in any way, it's not like the barbiturates Valium and so on. It's er you know it's completely okay to take and stop taking it, and you won't want to have to go on. And the third thing is that about twenty to thirty per cent of people who take it undergo a dramatic transformation in their personality, it seems, so it's claimed in America and there's a lot of evidence that might be true, erm and that is you know a huge difference from er just an ordinary antidepressant. So who's it really for, who's gonna m get the most benefit out of it? Well it's it works best with people who =r mildly depressed in fact,l less so with very severely depressed people, but that is the great majority of people, one in three women with children under the age of five are depressed, for example, so it's a huge advantage for them to be able to take it and not have side effects. Dr Vernon , is this the way to make depressed people happy? Have the drug companies at last come up with something approaching a m little miracle? It's a load o crap. The I feel as if I'm in a time war, I really do. Twenty years ago I was on programmes li , was Central Weekend on twenty years ago, I don't , twenty years ago Feels like it I was on, sorry? feels like it Well twenty years ago I was on programmes like this, saying that doctors who said that Valium and the other tranquillizers were perfectly safe were talking rubbish and that there was every possibility that there would be problems found in the future, if we kept prescribing these drugs for vast numbers of people. And now here we are again with yet another wonder miracle drug, which they say has got no side effects and which is wonderful and is gonna make all these people really happy No we said a quarter of people who take it get side effects. Let me tell y er have you seen What's it got to do with Valium. What's it got to do with Valium at all? It's got a lot to things like hormone replacement therapy or even primrose oil or whatever the hell and they're sitting there at an age when they are fairly loaded up with experience and maturity and all the rest of it and they don't know what they are doing . All the wisdom of er in, in writing and doctors and everything else says oh it all varies you know some do this and some do that some go straight through in a regal dignified way and they just carry on into relatively old age, you know, smooth as relaxed, nothing to worry about, away. Mm, mm And tt Jan was er was er wondering during last year and went on to hormone replacement therapy because she was and the doctor was a bit concerned about possible osteoporosis which is erm brittle bone Yeah i it's, it's obviously a thing which, if one can possibly avoid it's a good idea to and erm I must say it helped but it you don't know what is helping because you know we don't know what her symptoms are going to be . Maybe H R T was helping what her symptoms would have been if she hadn't taken them, maybe they were worse because she was, maybe they were the same in spite of it, but I dunno. Er anyhow th th the, the eventual thing was maybe her blood pressure was going up higher than it should and maybe whether the cumulative stress of having a husband off in my state, maybe Yeah what her, you know maybe all sorts of things Yeah well this is,th this is it I mean th th there are often a lot of things happening at the same time er er some of which as you just sort of hinted at are sort of er erm of a psychological er er have a psychological factor in them which all add to it don't they? Well my feeling is that you know if yo if you're car doesn't run tinker with the carburettor and if it still isn't running right, tinker with something else, if you like, the fatal thing is to tinker with both because then you just don't know what you've got, and erm she's been on, on this hormone replacement which is er er no big deal but, you know, hormones are Well th big things. I, I, I've met ladies who have, have really benefited Oh yeah from it. oh yeah. Yeah. Erm her blood pressure was being, being depressed er by some other, you know, blood pressure regulator and erm one of the side effects of hormone replacement may be, yeah,that people's susceptibility to migraine is heightened. So y y y you, you, you, you've got at least three things which are all sort of brewing up there and you think good grief what a, what a, what a state to be in because the poor doctor doesn't know what on earth to do, poor Jan doesn't know, well it's worse for Jan cos she's sitting there thinking I'm going potty or, you know, can't stand properly or you know is leaning over or, or numb down one side of her face or, or or whatever it was, it was i i it was the, the dizziness I think actually which which was most alarming. And so erm get flu on top of it all erm Quite. It really is a very difficult, difficult erm Yeah there's quite a bit of flu about at the moment isn't there? Yeah. Well what I know the answer is is to say don't worry be concerned but don't worry because worrying doesn't do you no good, it doesn't do the condition no good and it doesn't do everybody else any good either because they just say oh she's you know what she is, depressed by whatever it is and that's, as it were, objectively logical but wh wh what seems to me to be the absolutely overwhelming is to say he's not worried, he's desperately concerned, he's more concerned than humans can possibly be but if god isn't worried, what on earth are we burning up our resources worrying about because if he's not worried concerned yes, but he's not worried. Who are you talking about now? God. Oh god, yeah. Yeah. I mean he is desperately concerned, I mean he, he loves us all with a concern which just er er er er i is greater than anything we can understand, so concern at the at the slightest er doubt about, I can't understand how concerned he is but er I totally relax Yeah but if the god of heaven is concerned that's fine, he's not worrying because he created the whole thing, therefore it seemed to me pretty good reason to be concerned Concerned but not worried. but not worried, and I'm certainly not Yeah I, well I'm with you mm you know, lying awake at nights you know cos er th three and four in the morning everything's quiet, you know, Mm. the heating's off Yeah. I think people who are liable to worry about their condition have a very very difficult time at three and four in the morning and er old ladies are particularly vulnerable I think. Well I, I had a period of waking up at four Isn't it and not going off again. Isn't it Mind you demoralising? Yeah but I'd far sooner do that than not get off to sleep at night. Yeah I think that's that's right, you know. That's where everyone's different of course but erm I, I think it is, it is it is a factor that erm one can watch television or can listen to the radio or one can go for a walk or do all sorts of things as it were before noon and midnight but three or four in the morning, you know, when everything is Mm at a very low level I think it's a very potentially demoralising thing Mm al although Yeah although it didn't, it didn't I w I wasn't too concerned about it, I thought well you know I'm resting er and er I'm the sort of person who only needs about six hours, if I get six hours I'm okay erm, you know, on a regular basis I'm talking about. So er I mean it didn't really affect me too much. But it's a low time isn't it? And it can be Mm. Well er well er here again I think er it's the old old story of erm it affects different people different ways. Where some people are better a at night I'm erm I'm now talking about before going to bed Mm. th than first thing in the morning erm whereas I, I think probably I am probably better as soon as I get up than last thing at night. Yes er I, I, I, I think one's either an owl or a some other bird which,wh wh which doesn't at night but does by, by, by day you know. Yeah I, I, I think that er the, the, the M S Society have er er say that we've got eighty thousand members in the United Kingdom, Great Britain, Northern Ireland only problem is they appear to have eighty thousand different conditions Yeah yeah That's absolutely right. Every doctor will say you know Yeah yeah. people do differ Yeah. and some of them differ so much from others who you put in the same box and you Mm. think well maybe we've got the box wrong. Mm. I think, I think that's it and er tt You mentioned Christopher , what er the last time it's, I'm going back a little while, the last time I was talking with Janet he, she was a bit unhappy, I think he was in er a teaching practice at the time and she was wondering how he was going to go on. That must be the best part of the year ago I should think though now. Yeah. Well the, the, the, the, the sort of, the sort of background as I have seen it he never struck me as being particularly clever or bright it's just that he always seemed to be very well taught and academically successful and exams never seemed an undue problem, and so he went off to Wolverhampton Poly which he selected for, you know, all the usual reasons, reasonable place, reasonable course, a reasonable this a reasonable that,tt erm to do computer science which of course all the kids want to do now erm twentieth centu no it isn't it's a sort of nineteen eighties version of wanting to be an engine driver isn't it? They all want to be so he went off to be a computer scientist and either he was too interested in er what he describes as cult television which you think but it's not television,i i it's, it's Doctor Who and, and Prisoner and, you know er very interesting and very easy for enthusiasts to direct a lot of their time and energy to maybe I don't maybe there was a increased pressure to work and study which was erm self motivated rather than being externally imposed, maybe he maybe there was a fundamental lack of enthusiasm in him for what is described as the hardware of computing, the, the, the, the, the instruments, the machines maybe there was a less than comprehensive understanding of what is known as the firmware, that's to say I mean operating systems that are built into the thing to make it work, you've got to understand the firmware because otherwise you don't understand what the machine will think you mean and what that will do and I would have thought that whereas superficially you can ignore the firmware, it's all in there, it understands as you, I would have thought, grew into a er a graduate computer scientist you've got to have some idea about that. Er maybe he was, I think, a little superficial in his enthusiasm for what is referred to as the software, that's to say that's the computer programs that you Yeah. write, you write and er feed into the thing which it operates along the rules defined by its firmware which someone else has put into it. Anyhow, whatever it was, maybe a little, as Jan says, he also had a f a bad flu bug at a bad time anyhow he crashed out of the computer science course and he announced that he was only regarding the computer science course as being a stepping stone to being a teacher so the sensible thing to do would be to go on to the teacher training course at Lancashire, an education course, cos that's what he wanted to do. So that cost an awful lot of money because he was on a grant of course and he, he spent er about a year as a trainee teacher and we thought that was great because he was, he was dealing with, with er Wasn't he i in juniors yeah yeah Well I can't remember what the terms are, infants er There's infants and juniors isn't there? Yeah it,i it's the very young ones Ah infants. it was the very young ones and er the vast majority of infant teachers are girls Yeah. and so he had a a degree of uniqueness and er in the area that he was vast numbers of ethnic minorities so he was er he was a white male vegetarian and I would have thought it was absolutely great, you know,he really, I would have though had a stimulating, challenging lovely environment to, to, to be in, I, I, I, I, I hoped that if he was going , I thought he was going to go on, it was just going to be very expensive tt paying his fees, his this I was therefore a little surprised and very disappointed when he failed his teaching practice. Erm I was, I was a bit erm about that, you know, I just though what on earth now? He is unemployed and receiving state benefit as employed which isn't very much Is he at home or is he down there? He wants, wants to stay with us forever Yeah quite. Quite. I erm am obviously feeling guilty cos I'm not feeling guilty but it makes me cough a bit to go to the post office every week and get vastly more disabl disability er invalidity benefit than he gets, vastly more. And each month Boots Pensions Limited pay me a very reasonable pension. Mm. large, not generous but I think good grief poor Christopher's sitting there . I agree the state is picking up his, his rent which is er er quite a lot er but even so, you know,he hasn't got very much money and cannot have a very enthusiastic view of what the future holds Yeah, yeah. It's a very bad time. It is bad Yeah. So he's, he's now doing er A level psychology and G S C E sociology at night school whilst he is keeping his days free to try and get a job which is not easy anywhere Right. it is no easier in greater Wolverhampton, and if you have eczema and a congenitally weak back you aren't actually falling over yourself in prospects for the best chances. So erm we're both very concerned, not worried, very concerned about what on earth he is doing and what he is going to do. Yeah quite. You know he's twenty two, twenty three years old, you know, you know whatever he's doing he's liable to be with him for a few years yet and what can one see Yeah. You know? Yeah. There just doesn't seem to be anything on the, on the horizon. So after he's, he's sat these two exams erm Is he doing them this year? Yeah, Mm. he may be eligible to be on a training course, for what we don't know, but er after you've been unemployed six months you are either required to or you have the opportunity to, or you can go on a state training course but what they train you for or to do we, we haven't actually got defined yet. And possibly either after that or simultaneously with that or to transfer there, he might go up to live in his father's house up in Yorkshire, Mytholmroyd er er I dunno but it seems to me that if there is a worse place to be unemployed than Wolverhampton, West Riding has gotta be erm a competitor Yeah, yeah and Hebden Bridge and Sowerby Bridge seem to be, you know, on each side of M Mytholmroyd, you know, on a railway line from Halifax which goes through to and Todmorden and places. Beautiful part of the world, you know, maybe that's exactly what you wanna do, you wanna kick out Wolverhampton and go for Mytholmroyd particularly if you've got a house or if your father's got a house there which is there maybe a lot, a lot , a lot going for it but you're looking for this long term prospects Yeah quite er it doesn't sound too good. So er I I thought to myself well I dunno, I dunno all these Newton girls have been off to Sri Lanka or or, or Zaire or wherever and you'd you know, isn't that great? Don't really want to he's not very keen on the prospect of going V S O or whatever. And then I say to myself oh come on, oh don't say when I was your age I wanted did nearly or whatever. Say But then they have to er raise money to go. Right. I mean it I think it's only, I don't think he, he's there's any cheap answers No. and I know la well some time when retirement was looking on the on the horizon I was saying to him you're not alone but, you know, you've gotta be looking towards being on your own because of course mother and I hope father and I will be around to want to pick up what we can to help you've gotta start thinking about standing on your own feet, you know, because admittedly I er I, I, I could turn out to be not as bad a financial state as I anticipated but I never was stinking rich and I'm certainly not stinking rich now, so erm I mean No but quite apart from that, er th there's anybody er needs to aim to be self sufficient don't they? Well I, I, I, I think that you've got to move in that direction rather than maintaining the status quo. So erm if, if it was er if it was a matter of oh bankrolling him out to wherever it was or supplementing his own resources okay, but the, the experience and I mean the personal experience as well as the er the skills experience Mm. that Yeah but he's got to want to do it. Quite. Er erm that's the, that's the crucial bit. Absolutely. There is no possible way of shipping an unwilling young person out. No that's right. Because even I don't think there ever was. e e even those that er you know are definitely wanting to go and keen can get homesick fairly soon. Oh yeah. But you know erm if, if, if you look back to the days of the Raj erm it was a even within my living memory, erm people were joining the armed services or the overseas er er corp and the civil service overseas I suppose, yeah, er at a, at a fairly humble level and would either work their way up or they drink themselves stupid or they get mixed up with someone or they, you know but it was a, a, a recognized way of, of, of going, you know, either join the services or the Mm. or the church of course was another one, erm but none of these traditional erm avenues exist now No. and more and more and more people are looking for experience, they're looking for vocations, they're looking for er the sort of attributes which, you know, aren't actually overflowing when you're unemployed in Wolverhampton That's right. having failed out on two poly courses. So erm we as, we as I say are very concerned about er that can't have done Jan any good, that's No no, that's right. She really has this er attitude which I cannot understand because erm a a as I think it was Al Reeve said, you know, erm some people can't bear children, we can't, but we like them but if you have actually borne children, you are in other words a mother, you've gotta have a attitude, not only to children in general but to your children in particular, which is very very difficult for er a male to understand and a non-father, it's gonna be very very difficult cos I personally don't have any children at all and therefore it is very very difficult for me to even comprehend but given that I can erm I can sympathize with something I do not comprehend it must be monumentally difficult for her Yeah. it really must . Yes, oh yes,th th that's right, there's no doubt about it. And erm poor Jan is saying what have I done, should I have done, could I have done Yeah. and, you know, once you start into, into that er scenario yo yo yo you, you, you can't very very little erm opportunity for anything because all you can do is, is to say what do we do now, never mind what we could, should or might have done then, what do we do now because the future is that way and the past is Yeah. We can be influenced by history, we can, we learn from history, we can do all sorts of things about history but what er er as far as er Christopher's concerned, what do we do now because that I just don't know! I just No. don't know! No that's right. And erm the really distressing thing is I think Christopher is saying what to do now I think he is saying oh you know Yeah. I, I've been Yeah depending on, sponging off er whatever for however long and now he is going, is, is retiring on health grounds, you know, he really isn't going to be er able to bankroll me You mean he, he's now talking about you? Yeah, yeah. Well I mean, yeah, he Er thinking, yeah. he's not, he's not, he's not a, he's not stupid, Christopher, he, he's certainly not stupid, and er he must have seen, I mean I assume he keeps his bank statements, I mean I'm afraid we have one or two bank statements which show thousands of pounds that he's received from us over the last year erm and, you know, he can't blind because they've all gone through his bank account, you know, he must Yeah, quite be thinking good grief, you know, I haven't had a a, a, a successful, happy year or so No. and it has, it has represented volumes of money which the state can't or won't or doesn't carry on with. So I think he's sitting there in Wolverhampton about this time wondering what on earth he is I'm sure he must be looking forward to and that is a very very painful situation to be in isn't it? Mm. I, I just don't know what he's, he's, he's, he's, he's seeing his future as being and erm maybe cos we haven't got , maybe erm it's because of the generation gap, maybe it's because of communication problems either between me and him or the young and old or whatever but, you know, he just doesn't seem to have anything to volunteer er other than ah well I'll try and get a job or ah well I'll try and get some more qualifications or whatever. So, yeah, that's sort of Yeah, yeah anoth another bit in the Yeah. Where, whereabouts is Lyndsey in her training now? Oh she's erm tt she is the brighter spark on the horizon I suppose, you know? It makes me cough a bit because when I came on the scene he was the one academically everything and she was the one who was academically rather disadvantaged but she, she was, you know,no not having the greatest of, of, of success but erm it was said that she wouldn't be able to be a student nurse because she wasn't bright enough but you know she clocked up the O levels and A levels like guide badges and she went off on this pre-nursing course in South Notts you know and she was in and out of the Queens on a course and people and, you know,and she said I don't know all the answers but I've a rough idea about some of the questions, I want to be a nurse and off she went to, to, to Walsall and I'm not saying she's a brilliant student nurse but erm absolutely clear that she's better than some of the others. And er, you know, that's negative if you will but it's fact Yeah. and she's still enjoying it which is great Yeah, so, so what year is she, er third year? Yeah. Mm. Takes her finals this, this summer. And erm not only er do I think that er she'll probably be reasonably good with, with finals I'm absolutely sure that her course reports from, you know, all the places where she's been will be better than most of the other candidates, you know, because she brings home these,the these reports, you know, and she says it looks alright, you know,beginning of the course Nurse is lacking in this or has not got that or is not, you know, you think mm pretty the end of the course Nurse got the hang of, is very good, has done this, has done that, has supported this and you think mm pretty, well that's lovely you know but she didn't have the experience during the whatever, she had been given the experience and the end of it brilliant Mm. A or whatever it is, you know? Mm. And er I, I would therefore think that i it's, it's unlikely that she'll crash out on her exams. But if she did I think she will pass out on her record because perhaps, even more delightful than someone who, you know, sitting down to an exam and, and doing reasonably well on it. So I, I, I think that er one of the, the comforting things which er I c I can see is that she has grown in self confidence, not cockiness, self confidence. She has learnt, she has absorbed inwardly digested a quantity, a consid considerable quantity of it, I think that she will be a reasonably useful nurse to have around. Mm. That's lovely Yeah, yeah You know, they, they, they can be a bit hard, they can be a bit bitter, they can drink a bit too much, they can be a bit promiscuous, they can be all sorts of rather iffy things but I don't think Lyndsey will. I, I, I, I've got, I think all the evidence is building towards her being Mm. a good little nurse. Yeah. What on earth she does then I dunno. Erm mm I can't remember, Alan and Josie's daughter down the road, erm she passed out as a nurse from Queens a while ago and you know what students are in general, nurses in particular , there was, you would expect, one hell of a party when the exam results were public what came out of the the party was when she got a job as a nurse. And that is absolutely mind blowing to me Yeah. because I can remember, and it's not that long ago for goodness sake, that if you qualified as a nurse, and will probably tell even the same story to an extent, there was no problem about a job, you were a certified nurse, bang. That's right. Well er I mean that's not going back too far either. Well it ain't now Mm. and er er er er the situation is that you can, in, in some of these nursing schools where they have taught you and it is their letterhead that's on your pass-out, they still aren't in a position to say oh well there's a job of course because you don't need to have passed out top, you know, to be guaranteed a job, there ain't no jobs guaranteed for no one. And er I just don't know what to do. California and Saudi Arabia are two of the, you know, destinations that come to mind but erm I don't know about that either, you know, if she doesn't What month does she take the exam? Oh I er er I think it's erm July or er June, July or August, it's, it's, it's it's Yeah. the summer. I think she maybe takes the exams in June and gets the results in July and er then we're fifty in August and then we go off to North America in September I think, you know, er I think, I, I can't quite remember the details but erm You've got a holiday booked? Yes, yes Good. well we've erm we've erm we've been rather tempted by the west coast er I personally want to see the Grand Canyon and erm I'd like to see San Francisco so the package which is being offered to the Boots Association with whom we've been away several times and we lo we like it as, as a, as a background because you've got a rough idea, you know, the people you're going with Yes. there are, there are very very few who are chasing women or men and there are very very few who are er requiring to be prised out of the bar erm at two o'clock in the morning. There are very very few who are er interested in finding a gambling haunt or a, you know, television or film theatre or whatever, you know, er er by and large there are a lot of people who chat to a waitress if they're a bloke or, or chat to the, the whatever it is if they're girls but er in, in a, in a friendly way, who will have a drink but will not be paralytically drunk, who may watch television or a, you know, film or theatre or something if it's appropriate but won't get twitched if it isn't, you know, and and by and large erm all the people we've, we've, we've, we've come across I came across before have been very very good company and it is, it is delightful to have the have you, cos have you been on a Si on a Signpost? Yes a Signpost holiday, yeah Yeah. Mm. Well er I think that getting away the oh you live in Nottingham, oh fancy that you know, you, you know where you're starting, you know, everyone either works for Boots or used to work for Boots and, you know, you've got a rough idea, you, you, you don't need to go into the oh fancy that you know, all that's arranged so erm I think i i it's,i i i it's the middle of September when we either go to Los Angeles, I think we go to Los Angeles, and fool around Hollywood and San Diego and places and down to to see a and then away off to erm Las Vegas and Flagstaff you know about this meteor crater in Flagstaff, that apparently is why you go to Flagstaff tt a meteor came, the meteor crater is there tt and then the Grand Canyon and go through national park which San Francisco and erm spend erm two or three days there and then come back again. Tt so erm we are thinking it will be, like everybody else, it's not a good idea to put too much off too far into the future Oh no no, you want to go. I, I think, well I think so. And so er friends of ours, he's got muscular dystrophy and he's sort of in the same sort of and so we we'll have a decrepit contingent,he and I will sort of and the two girls who are relatively young and healthy will go charging around and taking photographs and doing the tourist thing. Yeah. Yes. Sort of on the, on the horizon for the end of the year and er I, I er don't know how we're going to do but erm I think the answer probably is to take a chunk at a time on the basis that erm one isn't going to be able to charge around as violently, actively as some people will. Yeah, yes er erm that's oh you must because then you have the memories. Exactly. Exactly. Not only does no one want to take those away, no one can take them away That's right. that's er that's right, you know, and erm what I'm saying to myself is okay, you know, er maybe it will be tiring, I'm sure it will maybe it will be erm expensive, like take a taxi because can't walk, you know, erm erm okay that's, that's, that's the way it is and er Yeah. we'll I think, be okay and, provided we don't excessively energetic and too stupid, get too hot in the bath or that's not a very good thing to do, or crash out with er flu or something I dare say anyone can crash out, I mean you, you, you could be a president of the United States Exactly and be in, in Japan and you can crash out but er Yeah. we'll see how it er What are your,wh what are you pla er er your plans? Are you, are you going on a, a ship again or ? No I, I haven't got any plans at the moment, you know I've been sort of er I usually go around this time you know, er It it's certainly looking Yeah I've still got swollen fingers which I am er er I've needed as much physio on these as on, on the finger that was done. Why was that? They just swoll sw swelled up and erm I don't know why but I'm told it's not unusual. Mm. Because of the, the tinkering around it must do a bit of And erm but as I say I, I, I have, I still haven't got full use of those. Are they, are they coming? Yes I yes they are er but I seem to have reached a, a stage where they're not progressing as much as I would like you know? They're, they're, oh they're vastly improved to, to, I mean when I first had the er plaster off, which was for ten days it was, I could not believe it that these fingers were not going but I'm told that that's quite usual. Well i it's a very complicated bit of gear and Yeah. it's been tinkered around with I mean I don't Yes but er I think i it's a combination of things, it's the fact that you've got your erm hand in plaster so your fingers are not moving and you lose muscle tone so quickly. Mm. Particularly with something which is otherwise in Yeah. almost continuous use Ah right. perhaps not to a very violent er extent but it's, it's, it's moving. Yeah that's right, that's right. So er to get to your question erm I've sort of not been doing anything erm I was hoping that I would be sort of fully fit round about now and then if I saw something on teletext er that was good I'd just buzz off for a week or so. Cos I I got one off teletext erm er it must have been nineteen ninety now for Tenerife four star hotel, seven days, East Midlands Airport for one hundred and fifteen pounds half board er er the following day which was fantastic. I mean everything was good, the flight, the hotel, the weather. Er and, and these are erm to fill up the, the exercise, the Yes they're er er short term they're a filling up, the plane, yeah. Filling up the plane and the hotel, spaces that the, this particular company had, yeah. You don't see many like that, I'm not expecting that again. Well. Especially East Midlands Airport, it's very seldom you see an East Midlands Airport bargain. But erm no I shall er Is, is, is that national nationally advertised? Yes, yes So so most of them are London Gatwick or Manchester. Most of them er er that are advertised are from London Gatwick. So as it were you, you, you turn up holidays and you, you, you, you, you scroll through until you Yeah. Well they, they, they scroll through themselves, I mean you have no control er they are on three five two is one of the n the numbers and er there, there's probably be about four to six pages which, you know, go er er er you have to wait, I mean they just go through I don't know about twenty seconds perhaps each Oh so page there, there is time to erm Oh and you can hold i i if there's one comes up you can hold it. Oh I see yes, yes. Mm. Yeah. a a and yes that is, that is quite erm that is quite erm You'd be interested in teletext, you must have a teletext set next time you have a set. Well yeah I suspect we will but erm I, I don't mean just for holidays, I, I i i it seems that an enormous number of people who have got it erm do find it er useful. Whether it is er particularly important to an individual depends on the individual again Mm mm and er I suspect most people would be only keeping an eye on the foreign exchange page, you know, when they were thinking about buying Yeah, yeah, yeah but I mean there's the weather forecast including the local weather forecast erm that you can switch on any time and er news of course erm oh er er lots and lots. It's, it's amazing how much there is Do you get a teletext directory? You Well you know it's gonna be page three five two but how do you know it's page three five two, do you just di did, yeah, did ori ah ah yes but er do you go through, through three five one before you got there ? Yeah they, they erm when you switch the teletext on it comes on to a hundred, that's the thing, and, and, and on that a hundred they'll give you er news one O two or whatever it is, you know, and so on. But also one nine nine is the index of the whole lot. And, and you, you, you, do you select Ceefax or, or Oracle? Or Yeah, yeah you does it No er yes,wha what you do er okay one is B B C One so if you put text on that, then obviously Ceefax will come up. Yes. Now you've got to go back to T V to get Change to to three I T V and then you text for your Oracle. Oh I see. Cos it's,i i it's, it's, it's, it's, it's very very clever isn't it? It is very clever. It's, it's is it two lines the picture that have got the teletext data on them? How do you mean? Where is it? Where's the information? It must be transmitted Ah yes. and it must be transmitted on Yeah B B C One and I T V it's er on B B C One and B B C Two er The same? I think they are the same but three and four are different. Er B B C Two I think B er three and four are different. Channels Four three and four? is different to Oracle Oracle er is well is different to er er channel three. I think they're probably both Oracle. Oh so it's just Yeah but in other words what I'm saying is that there are diff It's three page hundreds Yeah that you've got to look at. Yes, yes, yes yes. Erm So your but but on, no, on your er, no, on your Oracle er channel three, one nine nine what will be shown up on your index will be channel three and channel four Aha so, and, and you will see that's, that er I don't know whether some are all the same, but erm there are different, yeah, you know, erm in other words what I'm saying is they're not on both channels. So they're, I don't know whether it's,i it's terribly reactionary to say that we really want one teletext cos your holidays, might they be coming up on Ceefax No, no,i it's pur it's all Oracle Oracle, yeah, cos it's an advertisement, I mean the people who are er er it is er being paid for by the people who advertise it. Yeah. Yeah I, I think you'll find that erm when the colour er when B B C Two came along and all the aerials went to U H F, we went from a four O five line That's right to a six two five Something. line and I think you'll find that now there are in fact six two three lines of television information, and there are two lines which are dedicated to carrying teletext data Oh and I think that's where the , there's no sound is there? No, you get the sound of the erm the programme. Oh really? Oh yes, if you, you, no you get the sound, if I erm s say I've got Oracle erm channel three on and I switch to text, I will still get the sound of the television programme Ah I see. Which will be confusing. Well you can mute it if you want you see. Yes of course, yes of course And you can mix it. You, you can have your erm if you were watching a programme and er, I've done this, erm if you're watching a programme and you want to see what the weather forecast is er you can have that superimposed on your programme. And, and the other way What in a, in a No, no over the top. Over the top? Over the top. Oh I see. And the other thing erm which er er is good, supposing you're watching er a programme and there's a football match on and you're interested in the, the football er but you don't really want to keep, you know, switching to find out what the score is, er I'm talking about teletext as opposed to a programme, you press the update and it w er and if something's happened, you know, they've changed and there's been a score, it'll come up er er while you're watching the programme, er it'll let you know that erm there's been something happening. Er it's, it's amazing. I don't know what that is. It's not you is it? It isn't, no. Is it, it's not your er central heating is it? Ah might be. It might be. Yes that, that sounds like it. Yeah, yeah. Yes the erm these things,an and can you er can you record teletext? No, I tried that the other day. No. Yo fr er you're talking about video? Yeah. Yeah. And if you're playing a tape back which was recorded off air what happens if you push the text button? Don't know. Because the data, you see, the two lines, I would have thought would have been recorded without you meaning it to be recorded Ah well I can let me er say this, er you, you know how some programmes er you can have erm oh you may not know excuse me erm there are certain programmes which you can er put in eight eight eight and you get captions Ah ye yes,i if that's available. If it's available. Yes, yes. Erm now if you record that programme and then, on video, and then play it back you can't put in eight eight eight and get it. Oh. Mm i it, I, I, I, I d I dunno as I say i i it, it, it seems to me to be an incredibly clever You would enjoy it. arrangement. Yeah, yeah, yeah But erm The television of course i is infernally clever, I mean th there's er no doubt that the microchips that erm takes away the erm the teletext information, stores it and then spits up whatever you ask for is er two or three P now I suppose and therefore the, the television manufacturer charges hundred pounds to put it in. Mm. It's er it's you're, you're, you're, you're quite erm hooked on it? Ah well yes I wouldn't like to be without it now. Definitely not. And is, is there much difference between er Ceefax and Oracle? Well They look more or less the same do they? Yeah I mean the news is very similar of course erm Presumably that's indicated or is it? Dunno because I think it isn't actually come to think of it B B C will do their own and I T V will do their own Oh yeah oh it's definitely their own, yes. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm a bit of a newshound so I look at both of course, see what's what. I'm er I'm not saying I, the headlines you see, so I will select the headline I'm interested in. And would And then it'll come up, you know, I'll put in w er one O two is the headlines for Ceefax for instance and then the stories will be from one O three to about one one five or something like that you see. And er th so er if I'm interested in er George Bush's illness, you know, and that's one O four I'll put in one O four and then that will come up on the screen. So presumably wh wh what bank are you with? What I'm with Barclays. Oh I suspect they're you bank with totally ignorable. If you're with er National Westminster erm y y y y you, you, you know about these, these, these cash tills that you put a card in and Yeah. ask it questions, it's obviously on the telephone because you can ask what the balance is and it will tell you, and it can't possibly know that and Cleethorpes, when you put the card in the Cleethorpes thing, that, you know, your bank balance at Nottingham is so it's obviously on the telephone erm and it's on the telephone to a central computer which holds quite a lot of information, it accesses Quite. it very very quickly That's right, yeah. so why shouldn't you telephone that computer? And the answer is, no reason at all. And if you're with National Westminster, you telephone a, a n a number in Manchester or Birmingham or two or three other places I guess but as far as we're concerned er the Birmingham Manchester one's the cheapest you, you ring them up and you give them A your identification number and it immediately tells you what your balance is. Immediately. What do you want to do? Well of course there's a whole range of things you can order, you know, chequebooks and bank statements, you can do all s all sorts of things Yeah, yeah, yeah. you can do with the till in the wall Yeah. but you can also say I want a transaction too and the machine then comes back to you with one of these sepulchral voices, you know, which is tone Yes generated or whatever, who do you wish to pay to, and we have four erm electricity board, the gas board, the er er er credit card and the, can't remember what the fourth one is, you simply say I wanna pay number four how much do you wish to pay to the Royal Bank of Scotland and you say how much you wish to pay in, er in pence and it immediately says you wish to pay blah blah blah it will be done. Couple of days later a little note comes in the post saying that you've just paid the National West National Bank Bank of Scotland twenty three pounds thirty and it's absolutely brilliant! Barclays haven't got one yet? Well er er I think not because I would have heard, I mean obviously they would've er Well er Nat West have been very quiet about Action Line erm because they haven't quite got the the, the, all the firmware sorted out yet but it's absolutely fantastic, you know Mm it's just, just erm but i i i er er have you got a, a tone telephone or a pulse telephone? It's probably a switch I've got several Well erm probably on the back you can select whether it er sends a number by pulse, and you can tell actually cos it's very you d you'll dial Well the old dial was pulse was The twiddle dial? Yeah. Oh yes Yeah, yeah. but some push button telephones send one as one pulse and two as two pulses Yes. whereas others send wuls er one as a beep and two as a ooh Ah in other words the pitch of the Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. I think mine are erm the pulse type, mm. Well usually erm modern telephones have got a switch on the back and you can switch them to pulse or tone Oh? I don't think mine have. One of those four switches across the top is the pulse tone. Oh yeah I can see that. Yeah. But erm you bleep with one, one of ours is, is, is erm on tones now and you can tell the diff you, you, you can tell Is that the big match then? Sunday? Mm. No we're doing erm little matches. Ah. Yes, yeah. I just wondered because er Trevor was there I just wondered if he was I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. He hasn't phoned yet has he? No I was just, I was just thinking about the same. Oh my word, Eddy right, off you go then. yeah Where are the phones? You send him off now, come on he won't, won't shout, he won't shout. Come here Hello, hello, hello. Shh! Come here. Right. She says well I am wagging my tail as well. Come here. You're not at Crufts then? Oh is it Crufts? Mm. Oh Luce! You've missed your vocation Luce, there! How are you anyway? Alright thank you how are you? Oh alright, alright, alright! I'm alright, reasonably. Oh you're alright in this part, it's this part is it, that part? Let's have a look ooh! I'm still not er my fingers are still not going Yes! down, my good ones. And it's not quite straight yet is it? Will it straighten? Oh well I I'm not expecting it to be a, a miracle. Come here Can you do that with it then ? I You've still got your mike on. I know. I'm, I'm now erm having you, having you told me this having you said that, you just look at that Erm have you been preaching? Well why do you have it on? No I have it on so that you, I can hear you talk. No. Hope not . Want me glasses on to read that. Yeah. Is it switched on at the moment? Mm. Yeah. It's gonna be switched, it's gonna be switched on all the time I'm with you. Oh no! It is, it is er read, read it. I'm not talking. Come and sit down come and sit down. If you don't mind that is, I mean whoops! Luce! Who's that? That's a friend friend. It's just a friend Can I touch you? Will you allow me to touch you? Aye that's alright then isn't it eh? See, quite alright. Well you were wagging your tail when you were barking weren't you? Have you, have you er have you escaped the flu and all that? Well I've had the sniffles at the moment but we've had a lot of people at work with Yeah I know there's so much about isn't there? colds, flu, throat infections Having read that, can you play it back? Yes. We well ye yes I can but er obviously er I, I, I shan't be doing because erm I've got too many er hopefully too ma d it's much better, it would have been much better if I was living in a home, you see where, where we can holiday somewhere where we can just have it on all the time. But erm so no, no. A actually I visited somebody the other day and you just forget you just forget. No no no I mean i i it is completely anonymous anyway, Yes. I mean no er no one will know. I just wondered if you could erm play it back and Well I w w yes I mean obviously I need to so erm just to get it Right. right. O or to cut out, I mean if, if you said to me something that was de de confidential or, or anything like that, then, yes, er I mean that's it. You, you just Like if I started to swear at you. Well I'd leave that in of course Have a seat then somewhere or other. Thank you. We, we actually thought Heidi would be back by now, she went to a, a slumber party. Oh and they're slumbering rather a lot are they? Well it started at half past six last night . Oh. Mm. And she did have instructions for home by half past twelve but er mm she The erm er on the television last night there was a programme about the fifties that actually I didn't see it but I taped it and I have seen it this morning er On television? Mm. It was called erm tt it was about half past ten I think last night, somewhere Oh I was reading then. Er the trouble about the trouble with the fifties and er actually it was a very good programme er for reminiscing about the fifties. Michael Aspel was the one in er charge of it but you know a lot of the old people er and the old erm tt Muffin the Mule and the Fl Oh Flowerpot enjoyed watching, yeah the Flowerpot Men and er the skiffle groups and everything, it's quite good, you know, really nice Unless there's anything really special I don't tend to watch it late, I, I prefer to read. Well I er well I don't, I, but I put it on video er so I er had a look at it this morning. It's a nasty dreary morning isn't it? It is it is. Erm it was a nice okay, you can come then? Right, come on then. Let them know that you're my friend. There you are you see. I won't undermine your ego but it's perhaps the chair that she wants rather than you Ah ha don't do that . Is this your chair? Yeah. Well it's not hers No but you but like it do you? if Vicki's out at all she likes to erm sit in that chair. Have you been since we've had these new ones? We, we were trying to think when it was w that you came. But it took her such a long while before she would sit in one of these. No I don't know.

Well it's not exactly gonna be a U is it ? With them all stripping. No I wouldn't have thought it I wouldn't have thought it would have a corner shop to buy some chocolate and som box of matches, some sweets a magazine, a newspaper. Er all of us go to a shop of some sort pretty well every day. Now, including of course sundries. Now if you multiply that by the one million people living in Nottinghamshire you'll see that every day, all the year round, there are millions of sales taking place. Millions of transactions taking place. People buying and selling things. In the great majority of those cases nothing goes wrong. The customer goes away quite happy with their part of their transaction and the shop are quite happy with their part of it. And it's only in the minority of cases where things go wrong that come to the attention at the Trading Standards Department. Which means of course if you work for Trading Standards, as I did until very recently if you work for Trading Standards you tend to get a rather jaundiced view of shopping. All we ever hear about are disasters and complaints and things that have gone wrong. And we never hear about the thousands and thousands of sales that must take place every day where nothing's gone wrong at all. So Sounds like school. as I say Just like school. It does tend to get you rather jaundiced. And it is a refreshing change to t to talk to someone who's bought something from shop and they have no complaints whatever. Now as I say in round figures it's about twenty thousand just in this one county alone. Now what we have to do, in all those cases, is look at every one. First of all ask ourselves is this a genuine problem? Is it a real grievance? If it is how has it happened and who erm er who's to blame? Is it the customer's own fault? Is it the fault of the shop? Or are they both at fault? Quite honestly a lot of them do turn out to be the customer's own fault. You've probably heard the phrase the customer is always right but believe me it's not true. Er and anyone who works for Trading Standards will tell you it's not true. A lot of you'd be surprised how gullible a lot of people are and frankly a lot of shopping problems do turn out to be the shopper's own fault. For example a lot of people change their mind about wanting goods and decide I don't think I want that new pair of shoes after all. Or I don't think I want that new pair of jeans. I've taken a dislike to the colour. Er and what the law says is if you change your mind I'm afraid the law doesn't entitle you to anything at all. You're only entitled to money back if the goods are faulty in some way. There's got to be something actually wrong with the goods before you can claim money back. So there are a lot of people who change their mind. There are also a lot of people who damage or misuse things they bought from shops, usually clothes where people haven't bothered to read the washing instructions. And it might say do not dry clean and the customer has it dry cleaned and of course the garment is very likely going to be ruined. Or it might say hand wash only and the customer puts it in a washing machine. So again they wouldn't really be entitled to money back in cases like that. But there are a lot of problems which are the fault of the shop but we find these are usually caused by mistakes and misunderstandings. And we find that mistakes and misunderstandings are a far more common cause of complaint than deliberate dishonesty or someone trying to cheat you or rip you off. There are dishonest traders about unfortunately, just as I suppose there are dishonest people in most walks of life but we like to think that in Nottinghamshire they are in a s small minority. But they do exist. There are undoubtedly er rogues or cowboys about. Unscrupulous traders. Er and it is that minority of unscrupulous traders who make life very difficult for you and of course make life very difficult for Trading Standards. But most of the problems that we get are not caused by deliberate cheating, they're caused by genuine mistakes. What I'd like you to remember is this. People who work in shops are perfectly ordinary people, aren't they? Just like you and me. And we all make mistakes sometimes. Erm I freely admit that I do that myself. I've no doubt Bernard does. We all do. However efficient we think that we are, if we're honest with ourselves we have to admit we all sometimes make a mistake. And of course the same is true of shop assistants so do please make allowances for human error. And the next time you buy something from a shop and find there's something wrong with it don't just jump to conclusions that you've been deliberately cheated. You may have been of course. But it's much more likely to be due to human error. Now out of those four hundred complaints that we receive every week, if you take away all those which are the customer's own fault and all those which are caused by genuine mistakes you're still left with a lot of problems which are caused either by ignorance of the law or misinterpretation of the law. Do any of you know what the law is called that gives you your rights when you buy Consumer Protection Act. Sale of Goods Act. Pardon? Sale of Goods Act. Sale of Goods Act. Well done sir. Go to the top of the class. Sale of Goods Act. Right. Okay. Now, so, the name of the actual Act of Parliament is Sale of Goods Act er and that's the law that gives you and me and everybody in Britain our basic rights every time we buy something from a shop or in a sale or a market stall or by post through a mail order catalogue. It's called the Sale of Goods Act. Another phrase that's often used for the same thing is your statutory rights. So if you see that phrase written down anywhere you'll know it means Sale of Goods Act. That phrase, your statutory rights is often put in guarantees. I don't know whether you ever take the trouble to read the guarantee. I know a lot of people don't bother. For one thing they're often in very tiny print. For another they're often full of legal which is a bit difficult to sort out. But if you do read the guarantee you will nearly always find a sentence that says this guarantee does not affect your statutory rights. Have you ever noticed that? It's an interesting phrase that. You may have wondered well why is that phrase put in the guarantee? Well the reason it's put there is simply to remind you that the guarantee is always a plus or an extra. It's never intended to be a substitute or a replacement for your statutory rights. And even if you tore the guarantee up and threw it away erm a you've still statutory rights, anyway, given to you under the Sale of Goods Act. So a guarantee is totally separate and nothing to do really with your statutory rights. Now we've had a Sale of Goods Act in Britain for a long time. The first one came out in eighteen ninety three. So you could say for exactly a hundred years we've had a basic law designed to give us rights every time we go shopping. But despite the fact we've had that law for so long you'll find that not many people know about it . Erm it is if you like a closely guarded secret. Obviously the law has been updated since eighteen ninety three. The one we have now is called the Sale of Goods Act nin nineteen seventy nine. Now the Sale of Goods Act is good erm as far as it goes but it's by no means perfect and there are some loopholes in it that we'll have a look at in a moment. Right. So let's just have a look then at what our statutory rights are under the Sale of Goods Act. Erm and this is the reason why I brought this tape recorder, and I was saying to Bernard a moment ago, one of the most embarrassing things that can happen erm when talking to a group like this is when you pressed a button er whether it's a, a tape recorder a video machine or whatever, you pressed a button full of confidence in all the latest technology and there's an embarrassing silence. And I can, the number of times this has happened to me with school video machines is beyond belief. Erm I had one the other day where er it was s supposed to be, it was described as a brand new video machine and we got the most perfect picture, beautifully clear picture, but no sound whatever. Even when the sound button was pressed we couldn't get any sound volume m sound out of it whatever. So in the end I said to the chairman oh I'll, we'll leave the, we'll forget the video. I'll make do with slides. And I pressed the button of the slide projector again full of confidence. The first slide jammed straight away. Hopelessly jammed. And in trying to free the jammed slide the whole of the carousel tipped upside down and all my beautifully arranged slides all arranged the right way up and all in the right order all tipped all over the floor. So it was a pretty poor start really I felt to the talk. And then the class started to fight. And then the class started to fight. And I'm sure things like that don't happen in your school. Right. Er okay. Now. So we'll press this then full of confidence and see what happens. This is a typical problem that would come into one of our advice centres where a consumer has bought something,f failed to get any satisfaction from the shop and then has gone to the advice centre to er has found and tries to find the nearest Citizen's Advice Bureau or Advice Centre to try to get advice. Right. Well you all sat listening to that with riveted atten riveted attention . Erm let's just pause a moment there because there's a bit of legal language there that we need to sort out. First of all you will notice that the erm consumer adviser used the word contract which is an important word to remember. And I think that a lot of shoppers tend to forget that every time you buy anything from a shop, even if all you spent is ten pence, it doesn't matter how little money you've spent, but every time you buy anything from a shop you have a contract with the shop and the shop has a contract with you. As a result of that contract of course you have some rights er but the shop have some rights as well. I think one of the problems is, that a lot of shoppers don't realize that they're entering into a contract and we don't realize it for the simple reason that most people have, as soon as you hear the word contract you have a mental image of a legal document that you sign, don't you? If you, if you buy a house you sign a contract. And most people think that's what a contract is. But in shopping it's not like that is it? You wouldn't normally sign a legal document. Well I suppose you would if you were buying the goods on credit but normally, for an everyday transaction buying some food for example, you wouldn't normally sign a legal document. You might not even say anything if it's a self-service store. In a self-service store you choose the goods that you want. You take the goods to the checkout. You hand over your money at the checkout. The, the goods are then handed to you. You walk out of the shop and the goods are then your property. And it seems, on the face of it quite simple and quite straightforward doesn't it? But it's not as simple as it appears. Because just by that simple act of handing over your money at the checkout and receiving the goods in exchange, just by doing that, you have entered into a contract with the shop and as, as a result of that contract you've got the three rights which the consumer advisor mentioned on the tape. Let's, let's just have a look at what those phrases mean in plain Eng in plain English . Merchantable qualities. That phrase sounds a bit old-fashioned nowadays. The word merchantable isn't one that's, isn't normally used much today. It sounds old-fashioned because that's the phrase that's used in the original Sale of Goods Act of eighteen ninety three. I think today we would use a phrase like reasonable quality, satisfactory quality, or acceptable quality. So all that phrase means, in plain English, is that the goods should be of a reasonable standard and in particular it means that the goods should not be broken or damaged or faulty and whatever you've bought should work. It's very annoying isn't it if you buy something from a shop and find it won't work? Especially if you don't realize that till you've got, till you've got home and you realize you've got to go through all the hassle of going back to the shop to complain. So whatever you've bought shouldn't be broken or damaged or faulty and it should work. An example of that would be if you bought a new pocket calculator and then find it won't work then the legal position is the shop have broken their contract with you, because they've sold you a pocket calculator which is not of merchantable quality, and you should be entitled to money back in a case like that. But you, besides that you've got two other rights. You've got the right whatever you've bought should be as described, which brings us back to your problem of the C D described as Slavonic dances when really it was country and western. So again, the shop have broken their contract with you. Or if, what would be another example? If you bought some shoes described as leather and they turned out to be made of plastic then clearly you've bought some shoes which are not as described. A sheep if you buy a sheepskin coat from a market stall then it should be sheepskin not made of manmade fibres and not made of any other animal. Fit for the purpose. That phrase always makes me smile because er my wife recently bought a pair of tights with three legs in the tights. And I assure you she would have every right to go back to the shop and say look these tights are not fit for their purpose. Er but seriously that phrase doesn't just mean fit for the purpose in the general sense, it also means fit for the purpose in any particular sense you had made known to the shop. For example if you went into a bicycle shop and said can you sell me a bike suitable for a seven year old child? Well that, I think that was a quite specific request. Or if you went into a D I Y shop, not me because I'm the world's worst D I Y person. But if you did and said can you sell me some erm emulsion paint, which is non-drip, and they sell you some matt paint, which drips, then clearly they've sold you something which was not fit for the purpose that you had specified. So those three things are called your statutory rights and you've got them as long as you buy the goods from a shop or a trader or someone who's in business. Alright? Erm but, and this is a very big but, if you buy privately erm you don't have those three rights any more. Buying privately means if you buy from an ordinary member of the public not a shop. For example the classified ads column in the Nottingham Evening Post. The column where people advertise second hand bikes, second hand sewing machines, second hand cars and all the rest of it. Where you're not buying from a trader, you're buying from an ordinary member of the public. We call that buying privately. If you buy privately you lose that right straight away. And you also lose that. So what it means is if you buy privately instead of having three statutory rights you've only got one. So you'll see straight away erm by buying privately your, your legal protection is far more limited than it was before. A good example of that is a car. If you buy a second hand car from a car dealer you would have your three statutory rights under the Sale of Goods Act. But a lot of people buy a second hand car privately, and there are pages of these in the Nottingham Evening Post every day you know where people are paying a few hundred pounds, or it may be a few thousand pounds, for a second hand car. Now if you do that the only right you've got, in law, is that the car should be as described. That would mean that any statement made about the car should ha w should be true. For example a statement about the number of miles it's done, or the number it's had. Those statements should be true but erm you wouldn't have the right that it was of merchantable quality. So you'll see straight away, frankly, you haven't got much legal protection if you buy privately. And if you do buy a car privately and it turns out to have problems with it, there is very little, if anything the Trading Standards Department could do to help you. Erm simply because your rights are so limited. Could I just a Yes. ask a question there? Yes. Do. difference between a trader and a private person. Yes. You know you read the, the columns and you buy a second hand car and you buy one this week and you read the column next week Yes. and you see the same telephone number,you know different model Well it is and so it goes on. it is sim because of the big difference between the Sales Of Goods Act and buying privately, for that reason it is an offence for a trader erm to pretend not to be a trader. If I can put it that way. Now you'll find there are a lot of perfectly honest traders in the Evening Post and the honest ones have put T in brackets to indicate that they are a trader. Now an unscrupulous one will, as I've said, will pretend not be a trader. Now that is an offence and the Trading Standards keep a very, and, and of course the Evening Post themselves, keep a very close check on those phone numbers and it's much easier to do it nowadays with computers. We keep a close check on all those phone numbers to find out, are there any traders masquerading as private sellers. But that's an important point. But do remember, what we've talked about so far is the Sale Of Goods Act. But when buying a car, or anything from a trader, you are also protected by another law called the Trade Descriptions Act which, and we've had that law since nineteen sixty eight. So we've had that law for a long time. What the Trade Descriptions Act says is it's a criminal offence for any trader to describe his goods in a false or misleading way. Okay? So if for example a dishonest car dealer said bargain, thirty thousand miles only, when really it had done ninety thousand miles then that would be a criminal offence under the Trade Descriptions Act. Because he's claiming the car is something which it clearly is not. Or if a jeweller said, you know, the rings in my window are made of gold when really they were not made of gold at all, then that would be a false trade description. On the streets of Nottingham, just before last Christmas, there was some street traders selling coats er which they described as sheepskin. We suspected they were not made of sheepskin at all er and we took some of them away and analyzed them to find out what exactly are they made of. And they turned out to be made of manmade fibres. So those gentlemen were not only infringing the Sale of Goods Act they were committing a criminal offence as well by infringing the Trade Descriptions Act so they ended up being prosecuted by Trading Standards. But I, I do feel the Trade Descriptions Act is a is a very important er piece of consumer protection designed of course to protect not only you and me as consumer but also designed to protect traders against unfair trading practices. Excuse me. Can you tell me erm how that applies, say if you went and bought an i article of clothing from a market stall Yes. and there were no facilities for you try it on Yes. and when you got it home you found it didn't fit? Yes. What are your rights then? If you buy from a market stall that counts as b that counts in exactly the same way as buying from any other er high street retailer. So in other words you're covered by the, well you're covered by both the Sale of Goods Act and the Trade Descriptions Act. So, but where I know it is a bit difficult with clothes because a market stall erm you don't, you don't normally get a chance to try the clothes on erm and you're never absolutely sure are these clothes, is this garment going to fit or not? So I, I always think it, feel it's a good idea to say to the stallholder, stallholder look, erm if I take this home and try it on and find it won't, doesn't fit can I bring it back? And if I can what are you going to offer me? And I think it's much better to get a clear understanding from the market stall at that stage rather than leave it till later. Okay? M I mean, let's be fair I mean most of the stallholders that I've found in Nottinghamshire erm are perfectly honest and reputable and many of them been there many years anyway. And of course if they're doing the job probably should be licensed by the local authority in any case. The real problem comes, not from market stalls, the real problem comes from these people who sell things out of suitcases. You know alleged to be gold or silver from suitcases. Now what should make you very suspicious is a soon as a policeman appears they disappear like lightning. Now that, that should w alert you that, hallo, there's something very fishy here. So do be very wary please about buying anything from a street trader. Now let's just have a look at some problem areas. Er oh, before we do that let's just n just listen to a few more seconds of this tape. So I think you'll agree those two things are important as well. That if you change your mind remember you're not entitled to anything. And the other point made by the consumer adviser is try to have a good look at what you've chosen before you walk out of the shop. Now I know that's easier said than done. You can't always do it but try to if you can. Because what the Sale of Goods Act goes on to say is that if the goods contain a fault which is so obvious you should have noticed the fault while you were in the shop, or the shop assistant pointed out the fault to you while you were in the shop, then I don't think you can really demand money back on that basis. So what it means is, you've got to have wits about you when you go shopping haven't you? I'm sure you've said this to your, your class before now. Use your wits. Use your commonsense. Use your gumption as they say in Yorkshire and above all pay attention to the way in which the goods are described to you. If the goods are described to you as seconds, shopsoiled, slightly imperfect, if any phrase like that is used I think your own commonsense should tell you there's something wrong with these goods and that presumably is the reason why they're reduced in price. You've just answered the question. I've just answered the question, okay. So the way in which goods are described's important. Now then erm time is an important part of shopping problems isn't it? People often say to me how much time have I got in which I can complain about faulty goods? Er and I wish I could give you, you know, a nice clear cut, definite answer but the Sale of Goods Act is rather vague on that point. And that I think, I feel is one of the loopholes in the Sale of Goods Act, because it doesn't lay down a definite time limit. All it says is if you do buy something from a shop and realize it's faulty, what you should do is take it back to the shop who sold it to you, together with your receipt if you've still got it or some other proof of purchase. Do that as soon as you can and within a reasonable time, says the Sale of Goods Act. Now the problem comes of course, well that's all very well but how do you define what is a reasonable time? Because I think, what is a reasonable time, is going to vary from one product to another. With shoes, I would say you'd normally know pretty quickly. Are the shoes faulty or not? Because if the shoes are faulty they're going to pretty quickly feel very uncomfortable. With shoes I think you're going to know pretty quickly. But if it's something mechanical, like a car, erm stereo equipment, erm a home computer something like that, a washing machine, it could be a long time before a mechanical fault became apparent. So what is a reasonable time to complain will, I think, vary from one product to another. So the only general advice I can give you is you do need to act promptly. If you find some if you realize you've bought something and it's faulty return it to the shop who sold it to you as soon as you can. The quicker you do that the better chances will be of getting your money back. But the longer you leave it the worse your chances are going to get . Because there must come a point somewhere in time where the shop will say well you've now had these goods so long they're no longer our responsibility. They're your responsibility. If we take the simple example of shoes. If, if you buy a p a new pair of shoes and realize they're faulty and you go back the next day and say I bought these shoes from you yesterday, I've still got my receipt, I believe the shoes are faulty, can I have my money back? I think you'll agree you're in a much stronger position that if you left it for months, and then went back. You know I think that weak does weaken your case considerably. So time is an important part of all this. Erm I've got a heading here, sales. A lot of people here think they have no rights when buying goods in a sale and it's quite mistaken to think that, you've still, even though you bought the goods in a sale you should still have your three statutory rights. In fact as far as the law is concerned it's really irrelevant that you bought the goods in a sale. All that matters as far as the law is concerned is, did you buy the goods from a shop? If you did, are the goods faulty? And were they faulty at the time that you the shop sold then to you? That's all that really matters as far as the law is concerned. Erm it is quite unfair, and illegal, for a shop to try to duck out of their responsibilities to you by pointing to a sign that says no refunds, no money refunded. No money refunded on sale goods. All those signs are illegal. And when you think about it they must be illegal, cos if a shop puts up a sign saying no money refunded they are, are trying to take away your statutory rights. You should always be entitled to a refund provided the goods are faulty. That's the point. So don't be put off by a sign that says no money refunded. They, they pardon? What about the ones where they say well we'll repair it for you? Or we'll put it right for you? Well they can certainly offer you a repair, and of course if you wish to have a repair done that's entirely up to you. You can choose that if you wish. But if the goods are faulty what you're entitled to by law is money back. A cash refund in other words. So that you're, in other words you either, you're, by having the money back in your hand you are then restored to the position you were in before you bought the goods in the first place. All you're en all you can insist on, all you can demand is money back. Now if the shop want to offer you an alternative that's up to them and you can of course accept if you wish. Erm but all you can demand is money back. Okay? S some shops put conditions on that, don't they? The they say things like no refunds given unless you produce a valid receipt. Now when I shop Well I keep the valid, a receipt Yeah. and I've realized that. I'm asking what's the legal position in that? I think, I think a shop, if you look at from the shop's point of view erm I think it is quite understandable and natural that they would, they would either like a receipt or at least they would like to see some evi Proof of purchase. some evidence Mm. that you bought the goods from them, I think that's reasonable. Yes I, I, I accept Erm that. I just Yeah. wondering what the legal position was on that. Are they legally entitled to say that in fact? They are legally entitled to say either a receipt or some other evidence of purchase . Right. Fine But what I'm, what I'd like to stress to you is don't abandon hope erm sounds like a religious text actually. Don't abandon hope just because you think oh dear, I can't find my receipt. Mm. Because in practice there are alternative ways of proving purchase aren't there? Mm. I mean if you've still got the original bag or the wrapper or, or the box or the price Yeah. tag. In practice a lot of shops will accept that. If you paid by cheque or credit card, again you would have some evidence that you spent that money. We had a problem with the electrical place, Dixons erm over something rather different like that. We bought our daughter a, a cassette player one Christmas erm she opened it, threw the box away. Four days later it packed up. Dixons refused to exchange it because we didn't return it in the original packaging. They did exchange it in the end but I had to be very insistent and it took three months. Mm. Mm. They said that I should return it in its box, with the receipt. I didn't have the box. I did have the D receipt. You did have the receipt? Oh yes. Well I, I think that should have been sufficient myself . Mm. It was in the end but it took Yeah. letters to Head Office to Yes. do it. Yes. And I think you'll agree, it is a difficult I mean I always stress this point about attitude, that a lot of problems that we get in our advice centres have been made worse because the customer has caused er you know argument or a scene Mm. in the shop. Erm and it does make it very difficult then for Trading Standards then to pick up the pieces. And I know it's very easy for me to stand here and say you know try to keep calm and polite and reasonable. And that brings us back to your point, that there are times when you, you, you know you have, in order to get your statutory rights you've got to be pretty firm. And I feel that it, it is a difficult bala in practice it is difficult balance to achieve, to be polite, but to be firm at the same time erm but and there are times when that has to be done. . Now while we're on this point about what exactly am I entitled to, erm we ought to say a word about credit notes cos there are a lot of shops who say well erm you know it is it isn't company policy to, it isn't our policy to offer refunds, but we're quite happy to offer you a credit note. A lot of customers accept that because they don't really know what their statutory rights are. But that brings us back to the point we were stressing a moment ago, if the goods are faulty you're entitled to money back, a cash refund. Er you need only accept a credit note if the problem is your own fault in some way. For example if you've changed your mind and decide you didn't want the goods or if you had damaged the goods and the shop offer you a credit note, I think you really have to accept that with good grace, cos it is really your fault. But if the goods are faulty you'd have the right to decline the credit note and ask for money back. I if I could just come in there you mentioned this er if you changed your mind on goods, and you seemed to be defining the legal position. You've got you know some of the well known er shops like Marks and Spencers who will take things back and don't ask for a . Yes. Is this just Yes. a matter of customer ? With Marks and Spencers it is a matter of customer relations. They, they are going beyond what they have to do by law, and all credit to them for doing that. But the reason why they do that of course is they would like you to keep coming back and trading with them as a happier and satisfied customer. After all a reputable retailer doesn't want a lot of dissatisfied customers walking about. He'll want you, quite naturally, to keep on trading with him. But, and, but Marks and Spencers are really going, and there are plenty of other firms beside them who do it, but they are going beyond what they strictly have to do by law. Er but there are of course h n while we're on that point there are, I'm afraid, there are s people who take advantage of Marks and Spencers, erm because they know there's going to be no problem about having goods exchanged so what they do, they buy something from Marks and Spencers wear it on one evening for, for a party or special occasion take it back the next day and it's th they get the money back Now none of you would dream of doing anything like that. Thank you for that. I'll Erm with, with sales Yes. er very often in the shop it says no refund on, on sale goods Yeah. now i if that is strictly wrong why do the shops put the sale notices up? Well as I've said signs like that are illegal. If you do see a sign like that please, or any words that mean the same thing, like no refunds, no money refunded, no money refunded on sale goods any of those phrases, will you please let Trad your nearest Trading Standards Office know. And we will get the sign taken down. They are, are allowed to put a sign that say no goods exchanged. Or it might say no sale goods exchanged. That's, that's okay, that's within the law. But no money refunded is not within the law. Alright? Mm. So do please let, bring it to the attention of Trading Standards. Since, yes, since you can't exchange the goods then No because you don't have a legal right to have the goods exchanged. But you can take it back and say I want my money? You can. Yes. Yeah. Erm but there are a few what I call golden rules to avoid becoming one of these four hundred people every week who come into our advice centre . I would say golden rule number one is keep receipts. Very important. Unfortunately you can't insist on having a receipt because there's no law that says shops have got to give receipts. Perhaps there ought to be a law like that, but there isn't at the moment. So you can't demand one but you can always ask way round that? You can say can I have a receipt please? There is one way round that. Right. If they're VAT registered Yeah. and you insist on a VAT receipt VAT receipt. Yes. they have got to give you one. Okay? Er it is important as I've said about, we were talking a moment ago Pardon? about evidence of purchase. No. Erm They have got to give a receipt It is important because if you do buy something from a shop and realize there's something wrong with it, if you take it back the first thing the shop would say to you is can I see your receipt? Or they may say have you any proof of purchase? You don't need to hoard them for years, I know some people who hoard receipts for years. Every five years or so have a glorious clear out and throw all the old Y you don't need to get to quite to those lengths but er you certainly do need to keep them for a while. What I mean by that is er try to have a good look at what you've chosen before you walk out the shop. Now that was the point I made a few moments ago. Legal documents, by that I mean be very wary of signing any kind of legal document in a shop. Let's take the example of a cooker. If you decide you want to a buy a new cooker and you go to the Gas Showrooms or the Electricity Showrooms and say I'd like to buy that cooker there and I would like to spread the payments over time, normally nowadays twenty four months or thirty six months. Nothing wrong with that it's a perfectly er respectable and reputable way of shopping, provided of course you know what you're doing and you d you don't get carried away. But, but a lot of the problems that come into our advice centre have been caused by people signing erm credit agreements and then realizing they can't afford the payments. Now to go back to the example of the cooker, if you do say that in the showrooms you will certainly be asked to sign a legal document. A credit agreement. But be very careful, because once you've signed it it becomes a legally binding document it will be very difficult to back out of it. You'll need a solicitor to get out of it believe me. If you sign the document in your own home, as you would do with a doorstep salesman, er then the law does give you a chance to change your mind, although I hope for goodness sake you would all be very wary about signing any kind of legal document thrust under your nose from a doorstep salesman. But if you did that the law does give you what they call a cooling off period. What a lovely phrase. They give you a cooling off period of seven days in which you can change your mind, have second thoughts, and cancel the credit agreement. But you don't have that privilege, I'm afraid, if you sign it in Gas Showrooms, Electricity Showrooms or a shop so be very careful Or Tenerife. Or Tenerife. So do be very careful about that. Right. Now the case of checking, the case of checking the goods number two there. Yes. That's increasingly difficult these days with shrink-wrapping and It is. I agree. Yes. And it always annoys me when I want to buy a shirt, that men's shirts are usually all sealed up in a package with a multitude of pins Yeah. and it's very difficult to have a close look at the shirt without taking the whole thing to Mm. pieces. So you take it pieces. But er You can it to pieces I don't w I don't want the package did that What all I wanted . Yes. But if you can do that try and do that. Now this leaflet which I'm going to give you in a moment er is called How To Put Things Right which i i is quite a good title for a leaflet like this. How to put things right. But perhaps a better title might be how to prevent things going wrong, on the argument you know that prevention is better than cure and rather than trying to put problems right which have already happened, it might be better to try to prevent them happening in the first place. And I do feel that by just following a few simple rules like that we can avoid a lot of the problems that come into our advice centre. Now I want to allow a bit more time for questions so I'll just end if I may with a funny story which, didn't happen to me, it happened to a colleague of mine, erm a young lady, who went to give er a talk like this to group of adults like yourselves and at the end of the meeting the treasurer went up to her and said do we owe you any fee or expenses? No thank you she said. No fee and no expenses. Ah, thank you very much, she said we're very appre very much appreciate the fact that you've given up your time to come and talk to our members you see we can't afford to pay for really good speakers whereupon of course she off . Right. Well thank you very much for listening and if there are any more questions I'll be very pleased to . Okay. Thanks John. Right. Finally Th the legal documents you know th going back to the cooker. Do you have the right to take the documents out to look at them a and read them? Because if you're buying something like Yes. that in a shop it's extremely difficult to go through all the Yes. bits and pieces and Mm mm. Yes. realize what you're doing. But if I remember correctly on one of the progr on television going back sort of two three months ago, one of the firms, and I think it was an electrical firm, was working a bit of a swift one erm they were getting people to sign a document which purported I think to be erm l l loaning money, hire agreement. But it wasn't actually, it were something else, and people were finding that their goods were repossessed because they couldn't keep up the payments. Mm. Now can you take the documents ? Certainly and I, that's a good very point, a very good question. Erm let's face it it can be very tempting when the salesman thrusts the document under your nose, just sign here sir or just sign here madam, just a formality you understand, erm we'll fill in we'll fill in the details later. It's very, it's very tempting, especially if it's something that you badly want as happened to me recently when I'd set my heart on buying a new erm video recorder. And I thought to myself if all I've got to do is put my signature on this piece of paper and without actually paying any money down, any cash down at all, I can a actually walk out of the shop carrying the video recorder. And it is very tempting when you've set your heart on something like that. And v very tempting indeed. But you're, but you're quite right you, you certainly, you certainly have the right to say look, you know, rather than signing this now er I do need some time to think I mean let's face it there's a load of s If you turn it over on the back of the credit agree the next meeting in March, with very good reason, it clashes with a conference that needs to attend so we're proposing, with your agreement, that we put it forward a week to the seventeenth of March, is that a problem for anybody? When? Same time, ten thirty. Possibly for me, Could you just let us know? Yes thank you. Right When, when is The seventeenth of March. What's on the twenty second, Harry? It was on the twenty second, we're putting it forward a week, That's not a week, five day week, well, five day week. Okay, Right, Harold, you can start your recorder if you wish now. Apologies for absence? Chairman, apologies from Sue , Mr , and Mr . Who are, as you probably all know, erm, in London, or on their way to London, lobbying, I hope successfully, but I fear probably not,said he, keeping an eye on the tape recorder trying to get more money out of the government in regard to our backing in this, and we wish you well. It's supported by our local M P, so I believe, well it's okay, minutes of the previous meeting which was held on the twelfth of October, and I'll sign them as a true and accurate version. This takes us into item three, this is the provision of service land,er, the updating report, Chairman, I've these past, the contract for the on-site services has now been let by, by the County Council's private ent department, they're actually going in the present time. , that contract is now completed, the infrastructure contract on site itself has been let, and er, we have now resolved all the, the issues that were on that site, and effectively we've already sold two of the plots off that site before . Details of those are on plot two. The Tern Valley business park, Chairman, the er, the management board met to have a look at the site, we're getting some demand for some smaller plots have turned down, and there is the proposal that was considered by the, the management but was turned down, to put in a little round, er, so we could rate some of the plots at the bottom of the site in, to er,mark out the plots rather than pull any plots erm, if the construction of them would be funded from, from selling plots in that area. Recommendations, Chairman, just to note the report, and to ratify the decision of the Tern Valley management body, about the construction of a on that site. Where is in relation to this? Well, if I can check it on the plan, it's, the plan actually shows half the site, there's the central slide way way coming down through the development site, all that occupies, all one side of the slide way. Yes, right Any other questions, accept the report. Item four, a lot of these, I think you'll find, are items which are purely for information. It's important that they keep me abreast of what's happening, paper C. A power to advance, Chairman. All the er, all the units are let, we've had two, we've had notice of two terminations coming up, but we have actually got a waiting list for units so I don't think we'll have any problem in filling those. Interestingly, all, all eighteen units on that site have been full from the day they were created, and that's been a most successful run. we've come, we've had to make at previous meetings, Chairman, about the er, about the fall off we've had in demand for the small units there now. We've actually had a pick up, there's been a sort of renewed interest, er, it's quite significant that over the last month or so, there's been quite an increase in, in people making enquiries about those units. We have actually let four of the units, two have gone to a department of Council for a service they're delivering in the area, er, but actually it's a manufacturing type of operation that they're running there so it's, that, that, you know, is in keeping with the nature of the units, and the other two units have gone elsewhere. I think that's really quite positive, that we see erm, that we see an increase in demand coming about in them areas. , the Alberney units erm, have never been successful since the time they were, they were constructed. The maximum, I think we've ever let at any one time is three of the six units, we're currently down only to one unit there at Alberney. Sandy Lane, we're now erm, we're down to eleven of the eighteen units occupied at Sandy Lane. Right, members will recall from the last meeting,there was an issue of it at Shrewsbury College, because of the transfer of the screw and ribbon factory to the college, or the College's claim to the transfer of the screw and ribbon factory to them, because of the er, the cre the vesting of the College as an in independent body under the Higher Education Act. We've had some discussion with the College to seek to resolve this, and the proposals erm, are set out in paragraph four, three, er, in that it would mean that the College would not take over the ownership of the site, er, and it, but, but they would continue to occupy their part of the site er, effectively rent free from the County Council, but if, at any time, they decided they, the College wanted to move away from the site, it would revert to the County Council, it wouldn't actually become a College asset. I think probably Chairman, it's the best deal that we could get in the circumstances. I think, Chairman, that's still subject to approval by the E A B, erm, which is at the end of the day, the important party that has to be satisfied, so, these are very successful negotiations, but we, we're still awaiting erm, confirmation they've been accepted. By whom? By the Education Assets Board. Who are they? A government body, and if, if, if at the end of the day, there is, there is still disagreement between us and the E A B, er, then there, there is an appeal to the Secretary of State, but erm, we're hoping that the E A B may accept these proposals. Terence, it's just a very small point, Yes, you see he agreed to contribute to a suitable replacement upon terms that we agreed, what happens if terms aren't, can't be agreed? I mean, Who's, who's going to agree the terms? Well, it would be between the County Council and the College, I mean I, I can't envisage the situation that we would actually serve notice on the, on the College to leave the site and therefore trigger that part of the agreement. But the minute, the minute the College simply agreed, at least they've agreed to close for ten million pounds at least if they don't agree, what would happen then? Well we, if, this only happens if we wish them to vacate the site, and what it is is to jump to a suitable Oh no it isn't we intend to redevelop the site And if a suitable replacement for the facilities they've got now, Chair, where, where erm, agreements er, leave things open wherever possible, the courts will interpret them as the parties intended to act reasonably one to the other, and er, if there were a formal agreement and that was then tested it would be a matter for the courts to decide what was reasonable, obviously asking for, what was it you're suggesting, ten million? Would be regarded as unreasonable, there'll be no question of that being enforced, but er, clearly where the thing's left open there, there's some room for manoeuvre in negotiation eventually and settlement if need be before the courts. Okay, we're asked to approve these terms in para four three, is anyone backing it? Okay. Five, inward investment activities to pay the deed. Just the report to, to note, Chairman. Er, Er, just one question er, Chairman, that we have success to report on that, though I can't go into details. Erm, members who are also members of the Business Grants Panel will recall that at the December meeting we agreed to grant to to a company so he may relocate into the area creating twenty seven jobs, and Friday we learnt that relocation's to go ahead to Telford. To Telford, two companies, that the policy's helped. Right, local report? Chairman, Chairman, there's erm, where, where's, can I ask where that funding's coming from? Of course Locating from Telford. The West Midlands Conurbation. From the West Midlands? Erm, on this paper I just wanted to ask you, erm, Simon says it's from the erm, American agency, how many jobs, I, I would really like to know how much we spend, or how much is spent on trying to achieve jobs from American, from companies in America, and erm, how many jobs have been created? I only say this, because it's always been very difficult to get erm, America to take any, any interest at all in developing in England, and , how and I'd wondered if it's still the same situation . With all due respect to have an obsession to getting American viewpoint to erm, set up in England, and I would just like to know how much it really comes to? I thought there were two answers to that, madam, through the Chair, er, the first is that we don't actually spend any money directly ourselves, as a County Council in America, we contribute towards the Regional Development Organization, the W M D A, and our contribution is about twenty thousands pounds per year. Erm, which is a very proportion of their costs, it's mostly funded by the D T I, and some private sector investment. They in turn, have consultants in Japan, erm, in Europe, and in the United States, and their particular consultant in America happens to be in Pittsburg, run by this chap called Simon who, by the way we feel is, is very effective and very good at his job. The second part of the question, erm, how do we evaluate it, is extremely difficult. Erm, we get er, leads, unfortunately they become available across the whole of western Europe or the whole of Britain, and we don't have hundreds of successes from America. It's clear they come one every so often, as the one from Germany, but when they do come, they're very worthwhile, it justifies our effort. I can't give you a figure now, on how many American firms there are in the county, erm, but I can do some work on it and come back to you. I would like, Chairman, to know, because er, it always seems to me that unnecessary money is spent in, in the American lead, so it's difficult to get any money. I don't know who's our representative to , and I think, I can and erm, I just, yes, I mean Europe yes, the Far East, yes, but are, is, a waste of money? My recollection, and I'm speaking from memory, and I could be wrong, but I think that the last time I looked at lists of the various companies in Telford, where I'm obviously more concerned, not, well, that's not to mean I'm not concerned elsewhere, but I'm more familiar with respect to them, my recollection is that the more American than anything else on that site. It's been certainly true er, Chair, that America has been the largest source of inward investment in this country consistently. I mean, ranking of the countries descending as business in the way it changes, and Japan comes first, Germany's gone down in recent years because of that trouble, but America has consistently been the major investor in this country. Not always noticed because if it's called Cements it doesn't look like a foreign company, but if it's called Mitsubishi or something well, it will stand out. But it is worth attacking as a target market, simply because of its size. Could The great, I mean, you've a valid point and I think it's due to the recession in America, I think we were disappointed were we not Bruce, that the results of our trip to er, New York State, and this has nothing to do with the enthusiasm of the business people we met there, everything to do, in my view, with the fact that the recession, and America's been through a very tough recession, they just don't look to expand elsewhere, but the reaction we had in, in er, in America was very, very powerful of, of a wish to want to do something when things look better. One of the, one of the, I think what perhaps American companies have, I have asked David to go upstairs and get the list of foreign companies operating in Shropshire, so we can actually see how many American companies there are, among, among, throughout the county. I think one of the things the American companies often do is that, rather than set up on a green field site, they often buy into an existing company, erm, and therefore it's, it's, it's a, it's a somewhat different form of investment to the Like Clarke Pardon? Like Clarke Fuller's Well, I think, erm, McConnell er, McConnell to let them Mm, McConnell to let them, have been bought by an American company as well then. So there is a flow of American source in, but less I think in terms of building a new factory on green field, a green site, and more of erm, buying an existing operation And, and, which might continue employment, which doesn't actually create extra employment. Sometimes it creates extra,sure Erm, I, I, I didn't say the question lightly it's just that I there's been constant obstruction for two years. There's a supplementary estimate here. I'm delighted to have given them two er security men does it mean security men are now available for all the county? If any of us have got troubles at our schools where there's vandalism, will you provide us, at the tax payer's expense,with a security man? You pour the money into this, it's bounced back on you but as usual there is no limit. I've heard members from the other side say money doesn't matter this is democracy. This is what the people want and money must not interfere with their wishes. That only seems to apply in the Highfields area. I suggest that the Labour and particularly Liberal feel, think very carefully about the quality of service that is provided by this county er council cos at the moment there is neither justice or equity in it. There are areas that are just what they want things passed on the hoof. left, right and centre when anyone else outside these areas wants it we're told no money, no capital, can't be spent this year, wipe it off and I think you should be very careful or you might have a backlash where you least want it. Thank you. Mr Thank you Chairman. Erm I think really for Mr to talk about washing of hands er he's got some brass neck when I remember every year, every year I mean hopefully he won't be able to do this next year, what does he say it's your budget and he looks over there your budget, you implement it. If that's not washing of hands I'm not too sure what is. Er, Chairman erm, I do believe that this has always been an issue erm of vested interests and bureaucracy administration but all I want to say to members of the council today as a member of the youth and community advisory committee is that extremely serious er far reaching decisions are gonna have to be taken because we were told at the last meeting of that sub committee that just to stand still because of the changes in legislation regarding transfer of funds to the er F E funding council, we will lose a further two million pounds next year so even if we er do not have to find any cuts within our own budget that money is going out of this authority's budget it may come back in in commissioning agreements but because of the different timescale that the funding council works on we probably won't know that when we come to set our budget and really the issue for the Labour group I think in particular as councillor has said, is the question of budgetary control. Because I I would say that all members of the council face those kinds of cuts. Faced with those kind of possible reductions in service, if there is a penny one penny more than necessary spent on administration and bureaucracy wherever it is in the youth and community programme that is gonna be less money for front line vision and the Labour group can have to think very, very carefully about that and the issue is gonna be that if we're spending too much money or if they're coming back to supplementary estimates which won't be available er given the financial situation next year if we're having two heads of centres or whatever when we could have one that is gonna mean less money for front line services to the people of Highfields and there'll only be one group that will be responsible for that, if that does come about and I think that's something that we all need to bear in mind because what we were told as members of that committee is that the youth and community budget is gonna be in for some very serious times in the future and it's mainly the government's fault because of the way they've decided to re-organise the situation it's going out of our hands into the control of an unelected body and like most members of this council I think we would oppose that but that's the reality of the situation and I could not support any increase of funds er for any community centres if I knew it was simply gonna be spent on administration. Thank you. Mr Could I have Mr Chairman cos it's a, is it an order of government to support Mr at the same time or should I do . No just deal with this and let their deal with the amendment as it is. As it is. I'm sorry come again clarify I said would it,in order now just to deal with the amendment on my own sir or support Mr at the same time? We've only got this one. No we've got the other amendment but it's not been moved yet. It's not been moved. No you'll have to deal with this one because the other one has not been moved yet. Right, I'll deal with this one I I'll deal with this one and be very careful as I say. I I wanted to make three points really. Er, I did at the last council urge that we actually needed to break the deadlock my er a and I thought that was very important. I was ruled out of order, I erm I there were point out then that twenty five new councillors and I understand it wasn't legitimate if I wanted to to restrict the vote only to those twenty five so that the rest of you would actually realise that this has gone on far too long, I only put that as a I think it is very, very important erm that we break new ground. At the last council meeting we did two things or two things have happened. One, we set up a w er er a working group which has brought together that consultation addressed that consultation argument and I would point out that Mr amendment er does clearly enshrine that as obviously something which is now seen as useful, er and I think that's important. The thing I don't like about this amendment is it actually moves us nowhere and we cannot after what we've seen over the summer, move nowhere. Now those of us who've been involved on the Moat Highfields sub committee will have a need to know that when we were faced with really serious and horrendous problems, we found when faced with the reality and a great deal of detailed information, that an extraordinary amount of three party cooperation was achieved. It resulted in the erm extra requirement for security which does happen to which Mr has referred and I I think it's it's very very important to realise that if that three party cooperation can be achieved as it should be, bearing in mind what Simon says that we are going to have to do this, with horrendous problems in the youth and community project in the future and we would be failing completely in our duty, not just to the people of Highfields,but to the people of this whole county if we simply allowed politics, as has been done in the past, to lead to entrenched positions and the idea of simply saying to the director, we are in a mess therefore will you please deal with it all is I think wildly irresponsible and I'm very very surprised indeed that erm that point should be put. The reasoned, the reasoned proposals which are contained in a very thought out amen which has in fact contains ideas submitted by many different people of different persuasions to try and ensure that ideas could be erm worked at solidly does break the endless delays. It means that there is a way of going forward, the only question that remains was that head of project as Professor said who is in their right mind would want to erm, apply for such a job at the moment, it's probably an unworkable idea. If in the future the single management committee on the two headed centre decide that they want a single headed project then only Pharuk hearing which I always subscribe to that it should be decided locally, they may have that said project I'm sure you'd agree, if they choose to have such one, if they feel that they need it, but we want to ensure, do we not, and the amendment doesn't do this that we actually get a move on, that we spend the money we have, what little there is and there is very little on delivering the services, that we fuse the bureaucracy which is clearly contained in the other and, clearly contained, it's spelt out in in in in tablets of stone in a way that's never been done before. It is extremely positive it sta , it clears these points up and and answers most of these questions so I would urge Mr Chairman that to on sheer education, on terms of provision of services, I'm not party to all of the politics , I agree with what you said, absolutely crazy. I would however I I with great trepidation as I don't think I've ever dared do it before, er is try to actually clarify the thoughts of my leader erm it is not erm, have I your permission erm I I I feel I feel he may, I feel that may have been a professional slip of the tongue i in saying that now be up to Labour, it is not up to Labour at all, it is up to all of u , it is up to all of us, it is up to all of us all, and you and you and you, you can't dump responsibility, it is up to all of us, all of us to work together and deliver an effective result because nobody gains anything in the eyes of the people of this county by allowing this thing to go on and on and on and what they feel is if we can't get to grips with it what on earth are we doing with our existence. That is why the amendment is a far, far better thing than this rather grubby amendment we have before us. Mr Thank you Mr Chairman. I've followed the events of of this erm unhappy but hardy perennial some time now erm I've found it unusual because there was no Liberal volte face until now and er quite a lot of things happened where the Liberals changed their mind and I naturally started to wonder what has happened to make this change of mind come about and all I'll say is I hope that it doesn't have much to do with events in other counties or with any by-election. Ooh, ooh, at least we have a mind. Thank you yes, are there I think this is unique er a unique occasion where we haven't got a Labour speaker so if there's no Labour speaker then Right, we'll press on those in ing I accept that. But Put those against. Those against the amendment is lost just. We now move have we another amendment? Yes the purple paper. The purple paper the mover please. Mr I've been I've been advised chair that I've made the same mistake as you did so. They're so particular aren't they sometime but there you are Chair, Chairman I'm grateful er from the indications that have been already made by a number of speakers that they are amenable to the contents of this amendment. Can I can I say before I do launch into the amendment to Mr that you have played your card at the last election and the Leicestershire public has resoundedly given their answer to your particular policies. So I don't think anyone here as an elected member, needs to defend their positions if they wish to move from a political or a bureaucratic policy to something which is more pluralist and much more representative of the kind of policies that this council should be discussing not only now but also in the future. No one has to defend anything to anyone. Chair and and at the same time can I say that you do not equate elitist views and pleasures and pastimes that they may have down in the county somewhere with the kind of deprivation that people face in the inner cities. You do not equate that, it is irresponsible and I'm s , I'm sorry that the these remarks were made earlier. Chairman, can I say briefly that the merger and I'm quite pleased that we've finally er there is a death knell to this this awful word, it's been bandied on for far too long, it's been perhaps the single most controversial issue that has been debated by this authority along with some other mediocre issues and no one here would not admit er to the fact that it has been opposed on such massive scale and even today we've had a further petition of three hundred and ninety five people opposing er this this this dreadful merger decision that was hanging over the er the the two centres and I'm pleased that er this this er amendment, this er er erm this petition was brought forward today because it does indicate the continuing support and opposition to er the the kind of things that we should be doing and and those that we shouldn't. Can I also say Chairman that there is now a possibility of implementing a semblance of a federated provision er which will take into account and recognise the very important needs of that particular area. Importantly as it's highlighted in the petition. The much valued community education services offered by the multi-cultural family orientated Highfields youth and community centre and the kind of development of services that could take place at the Moat, Moat centre. Now, we hear time and time again of the one million capital that was spent and yes and I do hope that the provisions that will now be made through a combined budget which Mr seems to think is half a million but I can assure you it is not half a million however, I do I can further reassure him that by the time the Highfields er and Moat management committee have gone through with this it will be half a million, there will be a proper budget provision as it should have been in the last five to six years. Unfortunately that hasn't been the case. Chairman, er I don't want to prolong the debate because as I've mentioned before there is indicated support from a number of people er but I'm grateful er to the Liberals in the fact that they feel that they are in a position to support this amendment. Much more importantly, not only does it preserve the integrity of the people of Highfields but I guess in many ways it preserves the integrity of both the parties concerned while moving and supporting this particular amendment. Can I say finally Chairman, that I will be instigating a er a request er I shall be requesting I should say perhaps to the director of education that erm the three party spokesman on the management committee and all those officers who will be involved in implementing this decision will get together at the earliest and I'm citing possibly next week so that we can be on our way to plan the next step forward to a concrete implementation of this particular proposal. That's how serious we are and although Mr er has to give his little laugh but I hope that he is just as much serious er particularly now that the political realities are that we will have a way forward, of not only supporting the delivery and management of community education services in that particular area but a clear focus has now been given, hopefully after this amendment er has been carried to the education authority. Thank you Chairman. Have we a seconder? Right Mr Chairman, I've listened with erm interest to Professor erm weasel words explaining that he didn't mean what he's been saying for the past three years and trying to explain away what he's effectively and he might as well admit it a complete volte face worse than that his agreement to an arrangement which he knows is second best. I also listened to Mr I didn't understand what he was saying but I did listen to him er the bit that I did er catch was his denial that erm the revenue budget for Moat and Highfields was half a million well he's quite correct because I've got the figures here. They're in fact five hundred and one thousand, one hundred and thirteen and if Mr is erred by one thousand one hundred and thirteen pounds I would hope he'd forgive him, the fact is that this year's budget for those two buildings er, is that amount. Er, er Mr might have added that er the village hall management committees which er he has a great affection would not be unhappy if they had the sum of five hundred and one thousand one hundred and thirteen pounds with which to provide sources, er resources for the communities that he represents. Chairman er in his remarks a bit earlier on Professor said that he did not think it was appropriate to give executive power to the director of education I wrote your words down at the time he did not think it appropriate to give executive power to the director of education and he said, despite Mr 's clarification you want to move a bit nearer if you're going to be his minder Mr that in fact he didn't that Liberals are incapable of sustaining er the same argument in committee, er sub-committee, main committee and council and I have to say er that erm er placing a bet with Ernie was taking money off children. And I'm I'm I I'm I'm delighted er I shall be encouraging them to pay up promptly. Now I do ask myself this this question erm I can recognise the argument that if you if you're not actually going to achieve your objectives you have to change your mind. I'm surprised that comes from er er Professor and his party who have for example campaigned for years for proportional representation, they know they're not gonna get it but are they gonna change their mind? Precisely either Professor and his party believe in the that certain courses of action are right, that they espouse certain policies or they become hopeless opportunists. Now we on these benches have suspected that in fact the Liberals are hopeless opportunists for a number of years. Leave that to John Major Er what I need er er and is helpful er, it would be helpful if Professor could give some confirmation of this. Because it's quite clear from hereafter there is a moral to be learned for this saga. All you need to do is to be sufficiently obstructive for a sufficiently long time and and his mates will turn around and throw up their hands and shak and and turn somersaults. Now er I have to warn him there are that sort of conduct has been indulged in to the detriment of the people of Highfields over a significant period by the Labour party. I have to warn Professor that there's more than one party can play that game and if he thinks that it is sensible to run the affairs of this council on deliberate obstructionism on the basis that if you go on long enough you can wear people down then I think it's unfortunate, it's bad for this council bad for the people we serve, it does frankly nothing for local government and I can't blame central government if it loses patience So I recognise at the end of the day that erm Mr has had troubles with some of his erm er newcomers he obviously needs to re-establish some control over his group. I could recognise. I can I can rec I can recognise when when the and tail are are wagging the dog. Ooh, ooh, hiss He needs to get his act together because if this continues then it will be Moat today and it'll be other issues tomorrow and frankly the business of this council will grind to a halt. I think to support this motion is desperately unfortunate for a number of reasons. Thank you Bob, you certainly, you certainly get us some fresh speakers in and Mr . I think that to support this motion would be extremely unfortunate and would lead to potential disaster, not for the county council but indeed for the Highfields community. I'm not surprised that Mr is happy to propose it because in fact it actually means that the status quo will in fact be cemented that that the situation that we've been faced with will in fact be enshrined and supported by the council and and the Labour party have been consistently advocating that really a and they will get their way if this motion is passed. I have to say that I hope Mr in fact didn't actually write the words of the motion it looks to me and those members of the education committee will know what I mean like another version of the Docklands back garden fudge. When somebody tried to fudge an iss tried to correct that embarrassment by totalling fuddi fudging an issue. Because what will happen if this motion is implemented. There will be a budgetary meeting of the county council, the education committee will sort out its youth and community budget and it will decide just how much it wishes t to to put to the combined centres. The management committee will meet and it will divide the money into two and give each one however much the management committee feels that it should have and that management committee need not meet again for twelve months because there will be nothing for it to do. The two issues, the two places will be operated separately. If any party on the management committee doesn't like the split it will five member it back through the whole structure to this county council and we shall have proceeded no further. Instead of having a working arrangement it is, will in fact be a total administrative disaster. I suspect that if I had to find an alternative to what we've already proposed and what we've constantly supported, I would actually go right back to the, I would actually go right back to the beginning erm because it would be cleaner and it would be clearer. There is no way in which any of us can, can advocate responsibility for the decision. There is no way that any party, there is no way that the Liberal party can say to the Labour party or to anyone else, well we'll support you, we think you're getting in a mess but it's your problem, you can carry it because that roughly is what they actually said and if it does go wrong, as it is sure that it will I am quite sure that it will be quite wrong to blame the Labour party entirely for that process, because it won't be entirely their fault. I therefore have no hesitation whatever in opposing this this total and absolute fudge. There are two members I think have spoken from the Liberal benches concerning funding bureaucracy and I would agree entirely with what that means but they've also mentioned in the same bet, budgetary control and if you're going to control budgets, you have to have a minimal amount of bureaucracy and the function really of the head of the er of the project, er the head of the the post that's now slipped into oblivion with this motion, would actually have been to do two things it would have been to hold the two groups together and it would have been to have overall control of that budget and it wouldn't have been easy and I wouldn't have like the job and I wouldn't've applied for it and certainly would have been very difficult indeed. But this really was the only way forward that I can see. So there Chairman, all I can do is deplore the situation that we've look like arriving at, I think it's the worst of all possible worlds. N Chairman. It ill behoves the party of the famous poll tax U-turn to lecture the Democrats on consistency. Here, here Erm, anyway that goes without saying I think. Chair, I I think what needs to be said in this debate is something positive about the work that has come out of particularly Highfields, er and indeed to some extent Moat, in the past. There's a lot of extremely good youth and community work has come out of Highfields youth and community centre in the past. Here, here. We have had committed staff we've had committed voluntary workers there and there's an awful lot of good practice which can still be upon, within that centre. To do that you're going to need the good will of the workers within the centre, the local community, the workers within Moat and the different factions within Moat and the one thing that the Tory line did was to unite all those factions against what the county council wanted. No matter what Bob says or Harry or any other member of the Conservative group, and I accept that they've always been consistent on it the same as the Labour group has always been consistently against the merger I accept that they've been consistently in favour of a total merger. But politics is the art of achievable and what the Tories wanted was not achievable on the ground. Indeed it could have led to great problems. I was annoyed really to hear Harry speak and I I don't normally get annoyed with my friend Harry from Loughborough er, but I was annoyed to hear him talk of disaster if there is any disaster involved in this we are averting disaster today and this is a significant decision of the county council to move forward. All the other decisions that were taken were bound to be opposed by the local community, the local youth and community staff and so on. It was known at the time that there was going to be opposition to them and it was an absolute recipe for debate after debate, council meeting after council meeting, committee meeting after committee meeting. Those of us who sat on the urban policies committee for a number of years seeing Moat devour and all the stoppages and problems there, knew that you were taking the wrong line. The officers never recommended to us that we should have a lock stock and barrel merger. The officers recommended federation and something similar to federation is what is on the table now. What I would say is this three things. One,the director of education has now got, and his staff, have now got to accept that they are no barriers to prevent moving forward on a linked, a form of linked centres. The second point is that the staff and the community, with the support of the Labour group and now the Democrats, have finally got a compromise solution which may not give them everything but again gives them what is achievable within the political complexion of this council and they must now accept that there is an onus upon them to make it work and thirdly we have got to make sure that the staffing arrangements that are referred to in here and I quote there there'd be posts for each centre who will be expected to add each with staff teams to coordinate the delivery of services by the two centres. There has got to be a willingness on the part of all the groups on this council and the officers of the various connected departments of this council to make sure that those teams are given the utmost support in delivering the youth and community service that the Highfields area needs and deserves. The framework is there we, I think, know what the decision is going to be today. Let's not chance that decision, let's all move forward together and cooperate and make it work. Let's not have sniping from the Tory benches once we've taken this decision. It has the sup the general support. Maybe the grudging support of part of the community. But it can work and it will work with our support. There's a lot of good practice to build upon in Highfields. Now we must do it. Mr Thank you very much Mr Chairman. I think erm Mr was indulging in er very interesting political rhetoric during his speech. Here, here I'd be very interested to know er in terms of U turns which I'll come back to, how he's going to deal with the next item on the agenda er, whereby the Liberal Democrats have been consistent about their policy in general with a lot of obstruction and being caused problems and how Mr will agree in this chamber to actually close some people's homes, old people's homes Thank you friends, we all know him as the one million pound councillor. He's cost us, cost us a million pounds in the first year he was a councillor. Now with regard to this particular thing, er this particular motion. You have to come to a conclusion and Professor er described how we've had to come to a conclusion. The the options seem to me, as Mr Mr said that the thing had got so convoluted and confused that the simple option seemed to be close it all down and I I would imagine that groups, other than ourselves who've had people like me in the group who've said why are this thing coming up again, let's close it down and have done with it. That is the easy option, that's the option of people who've got nothing between the ears. People who have intelligence and a conscience wrestle with these problems and we've come to a conclusion which is as good a deal as we think we can get, with the people of the area and with the Labour party and I think he said that if people in this authority are sufficiently obstructive for a sufficiently long time then people will change their minds. But there's another side to that. If people are obstructive long enough you listen and you think well, why are these people being obstructive. Are they, are they have they, are they stupid, have they gone totally mad and they're obstructing this thing for ever and ever and ever just for the sake of obstructing and you have t to listen to what they say on on this, the argument that we're having here and have had here and the argument that we've had about old people's homes, they've been two running sores in this authority and hopefully today in both of them we'll be making progress and I think I'd like to. Here, here Thank you and I think I'd like to just point out to Mr . He's always fore he's forever contrasting er these these er centres in Highfields with his village halls and er small village halls and that and that's very, the very truth, I'd like to refer him and he knows as well as I do that what he should really be comparing with are the youth and community provision across the county which is an enormous amount in excess of the amount we put into old people's homes and as Mr so rightly said, they're problems were gonna have to grapple with in the future and so you then look at what has been suggested, what has been proposed and the point that Professor made about the Labour party having to make it work, is because it is they and everybody knows it's they have been five membering this thing all the way through. Now, now they are putting their name to to some positive action. Now we we and the Conservatives in in the past have been in favour of a decision and a positive action and we would have seen it through. It's only the Labour party who's obstructed it so now they're putting their name to this, they're the ones who've changed, they're putting their name to something different and therefore they're gonna have to live with it and if you look at it what have we got? What we've got is two centres working together with a member management sub-committee they've retained the power to determine future management and staffi and staffing arrangements based on the principles set out below. So if that management committee decides in a year's time or two year's time thank you when when we've been rolling on a bit and a lot of this has died down that they want a single headed project. We will go ahead and do it and local people will own the problem and own the project and if they want to continue to have two separate administrations it would show in the budget and I don't think Mr 's right. I don't think that management committee will meet, divide the money in two and then race off and never meet for another year. I think they will manage these project together and over time they will come together and they will work together. Thank you. Mr Thank you Chairman. I would like to support the amendment and I would like to speak especially now the crocodile tears from the Tory party concern for the Highfield. Four speakers from the Tory party mentioned the damage will be for the Highfield area. How many times shall I stand up and lecture them about Highfield, I don't know. I have been here for more than two years I have lectured them. I have told them time and time again and the people have endorsed them and endorsed in voting pattern by giving me eighty nine percent of the vote. Last April. How many times shall I remind them that. How many times I just don't understand. On the amendment side I am reluctant it does infringe on a local democracy but I agree with the Liberal Democrats, it's a way forward and it's a responsibility of all of us I I agree with Roger when he mentioned that Professor mentioned that this is the Labour party like usually always mentioned it is your budget when the budget is approved it is the whole county council budget every member should be responsible for it. Not just one party or central party or the third party. How many of you know what transpired yesterday this time outside Moat Centre. How many of you know that? There was a woman who was assaulted,the Turks from the restaurant came down and beat a single man outside the Moat Centre. For Mr when he mentioned two security staff, they were er bystanders, they didn't do nothing whatsoever. Yes,we should sack him. We should all of us be responsible for that building, not just myself or yourself. Everyone should demand if the security guards are not functioning their duty we should not let them go by so Who insisted what? What. Don't get into arguments, carry on with your speech. Unfortunately this is the way the Tory always play their ploys on Highfield, they always think they are the champions of Highfield issue unfortunately they do not know what transpired in that area, they do not know the deprivation in that area. Mark market might think a backlash they, they'd better look for himself to remind himself there's no backlash in Highfield. If you support the amendment it is a way forward for all of us and I support the amendment. Thank you Chairman. Mr Thank you Chair. Can I first of all thank er Mr for his er his concern about my having to er deal with new young members. Could I in return could I Could I in return commiserate with him for not having any new members? beg to differ Because,because I I do feel sorry, I I sorry I consider it for not having any young new members. But I do feel I do feel that er he will be, he will be assisted by having close people to clarify his thoughts for the council members. Now erm if he had any as somebody says, well no I think he has some thought er simply Might not be the correct ones. Simply confused. Erm, I think the charge that has been laid against myself personally and my myself and my colleagues is the charge of vacillation and changing our mind and I and I am grateful to c my colleague David for reminding us that we have in this county had two years two years when the Labour party and the Conservative party have been hand in glove, absolutely determined that the way forward in relation to homes, elderly persons homes, not that's not to close any and now we've had a complete volte face when they've changed their minds and they've come along with us. How interesting. Mr has also asked me whether it is true that if I can't get what I want second best will do. I think the argument should be put slightly differently. Would you prefer to have nothing rather than something? Because for two years for two years the intentions of the Conservative group, which have been the intentions of ourselves have delivered on the Moat Highfield questions, delivered nothing. That is the reality of what er Mike said and I'm sorry he pinched my line politics is the art of the possible and that is a message I'm afraid that the Conservatives on this council have never adopted. time and time again they sit on the sidelines saying this is what we think don't talk to us about it don't debate it, don't ask us to think about it, take it or leave it, if you don't give us what we want we'll sit back and moan and sulk and they've played, I think that's a very irresponsible line they've played in the five years I've been on this council and I hope that er again the issue on the next item on the agenda represents a change of heart on their behalf. of course goes on about what he always goes on about and er I would remind him that the supplementary estimates which is in the amendment here, is also in the amended motion which is proposed by the Conservatives and had all party support on every committee that it's come to. Finally I I would say that to erm Mike I think the amendment that is now before us which we are supporting goes considerably further than the original federative option. And has a combined budget which is in my view, the important thing that I believe was necessary in the life of the economic circumstances . That combined budget will inevitably involve a redistribution of resources you are going to live up to what you are now putting your name to. I don't think that Mr remarks were helpful. Because I don't think the question of what's going on outside Moat Centre today or yesterday or the day after, has a lot to do with the actual alternatives that we've been . What it does have a lot to do with is that the Moat Centre has not had clear significant management on the ground and what we're proposing here today should produce that in the very near future and what the proposals that Mr proposals would have done is not produced that in the significant future and I think that's the point that really needs to be stressed. Thank you. Mr It's not my day really earlier today I had to admit to being grateful to John Gummer now I'm gonna have to be. I know it's terrible isn't it I never thought I'd say that. Now I'm gonna have to say I'm gonna be grateful to Mr it's a really bad day. No I am grateful to Mr because he's finally crystallised in my mind something that's been bugging me the longer I stay on this council about exactly what the Tories see their role here as and it's now very clear to me, more than ever and that is that if you want to be obstructive and negative and if you go on long enough being obstructive and negative what you can end up doing is that you'll find yourself eventually in a position going on long enough that you can make totally meaningless speeches but at least you'll get nice headlines in the paper and that seems to me the whole essence of the Tory strategy. When my colleague to my right here, Roger and myself put forward a motion at last council on this issue ably led by our glorious leader to my left I would like to say that we've set up. Now what I would like to say is that we've made clear that we're with certain very clear objectives in pushing forward, in saying that certain things had to be achieved and when I read the lilac piece of paper or whatever colour we want to call it. I see a set of conclusions that achieve almost everything that was demanded at that time and I am grateful to everybody concerned who's actually sat down and actually really thought about what we're trying to do and everybody has made some compromise here and I shall certainly support this amendment and I shall make the compromise because the one thing in here that I thought was necessary that isn't there is the statement that there will be a head of centre and having actually worked in a project, head of sorry, head of project and having actually worked in a situation where I was a joint manager erm in the long run I think people will see the the wisdom of of a single head of project. But that's up fo that's up to people experience t t t t to conclude. But the main there 'ere is, we haven't actually changed our position we have actually stated clearly that we wanted to achieve something, we wanted to make sure that what was being provided in that community was the best best thing possible within the resources available and that things developed on This amendment takes us that way forward and we are at least being clear to our principles rather than just being negatively obstructive. Mr Thanks Chair. I just like to start off by saying and just reminding the council well in particular Mr in light of what he said that he doesn't understand what Mr is on about, well he's never understood the issue of the merger in Highfields. Mr has made more publicity on this issue than any other councillor. I think there's no issue in his patch that he might want to talk about. But he's made national headlines local and every other headlines that comes about regarding this issue of the merger. But I think in seconding this motion I think it's a way forward and I think it's better late than never I think what it talks about that we would not be here today Mr Chairman if this would have been agreed by what was put by the officers two and half years ago. It's not a federated system, it actually, positively talks about moving forward as Professor states it in the economical situation the council is in. It talks about one budget covering for the two centres and it also talks about two heads of centres which is more practicable and more rational than any other s situation that would have been if the merger decision would have stayed. There has never been an argument put by anyone to convince myself or people who have protested against the merger, a rational argument has never been put against what people have said that the merger is a rational way forward. I think it would have been a disaster and a recipe for disaster because practically if you know what the situation is in the Moat Centre and the Highfields youth and community centre then people would have never resisted to that change. I'm not saying that people would have never changed their ideas but if it would have been done in the manner that it would have been done in in the first place and if people would have been told about their future lives and if people had been, would've accepted what was going on in light of all the decisions that have been taken previously regarding the merger issue. I think these proposals not only are a way forward but also in light of what is actually happening in the area of Highfields with er the high numbers of unemployment, with the high rate of people underachieving in education I think for the last two and a half years there has been no clear guidelines or structure that has systematically brought about any results in the two centres to move forward where people have lost out by this issue being bureaucratic and a political football that's being kicked about and I think it's about time where we now have cross party consensus that we move positively forward and work towards these proposals. I mean in so I I come here today with a petition that I presented that also talks about proposing to abolish the merger, I mean this is a move just one step away from that but I still feel in what was proposed at the last full council meeting and I would express my views to the officers that in light of what has been suggested today is actually implemented to the wording as it stands because the joint working party that had been er written up previously never did meet although if I can inform it was only the officers who actually met up and I hope that in light of all the working group and the two heads of centres covering for each other would be implicitly applied. In light of er Near time all the consultation that also talks about in this paper is met with the two centres, the management committee of Highfields youth and commune centre and also the users of the Moat Centre and I think in light of everything that's gone on I think it's substantially a success to stand here and say that we have at least achieved some result and I I formally would welcome the Libs supporting this this afternoon and I'm grateful for the turn that the Libs have made and in light of er what er Mr the involvement Mr has put in. Time time time now please. Thank you. Thanks Chair. Mr do you wish the right of reply. No it's Mr Mr Not really Chair . I'm mean we've discussed it often but I I would be grateful if we could It's Mr I'd hate to stop Mr in full cry Okay then chairman I I would er recommend that we support the amendment moved by Mr . Right, those in favour. Right erm yeah look at the congress. Just wanna wrap this up now erm by bringing in the erm example of Greece. Er the er er Greek revolt. Erm just to recap on that slightly. It started round about eighteen twenty one although actually there there'd been erm er simmering discontent in the amongst the Christians in the Balkan area for some time. We we needn't worry too much that thought but erm the Greek revolt itself in eighteen twenty to one to round about eighteen twenty five had gone on without any European intervention. To some extent this was due to the influence of the er of of . Erm who was able to hold er the Russians back from intervening on the grounds that it would be er seen as intervention in a er in in in a revolt. Erm the revolt is of course essentially a nationalist revolt. I suppose there are liberal overtones in it but it's essentially a nationalist revolt. After eighteen twenty five of course erm the death of Alexandria especially of Nicholas Russia is more inclined to intervene especially as the Greek rebels are being defeated because of the mention the intervention of of erm Turkey's ally erm er Egypt Egypt a a a a problem for the Turkish empire . The ruler of Egypt Mohammed Ali intervened in the revolt on behalf of Turkey with the promise of territory in the area. Erm and the revolt begins to er er er crumble. Erm so Russia decides to intervene and at this point erm is especially concern of Britain. And the upshot is that in eighteen twenty six Britain suggests in essence holding a congress to discuss the er er Greek revolt. Erm Britain and France are very concerned about the prospect of Russian intervention. Erm And in essence a kind of congress is held at St Petersburg. It's not trotted out in the old history books as one of the conferences, or one of the congresses rather. In fact it's, it's more often referred to correctly as a conference. Erm it consisted of the ambassadors of the great, of the, of of the great powers erm er meeting together at St Petersburg. Erm it's there's a certain irony about all this. As we know erm Canning had to a great extent welcomed the end of the congress system. His famous comment about things are back to as they should be every nation for herself and god for us all. Erm but in twenty six he in a sense does a U turn. And he's concerned to get great power co-operation to solve the Greek er er problem. The other irony is of course that up until at the previous congresses like Verona erm Britain hadn't attended. At this one Austria doesn't attend. And same, well and and Prussia as well for that matter but they're not so, so important. At this conference the great powers involved are Britain, Russia and France. Of course the other irony as well is that the powers that meet at the conference at St Petersburg er the powers decide they will intervene in Greece. And they're intervening of course here on the side of a revolt which is going against the grain of erm of certainly for Russia of course of er of of the attitudes of the eighteen erm er eighteen teens early eighteen twenties. The idea was basically to produce some kind of semi-independent Greece. Er of course as we know or we might, some of us might know from er Brit. his. that erm from British History that erm in eighteen er erm the Turks refused to co-operate in this. And erm in when was it eighteen twenty seven at the Battle of Navareno the British navy sunk the Turkish fleet. Erm thus to a great extent erm ending the erm er the prospects of Turkish success. What what was that battle again? Navareno. Navar Avokea or Navareno Bay erm it's more, I think it's more technically known as Avokea See if they've got a reference to the . Oops. Oh no it is Nav I'm I'm sorry. I'm confused aren't I? It is Navareno. Yeah erm again you needn't worry too much about the er erm about the ramifications of this Kenning died in twenty seven and Britain to some extent disentangled herself from the Greek revolt but the upshot was that in eighteen thirty Greece became an independent state. Her independence guaranteed by Britain, Russia and France. Okay erm I suppose we ought to mention in this context as well er Belgium. I'll probably refer to it again later on . Er in Belgium of course in eighteen thirty erm a nationalist revolt broke out in response really to the French revolution of that year. Which we'll be looking at briefly in a sec. Erm this was a direct challenge to the Vienna settlement of course. As we know at the Vienna settlement, Belgium was put under er er er er essentially under Dutch rule. Erm Britain and France were prepared to defend Belgian independence. The other powers were er at odds with Britain and France ie Austria, Russia Prussia. So again we see a split in the er in in in amongst the great powers. What? I just It's Britain and France were prepared to support Belgian independence. Erm Russia, Prussia Austria not. And we are seeing in eighteen thirty a significant gap between on the one hand erm the western powers and on the other hand the east european or the central and eastern european powers. In eighteen thirty of course, the east european powers were unable erm er to intervene. Er Russia had erm a revolt in Poland to face. Austria faced disturbances in Italy. Prussia of course couldn't really act by herself. But we are seeing a widening gap. And indeed erm in the eighteen thirties we see the formation in the west of the so called quadruple alliance not to be confused with the great quadruple alliance of eighteen er thirteen. The quadruple alliance consisted of Britain, France, Spain and Portugal which had by now got sort of liberal constitutional governments. Well it's erm it's erm it's about, I think it's about eighteen thirty three thirty four. Doesn't really matter. It's the earliest, er early eighteen thirties. And on the other hand, Austria, Russia and er Prussia it's Munchengratz isn't it. forgetting me er me Munchen Yep. In fact they may even have a date for you here. Yeah eighteen thirty three Munchengratz. It's an agreement to defend each other against the threat of revolution. Yep. Erm So we are seeing by er the early eighteen thirties something of a formalized split between the er er the powers of er the quadruple and then the er quintsimple erm er alliance. I'm referring obviously to the quadruple alliance of eighteen er er fifteen. Okay perhaps we can er er wrap a few things up on the erm on the er Vienna er settlement and the congress system itself. What actually happened in Belgium? Belgium became independent. Sorry yeah. Belgium became independent. Erm it's ind , it's independence was recognized fully by all the major European powers by eighteen thirty nine. It was regarded as erm it was one of Palmerston's, one of Palmerston's great triumphs wasn't it? Isn't it the case that Palmerston when he was on his death bed had the clause to the Belgian treaty read to him to cheer him up. Okay erm let's perhaps make a few comments then about the Vienna settlement itself. The old er the old kind of chestnut question is was it a success or a failure? I I I'd say with the, with the revamped exam you're not likely, you're not likely to get a question like that. Was Vienna successful? But you're gonna get a much wider question if it comes up on this and erm perhaps in incorporating the congress system but let's approach it from that, that perspective anyway. I think the best way of looking at this is to kind of take an open-ended version of what the Vienna settlement is all about. Er not just the treaty in eighteen fifteen but the whole congress system erm after eighteen fifteen onwards and into the eighteen twenties and such like. Erm I suppose the er the classic interpretation of the er the Vienna settlements is that erm in in the nineteenth century was that it was a failure and there was a, there was a kind of er consensus beginning quite early actually. There's a kind of consensus view that in the language of ten sixty six and all that the Vienna settlement was a bad thing. Erm and I say this view is, is in some respects being er erm er expressed relatively early on. Erm and you even get it associated with leading rulers or states er statesmen of the day. For instance erm somebody like Napoleon the Third. He emerged as president of France as Prince Louis Napoleon in eighteen forty eight and he er he erm achieves power by coup d'etat and becomes emperor in eighteen fifty two. Napoleon the Third is someone who's er who sees it as one of his objectives to undo the Vienna settlement. Erm and you've got other leading figures of the day. Count Cavor prime minister of Piedmont in eighteen er fifty. Erm and someone who's described as perhaps one of the architects of Italian unity. He becomes the prime minister of of a relatively united Italy erm in eighteen er eighteen sixty. Cavor is someone who's er Right. Cavor is someone who's hostile er to the Vienna settlement. Let alone of course large numbers of liberal stroke nationalist erm revolutionaries within Europe in the eighteen er twenties, thirties and forties. The various national secret societies and various nationalist movements like er Young Italy and there's even one called Young Europe which is kind of a pretty, pretty much catch-all one. But the various nationalist societies or the revolutionary purpose. They're all hostile to the Vienna settlement. And that perhaps er having mentioned the nationalist erm societies this perhaps gives us a clue to it. The the view was taken that the Vienna settlement was hostile to liberalism and nationalism. That was the view taken that the Vienna settlement was hostile to liberalism. It was hostile to nationalism. And therefore it was wrong because the argument goes that liberalism and nationalism are the great triumphant er ideologies of the nineteenth century and the Vienna settlement's not only wrong, but it was historically erm in a sense doomed because it was trying to oppose the growing erm unstoppable er ideologies of er erm of er of Europe. By the way erm it's always rather amusing when you see in the old history books the er the idea that erm that, to give an example, somebody like Metternich. You get the old idea that Metternich ignored liberalism and nationalism. Erm that's a very, a very misleading way of putting it. Metternich in many ways thought of little else except liberalism and nationalism. The Vienna settlement didn't ignore liberalism and nationalism. It tried its best to clobber it. It tried its best to actually er suppress it. And don't forget erm perhaps we ought to say a word on the er on the conservative's side here. Erm don't forget it's people like Metternich and indeed Castlereagh and the other erm er figures at the Vienna settlement. They were looking back in eighteen fifteen at twenty odd years of war and revolution. And if that was you know you could, I supp , you could argue that the French revolution had been built on notions of liberalism and it had encouraged nationalism in Europe. And therefore you could associate liberalism and nationalism with war, terror erm and perhaps therefore it wasn't all that desirable. Obviously as well in Metternich's er er, in Metternich's case nationalism would be the end of the Austrian empire. Because the Austrian empire, the Habsburg empire was a conglomeration of large numbers of there look, if I can get that out I'll be able to see if I can get that out love I no I can't, no not there Let's have it then No, no you can't love, because We've done it at work Go on then that is the same thickness as that in there, that is What's that there then? That's what that, that's come off there that has Well you pull it out don't you? Go on then you try and pull it out of us, that's what I'm trying to do look you want a pair of pliers do you?

Yeah But erm, you know, get it's got to be scrubbed more often so you know Normally that is the same thickness as what this I think can you hold that dear?

Come on physio wasting more time oh I don't wanna move the blue ball, but, if, if I was to play it like that it would be an obvious crush the ball into the mallet. Yes , yes. I mean, there again, you're seeing these players doing it, when you say , oh what , and you know they don't call somebody over to have a look at . Don't have to say Yes, yes. would you like to come and putt the shot Right, right. Erm, you can usually tell by the . No. It's only the one . Indeed, indeed, yes. That's why I told you the difference, you can't really Yes. Shall I put my clip on there? Yes you should. Right. Assume I'm not here. Yes. Right. Yep. Right. Presumably kicking the opponent's ball, it's, it's not acceptable. , it's not a fault, the only time it's a fault is when you're erm, I don't know the words really, when you're actually in play, so if you were to take a, if you were actually doing this Is that right? Yes. then, that's a fault. Oh, yes . It's actually taken. I understand, yes. Yes. , I'm still in play as it were, and I do that then it's . Right, right, I see. But it's not a fault if you, erm, sort of walk up to that ball and erm, do this, it's not a fault. No, I see. O K? Yes, good, O K. What you really want to do is to get together through to there don't you? Yes. Or there, so you can rush,across to there. Fine Oh twit, Put it back where it was and then . Yes, quite, quite, out, I think I thought it was going to shudder against the post and the hoop and Yes. Lovely, great . Right, yep. Putting the red, thank you, erm somewhere here. That's it, isn't it . Yes, right, right, yep. You've got to get Yes. cos the red goes straight line always, doesn't matter whether you hit it like that, that, that, that, that red ball will always It'll move away on all through the line of contact, right. O K? Yes. The one that does take reflection , but I think you've got to aim really for that wire. Yes, yes, good. That's the trouble having got this far I mean, you having stood there, I was deliberately aiming to, to strike that one. , got straight through it. Going straight through anyway, right, fine. I'm not capable of these weeny deflections anyway, so I don't know why the heck I'm bothering. Always try to be behind the other ball when you come through the hoop, because you're going that way, you see? Yes. Erm, but erm, what I really wanted to do was to cover about . Oh , oh sorry, it's it's the next one we're aiming at, the one we're aiming at isn't it yes. Yes, so to cut red,down, near that black ball is, lovely. Yes. There is a danger of red ball, you have a cut . Right, O K. Hit it on the right,. Yep. Right. To the right, yes. To to the right? Yellow ball . Of course I'm sorry, for some strange reason I thought we were going that way, I've got to go through the other way haven't I? It, it's always from the out outside in, yes? Well, except for on the way back. Ah. Right. You've got to really get to the right of that red, so can rush it down to the, left of that hoop with the red paint on it. Right, so Erm, what, the nice shot is to get back up to, there and get over to the yellow. I don't know whether you're going to do it. Right, so black down there, yellow over there, O K. . show you, then you Yes please. . I'm going to get the line in two balls where the black .. Yes. Then eh,on the ball's . Yes. Yes, yes. I've got to get up to that next . I put the yellow up onto hoop three,Gone the wrong side. . Yellow's nice, yeah, ah. I don't think I'll have a chance . Yes. Can you change your own ball during a go? Right. Right, right. I think you've got to move the yellow near one of my hoops. Right. Now that's your next hoop isn't it? Yes. I am, I am indeed, yes, yes, I I've got to deal with it some way, somehow. Move yellow onto red. Yes, yes, O K. What would've happened if the red ball had gone through? Nothing. Nothing. If it had been your hoop, it would've count. , yes, yes, you you would of . Yep, good. The ball, I've got a ball near my next two anyway Mm mm. and I've got to , another out of, in play, which is always useful. Right . Right. Presumably when you do land in a position like that even though as you say you're getting near the end of the game for the blue ball, you wouldn't deliberately not go through the hoop, if you'll put in that, if you put yourself in that position? You,, no, you you'd of played away. Yes. Right, right. Now, I've really got to start thinking about where I want the ball to be. Mm. When a , it would be nice to have yellow, that yellow's fairly near the hoop Yes. so if I can get that. Yes. Mm. Shall I go and get the tea? Oh excellent. Thank you very much. Yes! Yes! Yes! I think my, my head is actually somewhat Dave . Well, which which shot comes, in, after which shot and so on and so forth, I mean it's It's a Roman Catholic Church . Oh right. Yes, yes and, and there's no need to be going through a hoop, at any time, if you continuation constantly, you, you Well, you've normally got to go through. You can't let the yellow ball . Ah right, right, yes. You can see how . Yes, yes. Right. There should be if we were, they should be . Taking that all the way round. Yes, yes, yes. I see what you mean but a tactical game, my goodness, it's a Oh yes . Done it in a match,, games, if I was playing against you, I would . Yes. Fairly Yes. how well you play. Yes. That's why I can start to take reasonable risks hitting in . Right. . This obviously psychological . Think in many cases break down,break down in . Quite. Yes, who who is the arbiter? Erm . Oh really, yes, yes. So,, not . Yes, it's tricky . So now what they've done is playing a match . Depending on how many games . I see. Yeah I think . Yes. Professional game. Yes, yes, I seem yes. Yes. . Purpose of the game. Yes, yes. And . , I said, she said but I expect him to . Silly isn't it? Very silly. I didn't take any notice of them after that. No. No, no, no tut. in fact they make me aggravated.. No quite, quite, yeah. Yes, just enjoy the game and company, yes I . Oh, Vincent's one, eh Roger's probably about the next best man,better of the two of us that's why. That's what gets you Yes. more than anything. And you take part in most of these competitions? It's the best thing of course so It's a very weird thing to be doing really isn't it? You can leave it there if you want even though it's the ladies Yeah. Thank you club house just to the left. Right. There's certainly a fancy er club house there isn't it? What's what's this fancy building here David? Squash. Oh! Is it? Right. Aha. why we can't get on there, on the door Yes fine. Yes there's quite a lay out in the main building. Right Croquet and squash. Bowls down the side Oh yes. It used to be about the best bowling green in the in this part of the country. Did it really? Yes. Only the one tennis court? No there's one there there's one here. Oh yes. Over there that's behind me that's Oh yes, yes. I am not sure whether it's those certainly where you can see the right players . Eileen's husband is the leading light in the bowls. Oh is he? Really? And is that ah er another cricket team altogether or what? Club altogether? That's another club. Yes. This is the club Right. Yes. I think he he had a heart attack recently. I think he is off of it now but I think he must be quite a leading light Yes yes. speak to David . Oh was he? Yes. Oh! Oh! Yes yes indeed now, now I'm there and there aren't I? Now if you were using this this is what we would do. It's probably erm, yeah I think you'd probably have a shot at your yellow. Doesn't matter if you go off because you could come up behind it Mmm mmm and it once Yes yes. Fine. Right. I could actually feel that in in my wrists yes Soon as you think you're going to tense up too much you try the swing of the mallet. Right. Right so that's Well I think what you do is push the yellow somewhere towards the peg in the middle. Probably just the right you know, run. Yes Get the yellow to the right of the peg. Fine. Doesn't matter if you don't. If you kind of drop down behind the blue if you use the blue first and the bat's up there you gotta go sort of near to it to get behind you're going to rush down to your hoop. Now you've got a much easier shot haven't you? Yes You can just push blue back over there and and, or if you are not happy about that just a little take up. Bearing in mind that a take up is always a much more accurate shot, specially for beginners. It's just a little tiny tap and you're gonna That's it get right about there aren't you? Yep. Fine. Jolly good direction, but Too jolly heavy. Very good. That's lovely Gosh! Fourth time at last No, you've got the wave right I mean you know Yes. Yes. I mean you know loads of people like this don't always get it right. Really. Yes. You want a nice little bit of lawn there. That's another thing that should be looked at because Yes. Yes you could be on a rough patch or bumpy patch whatever yes yes Weedy patch yes, yes fine. So you can rush that blue down to the one now Down beyond of the hoop ideally. Yes. That was probably I rather overdid the angle too didn't I, the cut? Yeah, I think it's about, isn't it surely? That's a I'm very lucky I don't really have problems with the angles Good. at all but it's just . Yes it's much better. Right. Try a try a shot with a which would be a roll won't it? Most most people play this er with a fairly conventional croquet stroke because the black ball's the blue ball's gonna go twice the distance of the red. Isn't it? Yes. Roughly. Yes. So really just I I always have problems, I I always tend to play it down like that, I don't know why. But most, you should really stand up and play it with fairly,play together. You can't for real you can't really move blue ball you can move the red ball as much as you like but not What you have to do is to so just try a normally conventional just sling straight through here Yeah. You're doing what I was always doing the red, the yellow, but try it again. Yeah it was the red near the yellow you mean. Yes. Ivan Ivan! Okay. You can go now. Right. Hang on a bit. Try and step it forward Right Yep. I was pushing wasn't I? If I still was going down I'd do it like that Lovely! Yes or the blue I mean the red's gone all right. But that's what we're trying to do, trying Right. Okay. play the shot like that way, but I think whatever works for you. Well that's what counts isn't it? Yes. So I'm now going straight for the black? Oh no. You can move the yellow, can't you? Oh yes. Yes I see. What I would do, because you haven't got a blue hard enough is to push yellow off somewhere to the left of black Yes? so you can only push it across to three and get near the yellow, near the black. Right. You must you must get at least a ball a pioneer ball near your next two Right. to stand a chance. Okay. Fine. So you come up behind it so that your body and the striker's ball, that being your red ball and the other ball, the object ball are always the same straight line I mean it doesn't matter whether you come in from the side you're walking up to it in a straight line put your mallet down, swing it through. Yes. Lovely. Yes it all looks so darned easy when you do it David . Yes. I don't think it would be worth playing if it's easy. No. Absolutely. Absolutely and the that's why the You can't expect to get anything out of practice unless you concentrate on it Yes. Yes. Yes. That's it. Now that was a nice hit. That's not quite Not hard enough Yes. Put the other way it was a good stroke. You can get over to over to bat. You don't need to be very near bat, do you? So you know again I tend to hit it downwards you see, but a lot of players don't even er lot of players play their rolls like that. I tend to.. you know a lot of players don't play any side shots they play all their shots like that. Do they? yes. Yes. I tend to think it's easier to play at the side, because you can actually do that if you want. Yes You can, you know I can I can get two balls to almost roll from corner to corner by doing Yes yes yes So try it like that and swing your mallet too so you won't be able to go above hoop three and Right. Right. Okay. You've got to stand forward a little bit more, haven't you? You've got to play down on to the ball. Right. Right. So bring your feet forward a little You mean further forward. Right. Lovely. Yes lovely. Very good. Now that's pretty well perfect, isn't it? Smashing yes. Yes. That's good. Yes. Yes. You can still cut back over to the to about there. No no I wanting to get You want to hit croquet plan? Yes. To to get to there. You can then do a nice little shot to get closer on the hoop with red Right. Put black over there somewhere. Right. Put your mallet on the floor. Right yes yes good point yeah just right. Right that's a nice approach should be able to get the red somewhere Yes there it is a little roll shot. Right. If you do you're gonna play it by Do you prefer this would you? Well I think you should do what you feel comfortable at most most you you there again if you saw Vincent playing, he just plays it standing up. Well yes pretty good Is it? except you've got a slight problem, haven't you? Cos you can't really get that red through without crushing it. Ah ah I really didn't understand the crushing bit, sorry. Well, if I do that, that's a crush cos my mallet's in contact whilst the ball's in contact with the hoop. Right. I'm crushing the ball against the hoop. Your problem is that you because the line of that ball is overhanging the wire Yes even if you played it like that it's still a crush. Yes Yes mallet you're play really you've got no choice but to come back. Right right. I don't know. It's a very difficult one I think in a game that probably they'd just let you do that. Aha It did sound to me like a crush, because you've really got to play away from the mallet haven't you? The the that's the the the correct procedure is it, to play away rather than a I think most people would consider I mean if you can picture the course of the ball, it's gonna do that, isn't it? Mm Your mallet is going to be is gotta be in contact with the mallet the ball whilst the ball is in contact with the wire Yes yes yes you can't No I didn't. No! I was just thinking should Join up? Should I be? Well I think you should join up because something's put in the middle but depends in a game If I was playing against a level player you might just have a very hard crack together, but just to join up gently in the middle. Right right fine. If you miss , you're still playing Yes I didn't show you this David. That's that's what it's about. The Longman Treasury of Spoken English And they're simply recording an awful lot of people in conversation. Oh yes. Erm and they will keep them in the archives and I suppose transcribe them or something of the sort. Yes interesting. Yes, yes it is rather intriguing. They just knocked at the door and said how would you care to take part? just stroke. Oh yes, and of course when you have it for two days you can't actually guard your language all the time I don't suppose they really want you to, do they? No I'm certain they don't. That's the last thing they want. Hardly ever. What never. Well hardly ever. I'm always criticizing on the B B C and I T V. About the English? Oh yes. There's certainly plenty to criticize there, isn't there? I've got a bee in my bonnet about it. Isn't it a good job we're perfect, eh? And there's the controversy, which I don't approve of controversy and they rather roll their tongues around and in and out of words and Don't you think that's one of the beauties of English though? The problem is slightly in that Formidable isn't she. Formidable. Yes formidable I agree. But word word pronunciations gets changed just by common usage don't they? Yes they do. They do indeed. Yes. Peculiar day for the first of June, isn't it? It's National Croquet Day did you remember that? National Croquet Day? Mmm. Is it? Yes. Who told you that? Er I think I learnt that when I went to the meeting of the South East Croquet Federation earlier in the year. Oh yes, when I was Yes you said David that in fact it was arranged a little late and some clubs didn't manage to fit it into their programme. Well no. Yes. We we had an open day last Sunday, or Sunday before, I forget. Yes yes fair enough but We could have held it today if we thought Right. When was it held? The open day? You you No I don't mean how Oh no. Do you mean the You said you went on the ticket Oh South East Croquet Federation Committee Meeting. Yes. That was in Steven's house I think that was The other one Caterham the other one Was that the A G M or Er no that was A G M. Where David used to live Oh really? who founded the South East Croquet Federation. Yes he moved to France. Is that David the designer? No. No. Northern France. But I can't remember the name of the Oh yes. He still is involved with croquet because you see he organizes this week at erm later in the year. Oh yes Yes, that's right yes. navigation. Who? My daughter. Oh is she? Oh yes. I'm going down in about a month's time. Italian coast . Yes. David not as far as St Tropez where Horrible aren't they those oil slicks they're dreadful. Have you always lived in this area, Evelyn? Yes,home town. Sorry which is your home town? Bournemouth. Oh lovely yes I like Bournemouth thank you so much very kind of you. Pleasure. Thanks awfully. Nice to meet you Evelyn. Thank you very much. Ah. Well you may see me again you never know I shall look forward to it. Cheerio. Funny old thing. Yes. Not a clue I don't think Really? Ah what she gets out of it I just don't know. Companionship I suppose. Yes yes. Shame. Oh well I suppose it's something isn't it? If she gets that out of it. Yes yes and it's fresh air gentle exercise, isn't it? Yes yes and it means she does get out and does see other people. Yes yes indeed. Does she tend to walk down when she goes? Oh does she? She did drive until last year but I would imagine that she's probably no longer safe driving. Sure She's had two or three accidents in . She's a goodly age, you know. Yes. Well I really enjoyed that David. Did you? Good! Yes, yes. It's a Do you want to come again?think about it Yes yes. You'll need come a good few times and give it three four six months. Yes. I think the books recommend really most players eighteen months to two years before you can come. Before you can call yourself a player? Well before you can start setting up a break. Yes. I mean that does vary enormously. When you come down from twenty to eight or nine in a season, you know Golly! I know. I mean he plays a lot of croquet. He only works three days a week anyway because of lot of tournaments Yes yes I mean he started at roughly about the same time as me. I think he's about five and a half five something like that. My goodness! Yes. He's probably even less. He's an amazing player to watch, bordering on breaking down all the time. Some of the shots he pulls off are fantastic. Really? Yes. Rather excitable that's the only problem. Yes. Comes from Barnsley. Oh yes. What is his name? Edward . Ah yes. So how do you think the Eden Park problem is going to be resolved? What we really need to do is to find some land to play on. I've almost given up on the London Borough of Bromley because the land, the areas that they've offered us have been quite impractical and although we've got, you know, croquet is a cheap sport. No clubs have very much money. I mean we've got something like five or six hundred pounds Yes. sitting doing nothing. But that doesn't go very far, does it? No. No it doesn't. I did go to Park Manor. I might go back there again. That a good idea. Because they've got the land, but I just didn't get on. What about the Bromley Cricket Club, Tennis Club, Hockey Club complex? I honestly don't know David. I genuinely do not know. I really feel in a borough as big as Bromley, which is the biggest Yes they must have somewhere where we can play, but erm perhaps I ought to trouble is that you get fobbed off you know. The Mayor, Mayoress said to me well we'll find you something but Yes So you you bandy her name about. People jump about for a bit but then having offered you Yes yep. They've done what they feel they should be doing They say well we've offered you three blocks and you've turned them all down and you say well yes but you've offered us blocks not not Not suitable for the purpose. Yes yes It's not just the erm the fact the area round you need it's also the location that's involved Yes indeed. That was part of the problem. We could have gone back to the where we started and then we only paid a couple of hundred pounds a year for the land that they used to keep the grass cut and everything but the problem was really the area. We'd never have been able to build a club up. Yes. And we we really decided that we would be much better not having all the hassle and just all joining or joining another club. Yes quite quite. It's much easier just belonging to a club and not having Yes absolutely yes absolutely. Go there when you want and play and It was very nice being there this afternoon and being able to walk straight on to the lawn. Yes yes well I think you will find that with most croquet clubs Really yes yes I think perhaps the top clubs like I don't I've never been there. They are supposed to have the best lawns in the country. Are they? Yes Very good membership. They spend a lot of money. In terms of lawns it's the biggest club in the world. Is it? Yes. They've got twelve thirteen lawns there. Gosh! They haven't got the membership. Shame. And of course the upkeep these days is quite high. Yes indeed. There's a sort of general Dulwich Sports Club ground keeping facility I assume Yes. for that ground? Yes. I think that perhaps, that croquet is a poor relation, but erm to the club itself, I don't know. But I would have thought probably the squash or the bowls strictly probably generate more money And the ground is more intensively used perhaps for that? Well that's yes. I think that that that perhaps again one of the problems with croquet. It uses up quite an area doesn't it for er mm Well is it any more than a tennis court? Well I suppose a game of tennis doesn't last as long No it doesn't. You can get several games in It is possibly no worse than the cricket Sure. area because they have twenty two players, haven't they? Yes Though they are only eleven twelve or thirteen on at any one time. Yes. Yes I mean if it is possible to provide that huge acreage I mean the space per player or whatever is rather less for croquet than for cricket, isn't it? Yes, except you need a more perfect lawn that's more perfect area Well there are there are green keepers aren't there? I know a guy who bowls at the Bromley Bowling Club in exactly and he told me that they have professional green keepers who look after lots of different greens and they come into them once a week or whatever. Do they? Well that's interesting because we were wondering who we could get to have a look at our lawns and tell what's wrong with it because they are not very good are they? No no that one we were playing on certainly wasn't the greenest and grassiest It's a problem. You will find with a lot of croquet lawns Is it? Yes yes. Well you know somewhere like Bromley Bowling Club would have a very good membership. So there's a lot of money coming in they could they could afford to have somebody like that Absolutely. looking after their lawns. Absolutely yes. And London Borough of Bromley have got a spare bowling green in I forget the name of the road but it's in the Beckenham area which unless they're doing work to any of the main bowling greens just lies fallow through the summer. Right. They obviously keep it cut and keep it up to scratch. Yes. But they were willing to let us play on it because croquet wouldn't have done any real harm. The money they wanted for us to use it even just a weekend was absolutely ridiculous which to me seems in opposition to the whole idea of the borough. Quite. The borough's providing spaces for people to enjoy themselves. Yes exactly, exactly. But the problem being now of course that I think in line with most London boroughs there is club which tennis club which has tennis courts on Local Authority land. They actually enter into a lease or tennis agreement with the London Borough Yes. for a period of five or ten years and lease it off them and then have to maintain it. And of course if you want to use somewhere like the bowling green for bowls or croquet then you've got to pay the going rate. Yes indeed yes. But I did feel that perhaps they could have bent the rules a little. Yes and there are different going rates for different things as there are with property, aren't there? I would have thought so. But I suppose as a bowling green then you but he said that we've already cut the stick their neck out will they? No no no no no. They are far too liable to have it chopped off. Or they think they are. Yes. I must admit that I got fed up with pursuing it and I think it's like banging your head against a brick wall in the end. Yes. Didn't really have the energy to pursue it. Yeah. No I don't blame you. If it did say locate to the Bickley area or something like that would you change the name? Probably. If they did locate then I could get quite a good membership Yes. Oh yes. ith croquet you know where the croquet players are and where they live. Yes. Yes. And even in quite a wide area not perhaps the garden croquet players you wouldn't know about the people who play in the back garden but you know the people who play in tournaments. Or people who belong to other clubs. Yes indeed. Yes Yes. It's odd I suppose because I mean I could be much happier to play a lot more if there was a subscription towards croquet. It didn't particularly bother me. Aha. I would think one gets a lot out membership Yes yes. This is the dress I'm thinking of taking from erm Marks. Do you think it suits me? Is it possible to wear it with a belt? Or There isn't belt How Are you having second thoughts about having it, dear? I'm not so hundred percent certain it's not one of those things that I think Right. Well I what I think Suzannah and I are both genuinely in favour. Definitely that's what I want. No. I think Suzannah and I are genuinely in favour. What would you wear as an exit? Does it need to be a high neck sort of thing? Well not necessarily it could have some loopy beads or something couldn't you? What colour? Brown blue yellow red. Any of those colours Colour coordination himself. and a boop boop boop boop to you too. What what jewellery colours can mum wear with that? With Rochester it's been let go. Mm. Mhm. Erm I mean, I've personally, I think the novel is actually a journey. Erm I think that Jane's erm journey towards independence is erm where she moving towards a position where, if you achieve a certain kind of independence, you can then choose to give it up. Mm. And that's what she does. Mm mm. It's not worth giving it up if you haven't chosen to give it up. Mm. Mhm. It's a bit like being erm you know, you know, a Christian isn't it? Free born. It's only worth it if it's personal, if you choose it. It isn't worth it if it was foisted on you, or you inherited it's got to be a personal thing. Erm so I think Jane's is a erm a spiritual journey with a psychological basis. That link between childhood and adulthood that she shows that childhood terrors can affect adult biases, opinions. Now, in this introduction of this Oh yes. this is an old er er Penguin. Yes. It, it says, almost what you're saying. Oh does it? Yes. Oh! That's nice to know. Erm yes. It says erm The theme is an urgently felt personal one, an exploration of how a woman comes to maturity in the world of the writer's youth . Er, erm, it goes on to explain, but I don't want to bother you. But, er similar similar Oh! That's thank you. It's always nice to know people agree with you isn't it? I once Oh yes. for her Mm? Mrs you know, the er wife of the famous er literary critic. Queenie Leavis. Oh yes! Que Queenie Leavis. Yes. Queenie Leavis. She wrote the foreword. Oh did she? Yes. Yes. Ah well. Yeah. Mm. Well there you are! Two minds, great minds. Yes, that's right. If you, if you look at all the men in the this book, I mean, to begin with the erm cousin, the boy when she Horrible! was a child Mm. John Rivers. was a horrible thing Yes. in this story. Yes. And the girl. And then the erm previous you know, the erm he, he was a revolting character and, Rochester, of course, she didn't stay friends with. Mm mm. Erm, and then, and then you get erm, Rivers, who's also a horrible character, although in a different way. Erm, they you wouldn't, you know, you'd imagine she didn't have a very opinion of the male sex altogether wouldn't you ? Yes. You would. Erm and you'd thi I mean,it's also true that she didn't know many. No. Yeah. That's true. I mean, she knew, her brother isn't it? Mm mm. her father Mm mm. Mm. and erm I mean there was th the curate who that she eventually married but, really they wouldn't know, they wouldn't have any male friends. But she made up her mind, didn't she, that she had to publish this book under a man's name? Mm. So she must have been really, had really deep feelings about what was going on in society and why she should do that. Yes. You know, I mean, er, that is why it's all coming out in the books, that's why the, all these men, she's sort of saying I'll get my own back now, you know! I can have anything I want amongst Yes. these vicious, nasty brutes not, yeah because That they she realized how she was living. Mm. If they're brought up, I mean,th the child at the beginning is more sinned against than sinning, it's not his fault he's a pain in the backside, it's his brother! Oh yes! It's him! He's the one er a pa re well or a as you say, Branwell was the same, brought up, he was spoiled rotten! Yeah. Yeah. And how can you expect to turn out reasonable? Mm. Mm. So,sa her comment probably is erm on the upbringing rather than anything else. Yeah. I mean, she doesn't mention this specifically, but, I mean, But Mrs Kissett Though there's a certain amount of indulgence with boys. Yes. You know. Yes. Oh! In, then there was. Probably knocked the top off the tree. Oh! He's a boy, type Yes. of thing, you know. Make them feel that they're treated as different. So I can see, you know, Yeah. You know. It's interesting that he dies, as well Branwell. Yes. In the end. There are So so in the end she got her come-uppance. They all get Well their come-uppance ! they do in spite Er, Mrs Grant er, absolutely spoilt her own girls which she knows you know Mrs Reed. Mrs Reed Mrs Reed Yes. didn't she? She did, yes. Yes. Oh well. Yeah. And, whereas, her father he, he didn't think of much of the girls at all did he? Ca and it was all for the son. Erm, I think he became very proud of Charlotte. Mm. Erm, but I think he tended to leave the bringing up of the girls to his sister-in-law. Oh! Eileen. Er, and I mean, as was conventional in those days, you educate, your sons went to school and you try and, educated your girls at home, but the, the aunt put her foot down and said she wouldn't do it. Oh! Aunt Branwell. So that's why the girls went to Cowan Bridge. Erm but, yes, I mean, he was launched into several different careers by his father with money he could ill spare. Course! Mm. Really. Mm. But erm that didn't, no, that wasn't on offer for the girls. It wasn't available. Well that came up in Anne in Anne Bronte's book as well didn't he? Yes. You know Oh yes! the position of women, I mean, they they were obviously all kicking against it, and They were, yes. Helen Huntingdon's statement Yes! to Gilbert Markenham, his mother Mm. Yes, that happened. that you would have boys go out with no forewarning, tripping over stumbling blocks here, there and everywhere and girls who are not even allowed to benefit from others' experience, let alone, have their own. That's right. Mm mm. Mm. Erm having said that I think the novel is al is a spiritual journey erm not only Jane's, I should say, but also Rocheter Rochester's. Erm, and I think it's also a journey towards independence, and a journey fro towards belonging, if you like from being an outcast to belonging. Mm. Oh yes! Er, she is unwanted, because she's different, because she's alien as a child, isn't she? In the Reed's household. She says, as an adult, looking back, I know why they didn't want me. Mm. I was so different. And why they didn't like me. Erm and that's, of course, why she's so delighted when she finds that the Rivers are her relations. Mhm. Mm. Er, and can share her, er, legacy with them. Erm and then, of course, in the end she belongs entirely to Rochester. And that's a free gift isn't it? No, that's got horrible commercial overtones! I don't mean that. I mean, it's a, a gift freely given. He, he's brought her free choice. Yes. It seems to me that she's also saying, it's also a plea, on Charlotte Bronte's behalf to men, to want women who come to them developed, independent and Mm. choose to give it up, as must the man, in Mm. marriage. Don't you, almost, you can almost hear behind the text saying, wouldn't you rather have a woman like that Mm. than a woman who's always been either under her father's thumb, or brother's thumb, and then gets passed to yours? Mm mm. Wouldn't you rather have a woman with a mind of her own? Yes. Er, oh yes! Can't say no to this . Depends on the men. I don't think in those days they wanted women with minds of their own, did they? Well, er St John certainly didn't! I would. I would. No. Oh. Right. Erm speaking Rochester realizes her worth doesn't he? He does, yes. Mm. Very much so. He does. Yes. Erm and they are both passionate people. Mm. And he was very changed. Yes. He was. He changed. He almost bu became very humble and grateful, of course. Cos she looked after him so Yes. but he was very arrogant in the beginning. Erm, let's look at a few quotations. Er, I don't suppose anybody's got the copy I've got which is from a jumble sale. Erm, the Zodiac Press. I've never heard of it before, but No? No, right. So we are the end of chapter six. I've just got that, chapter six. The end, the end. Paragraph beginning, Helena speaking She has been, been unkind to you. Right at the end, last page. Yes? Are we all there? Jane has just told Helen Burns her story. And I think she's just been erm has she been humiliated by him yet? No. Perhaps she hasn't. Erm,Well, I asked impatiently, is not Mrs Reed a hard-hearted bad woman ? And Helen replies,she has been unkind to you, no doubt because, you see, she dislikes your cast of character as Miss Scatcherd does mine. But, how minutely, you remember all she has done and said to you. What a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart. No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings. Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions if excited? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world. But the time will soon come when I trust we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies, when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh and only the spark of the spirit will remain. The impalpable principle of life and thought, pure as when it left the creator to inspire the creature. Whence it came it will return, perhaps again, to be communicated to some being higher than man, perhaps to pass through gradations of glory from the pale human soul to brighten the seraph. Surely, it will never, on the contrary be suffered to je to degenerate from man to fiend? No, I cannot believe that. I hold another creed, which no one ever taught me and which I seldom mention, but in which I delight and to which I cling, for it extends hope to all, it makes eternity a rest a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss. Besides, with this creed I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime, I can so sincerely forgive the first, while I abhor the last with this creed revenge never worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low, I live in calm looking to the end . Now, we've seen Jane as a passionate, spirited outspoken little girl haven't we? Quite justifiably I Mm. think. She really has been treated badly at the Reeds. And we're beginning to see her a co coming under Helen's influence. Mm mm. Being tempered by Helen. I think the first evidence we have of that, is when Brocklehurst has placed her on the stool and publicly humiliated her. And this Miss Temple asks her in her well in her own study, to tell her story. And bearing in mind, Helen's advice she doesn't er, express all the resentment she once felt or se or the er, let her speech run away with her. Mm. And she is wholly believed because of that. Mm. Mm. Mm. In my book, the notes, er from out of this I have another a er ano I have creed, it's got Charlotte Bronte's own belief. Mm. Yes. And Anne's too, I think. If you remember this, er, the death of erm Huntingdon? Mm mm. When the tenant of Wildfowl Hall Mm. Mm. But at er, Helen er fervently believed that his spirit would saved. That the creator would not, what was the, the saying? Dispense with anything he hath made. But erm and, Charlotte believed it too, yes! Mm Yes? Seem to be, in all these novels though, runs outs, a lot on lists of er, middle . There's always this sermonizing isn't there? You know, that it helping to sort of make the reader er, the thing about . Well, Christian virtues and duty were very closely erm That's right. er, related in, in Victorian society, you know. Yes. It's some aspired to them, and some hypocro hypocritically sat behind them. Like Brocklehurst coming in and and penny-pinching about what the girls should have and then his wife and daughters come in dressed in velvets and furs and so on. Oh yes. And retribution very often comes, I think, in the books in this life as well, they, I mean, again in Middlemarch, I think you get your deserts don't you, and er You do. Yes. I mean, Helen Burn's plea here is not to be to eager for retribution to come in this life, but trust to it erm In the next . well, not to come in the next,but rather to you know, sort of leave it to a higher justice if you like. Cos she separated sin from the sinner in Yes. Exactly! Yes. Which she has to learn to do in Mm. the case of Rochester isn't it? She has to learn to separate his crime of attempted bigamy from his love for her. Which she does. Mm mm. Helen, of course, is based on depiction of Helen, on Maria Bronte. Oh! The eldest girl who died when she was twelve. Mm. And who was a little mother Mm. to the whole brood. And they all where heartbroken Mm. you know, when she died. Must have been absolutely shattering wouldn't it? Erm right now, can following loosely this idea of spiritual development if you go to the end of chapter twenty four That goes into volume two does it? Er, I haven't got them divided into Oh, mine are in volumes. volumes in mine I'm afraid. Oh! Well this isn't Two hundred. It's two hundred. Have you got the same copy? Well mine's er, I've got three and then six. Yeah, have a look by all means, yes. This is the There's plenty there. Down there. Three O two, in wo one of them, the twenty fourth. Three O two. Yes. Pardon? Oh! Ta. Right. The last, paragraph of the chapter, twenty four. This is a first period of courtship if you like. Erm when ah,Jane in a sense is having to keep his passion at bay, his impatience er, for their wedding at bay, by teasing him. Yet, after all, my task was not an easy one often I would rather have pleased than teased him. My future husband was becoming to me my whole world, and more than the world, almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought of religion as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not in those days, see God for his creature, of whom I had made an idol . Oh no! Danger isn't it? Mm. Those are the warning signs. It's too much. It's too much. It can't, even had they married at this stage it would not have been right. Even had he been unmarried. Because Jane did not look on him as a, as a man but as an idol. Mm. She didn't know him well enough. Er, and I think that's an interesting point that, where yo where, when you read the story and you think really what prevented them marrying happily then, was Bertha but it wasn't it was their attitudes to each other. Mm. Shall we break for a drink now? And Mm. erm Mm! meet again at five to? Mm! Yes? for the sake of recording? We are Erm we have St John's proposal to her. Shall I read it very briefly it takes er time to to find it doesn't it? Er she but, as brother and sister erm Simplify your complicated interest , St John says to her,feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims, merge all considerations in one purpose that of fulfilling with effect, with power, the mission of your great master. To do so, you must have a coadjutor, not a brother, that is a loose tie, but a husband. I too, do not want a sister, a sister might any day be taken from me. I want a wife, the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life and retain absolutely till death . Well she describes that as like an iron shroud. Turning . And then a few pages on when she says, erm we must abandon the scheme of marriage. No! It, said he, it is a long-cherished scheme and the only one which can secure my great end . My great end? But I shall urge you no further at present tomorrow I leave for Cambridge. I have many friends to whom I should wish to say farewell. I shall be absent a fortnight. Take that space of time to consider my offer, and do not forget that if you reject it, it is not me you deny, but God. Through my meanings, he opens to you a noble career, as my wife only can you enter upon it. Refuse to be my wife and you limit yourself forever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity . If that isn't Erm erm arrogance there. yes, religious arrogance, I don't know what is. I mean he says he's he knows that he is erm poor material, that he's inadequate, inadequacies will be made up by God. Oh! But, if you reject it, but it's not me you deny, but God. His ego is enormous! Mm. Erm Beyond the truth. Yes. and it certainly makes you feel more favourably towards Rochester doesn't it ? Yes I think so, yes. Erm, but that is, in a sense, part of Jane's spiritual education isn't it? Mm. She has to learn to distinguish betwe sh to, to recognize the falseness of that statement. Mm. Mm. To sort God from St John Rivers if you like. And she does. Mm. Mm mm mm. Well she wants to be his curate, er, she does use the curate. She does, yes. Yes. And, erm Yes! oh, I mean er, I know we can have different opinions on why we think St John is so adamant that she must be his wife I do think it's a power struggle. I don't think he's come across any Mm. so independently minded, as Jane. And he can't erm he can't quite live with that. He certainly isn't going to live with it independent. He's going to have it under his thumb. It did rather stretch But erm my credulity when she wandered over the Moors and she was at death's door, and she turned up at her cousins' Well hou house . Yes. I mean it Is that, erm is, I mean we, we can look at that two ways, I mean is that divine intervention? Mm. Erm, coincidence? Or, as you say, beyond the bounds? Yes. But still it's all part of the . Well the psycho Well the, the plot. the psychopathic communication at the end when they come together Yes. again, I mean that is stretching the bounds the belief a bit far. Well that is er I mean,cle clearly Yes, the voice of Yes. Mm. Mind you, it, Yes it did. Erm it, it, you know,th if she cle Charlotte Bronte clearly believes in divine intervention doesn't she? And in, in the context of what sh of what she was writing Mm. and when she was writing. Yeah, I think it's fair enough. I mean, it stretches our belief cos Yes. we don't believe that you can Yes. hear voices up above. Is this the creed? I don't know. I but I believe in telepathy. But of course, I, is that what Yes I believe in telepathy, but I don't believe in in G and I shall come Yeah. to you and Yes. he heard the voice say You can't, no Oh no, not that both listened in at the time. Dorothy? Although, I do think that probably erm, religion at that time er, could have been this very narrow, rigid Mm. kind of erm, idea. I mean, the church preached, probably erm this kind of religion, or some of the churches Mm mm. did. Mm. You know, this sort puritan, I suppose erm you know, following the puritan tradition. Yes. But, they were very narrow, very rigid Yes. and erm That's right. cos you might say, that it was all for the sort of, poor old pe people down. Ooh, you could certainly say that, yes. Mm. Erm But in the middle of this we've still got a fairly young woman with vivid imagination. Mm. Yes. We have. Yes. Yes. Yeah. And strong feeling. Yeah. Yes! Yeah. Mm. Yes. Erm, in a sense you have, it, it's, it's erm a a spiral construction isn't it? A sort of, a triangular if you like you start off with one position, represented by Rochester, which is, too much passion, uncontrollable passion Mm. almost. I mean,a apart from Bertha, I know he was tricked into it by his father and brother, that marriage, but he Yes. surely wouldn't have gone through it if Bertha hadn't appealed to him. No. No. Erm, if he hadn't wanted her, at least, at first . Well Jean Rhys says that she's a beauty. Yes. Absolutely! Yes. But she also had a big dowry. Yes. Well that was the the father and brother who saw Yes. that didn't they? Yeah. Erm There was and then he has erm, erm Madame Varens, doesn't he? Adele's Oh yes. mother. Yes. Yes. And, or Mademoiselle. Yes, that's right. And then Clara, and er, somebody's else's name I Oh yes. can't remember. Yes. Yeah. Erm and then we come, as it were, to the second position which is St John Rivers Mm. who actually does fall in love who would have him Oh! and suppresses er Rosamond Oliver, suppresses that totally in his nature. Erm, for his religious mission. Mm! And then you come to Rochester at the end erm oh well, I mean, without finding quotations erm he is the synthesis isn't it? He is the meeting of the two points. He Mm is erm you know, the, the the one erring lamb, if you like, that comes back. And erm I mean, accepts Jane, and thanks God and determines to be better. You know, he reforms doesn't he? Mm. But without any of the religious priggishness Mm. that we've seen from St John Rivers. Did he turn to Jane Eyre erm after he'd been rejected by erm the other woman, the Oliver woman? No. No! No, he'd ha she'd had it ? Yes. I, I mean, I think he he shows her no encouragement Cos she went off with another chap Instead of. Yeah. instead of. He, he then thought right,whe who can I look for now type of thing? Wha what happened first? Do you see what I mean? I think they drifted apart, Rosamond and St John They did. or at least She did. But she was eminently unsuitable wasn't she? That was the ploy that Yes! she was completely unsuitable for the like he was determined to meet. Yes. They couldn't marry,e even though he loved her. Yes, er Too much conflict and She would have a miserable life, of course. Mm. Oh yes! She really would. Well any wife of his would have had a miserable life! I have no time for St John Rivers at all! No. Erm And he was such a hypocrite wasn't he? He was Yes. He was a hypocrite. hypocrite. He, one of these people who allies their own opinions and feelings with the higher authority that they erm with God. Exactly! It's, it's that er in Jane Austen's That they were recognized. er er, which one is Collins. Collins. Collins. Oh yes! In his, yeah, the thing Oh yes! That's right. Yeah, he he is . Yes. He is indeed. They, they must have existed these characters Oh yes! that, you know, clergy mustn't Yes! they? Yes. Lu Lutheran agrees hypocrisy that kind of religion. There is a such Yes. It's impossible to carry out. I knew one once. Yes. You did? Oh! I sympathize! Yes. Yes. But, on the other hand I wonder how any of them were really, I mean er our own Minister at our own church, he is extremely intellectual and very theological, and a wonderful man of compassion. These men were just given livelihoods weren't they? Yes. Mm. To, trot up all these awful ones. They weren't very That's right, yes. which I don't think they were truly good, it was quite a good, reasonable living wi with a house thrown in. But it wasn't a calling. No. No. No. It wasn't a vocation. Not at all! But they thought Not a vocation. it was didn't they? They pretend it was but i didn't you send your Oh yes. wasn't it the third of fourth son Third. who went into the Went into church. church? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Was it, the first to the army Army, the law Yes. or The law, that's it. So it was only third choice was it? Arithmetic. I'm informed it's usually the fourth. I don't, I don't know if it's It's the third or fourth. Oh yes! In Charlotte . . But the, the a child a year eighteen children Yes. Oh right. Erm Let's come to the Gothic in Jane Eyre, in why, in a sense,i it's in our reading lis it's on our reading list this term. Mhm mm. Let me read you a couple of paragraphs from er, an essay on the new Gothic in Jane Eyre , by erm, and American critic called Robert Harman. Some years ago Edmund Wilson complained of writers of Gothic who could fail to lay hold on the terrors that lie deep in the human soul and have caused man to fear himself. Unquote. And proposed an anthology of horror stories that probe psychological cabins and find disquieting obsessions. This is precisely the direction in which Charlotte Bronte moved. This was one aspect of her following human emotions where they took her, into many depths and intensities, that has yet hardly had a place in a novel. this was the finest achievement of Gothic. Gothic is variously defined. In a recent book review, Lesley Fiedler implies that Gothic is shoddy mystery mongering. Whereas, F Cudworth-Flint defines the Gothic tradition, which he considers nearly central in American literature, as a literary exploration of the avenues to death. For Montagu Summers, on the other hand, Gothic was the essence of romanticism, and romanticism was the literary expression of supernaturalism. Both these latter definitions, though they are impractically inclusive, have suggested value. For originally, Gothic was one of the number of aesthetic developments which serve to breach the classical and rational order of life, and to make possible a kind of response, and a response to a kind of thing that among the knowing had long been taboo. In the novel it was the function of Gothic to open horizons beyond social patterns, rational decisions, and institutionally approved emotions. In a word, to enlarge the sense of reality and its impact on the human being. It became, then, a great liberator of feeling, but acknowledged the non-rational in the world of things and events, occasionally in the realm of the transcendental, ultimately, and most persistently in the depths of the human being. The first Gothic writers took the easy way. The excitement of mysterious scene and happening, which I call old Gothic. Of this, Charlotte Bronte made some direct use, while at the same time tending towards humorous modifications, which are anti-Gothic. But what really counts is this indirect usefulness to her, it released her from the patterns of the novel of society and therefore, a laugh about it as well? What about home? I mean er, I wonder in fact I mi I might as you this question, have you discussed er sex with your parents? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And, in this hundred sixty one, yes thirty nine, no. Does, do those votes surprise you? Do you think er yes? I think that everyone seems to pass the buck, I mean the parents think, oh they'll learn it at school and the teachers think, oh co they should be learning it from their parents, and yo , you never learn it from anyone just from your friends. Yes? I think erm sexuality begins with sensuality and therefore it should begin in the home, and it should be exaggerated at school, I mean, it should helped but fundamentally it's with your parents or guardians whoever, who should begin it. Is that your experience? Yeah, I mean I'm I'm very lucky because my parents are very liberal, and I mean they discussed sex with me quite early on and I've never had a problem discussing it with them. But that's not the case with everyone er I mean un unfortunately I wish it was. Yes? Yeah, that i , is precisely, it isn't the case with everyone, I mean, I think that what the girl was saying up there about the groups going round, it's a great idea! It was the same in the biology, biology teacher at our school, it was very hush hush and very embarrassed. Mm. I think if you got maybe a twenty five year old who came to your school for a week and got you in a small group and talked about it, it would be great on a one to one basis. Mhm. Erm,a , my mother didn't speak to me about sex until I was pregnant! You know which I I i wa , I wasn't totally embarrassed about it but I just we , I think she was, you know, that sort of generation and that era, which I hope with my son it will be totally different, like come to me and say anything you like, you know? Yeah. I'm a liberal parent. Yes? Yeah, there's probably two points I would want to say, one is that, what about the children and young people tha that refuse to go to school? And where's the education for them? I think the other one, about the woman across there said about, should start at home with sensuality and stuff and many of the young women that I work wi , I've I've heard very negative experiences of sex Mhm. through sexual abuse, and I think we spend a lot of our time, and I think even for teachers, we spend a lot of our time undoing a lot of the damage of helping young people, undo a lot of damage that's done by sex. I don't think they view it as a dead happy, enjoyable, fun thing and it's something that that they do if you say, is really serious and Mm. something that is nay er positive for them. It doesn't matter, I mean, where or whom you've been told by, as long as you've been told you can take precautions later in life from sexual diseases and and getting yourself pregnant. Mhm. What comes into sex education? I mean,th tha tha that's interesting what you said, because you said how to avoid sexual diseases and to er avoid getting pregnant, are those the basics of sex education or or what more would put onto the list of things that you would teach? Yes? I think when somebody teaches it they teach it in the premise that everybody they're talking to is heterosexual. What about people that are homosexual? What about like contraception should be integral part of it, and abortion and the options open to you, but I think it's very important that we are taught it, we're taught it in a heterosexual basis, and that's just not the case, and that just alienates people any more, really more from a very early age. Mhm. I'm still doing sex education at schools and look like it's changing a lot cos there's a lot more to do there, a lot more emphasis on Aids, that's why they've got to ki , teach kids in primary school, we've got to prevent them from getting a disease. Mhm. I was gonna say about sex education that when I was learning at school, it's also very male dominated erm it was, I mean you were talking about erm what's i li , the differences between males and females learning about sex education and wha , and we were learnt about the the man having pleasure, we were taught about the man having the erection and the man having the orgasm, I mean, we didn't even know what a clitoris was! Th I mean, I've never even heard of the term clitoris, and a friend of mine thought her clitoris was actually her epiglottis, I mean it just got the whole the thing just got completely confused. And that's when But do you think it's appropriate to teach sex in that kind of detail to to school children? Erm To tau , to teach pe , school children about sexual pleasure for instance, er er er rather than the biological facts of reproduction? I think it's part and parcel of sex, and so, yes, I do think it is very important and I think it is a process that does have to, have to be started very young, and is on-going throughout our education. Now I would guess that goes further that most school curricular. I mean has anyone learnt about sexual pleasure, at er, at school? Or about er, the male and female orgasms? Well obviously you learn about the male orgasm because that's what creates a baby but I think she was right, the female orgasm is never mentioned but it's there or should be. Ha! Yep? I think it's very important that er females should be taught that it's pleasurable for them as well, you Mm. haven't just to literally lie back there and the man says what happens, when it happens, and they're to do as they're told sort of thing because that obviously develops sexual abuse, women being raped, and attitudes that lead towards these things. It's very important you're taught that, er such feelings as respect, love, emotions all come into this and a woman has a right to say no, if she doesn't Yeah. want this, and it's not up to a man to decide what happens. But it seems that that isn't what's being taught, and therefore,in information about that comes, well either via your own experience or talking with friends or reading womens' magazines or I mean whe , where do we actually get our education from? Learn through Like you said more through magazines than I did at school, because in school I was taught nothing about pleasure, it was all very biological with a diagram of the male and the female, exactly what happened, there was nothing about er, sexually transmitted diseases, pleasure or abortion, contraception, nothing mentioned, only the mere basics. Now, normally in this programme when we talk about womens' magazines, people are inveighing against them because they carry various advertisements that they find offensive or exploitative, but are women's magazines actually erm performing quite a useful job by filling in the gaps that that schools and parents are are failing to address? What do you think? Any, yes? I think they're a very dangerous mode of education because they provide a very stereo-typed image of everything, everybody that they're talking about if they're talking about sex, they presume to be able bodied, they're presumed to be white generally, they're presumed to be heterosexual, if they're talking about homosexual then, it's definitely male lesbians Mhm. never come into it. I'm sorry, but I think these must be in the wrong magazines! The magazines that are out today are very informative of where you can get the addresses of places to go, they give both sides of homosexuality you know, male and female as far I've seen, and definitely in the past two years or so. Now, is that our best hope, is is is is the commercial provision of womens' magazine is the best hope we have for getting in, in any information we want? I mean, in an ideal world what wha what agenda would you draw up? I don't think it's necessarily about teaching er children primarily about sex or about sexual pleasure, I think it's all, initially, about personal hygiene and then developing that into how they can make their life safer for themself , or giving them choices to say, well I can choose to become pregnant or not to become pregnant and, I think it's more about choices rather than saying orgasms and erm sexual pleasure, or Mm. telling youngsters, when they can't actually understand the concept of having sex. Mm. Yes? I think if erm, perhaps if television did something more about it you'd be able to erm, home in on the people who are excluded, erm, people who are outside school, school situations, people Mhm. who don't actually go to school. Erm, looking at certain problems, a lot of erm young women who get pregnant don't get pregnant at school, they get pregnant as soon as they leave school. Mhm. Erm, in say, an area, a a deprived area it's very often hard for women to get access to information. Basically, there's a comparison of figures that erm one pregnancy in every two hundred and fifty six in Morningside is to women under twenty, yet one in four in, in an area like Craigmiller is to women under twenty so there's a big sort of difference. And you need to access, you need to key in to certain areas as well, so television could be the ideal way to do that. But it's not doing it at the moment, although there's Well no it certainly doesn't seem to be with, one in four girls getting pregnant. Well people generally complain about sex on television so, the way it's being presented. Up there. You often find that erm television with sex and everything, they always put it on after a certain time for children go to bed. It's like, Aids and that like the glue sniffing advert, for instance, put on fo when the children go to bed, but they should be able to see that,sho , they should be able to see look, well that's putting a message across to me as well , not just the parents, to me, I'm the one that's involved and I think that if well maybe the the producers would maybe or the people that do television would maybe put i to say, seven o'clock or that, where young children primary school age can actually sit and watch it. I think if you got taught sex education in maybe, smaller groups, you know erm if they could with individual teachers Mhm. er they, you know, were people that you trust and that you could ask questions that you wouldn't be embarrassed Mhm. that'd help a lot. Yes? Erm, I think if they were more honest and open, I mean like parents and schools and stuff, it wouldn't be so difficult for people to talk about it, and there wouldn't be as many, the jokes about it. If if everybody spoke about, the communication was better then it'd be a lot easier for people that deal with it. Yeah? Beside you. I think it's just our culture as well Mm. that influences our opinions on it, you know. And, I think it's really important that sex education in schools should be taught by somebody that the pupils can relate to. Cos I know when I was at school we actually got our sex education in fourth year, and it was by a visiting lecturer, it was this wee old man about fifty, he said basically, this is a male body, this is a female body, nothing about sexuality, orgasms anything! It was terrible! So I Aha. think that's really important. I'm going back to the thing about erm and boys and Mhm. today, in school we had a two members of a family planning association and er, we were in group and we actually had the guys in our class, they're seventeen, maybe eighteen sitting laughing and sniggering between themselves! And that's at that age! And I would say, in our school we've had the Aids team in and we've talked quite a lot about sex education and they're still sniggering! They're still having their jokes between Mm mm. themselves Mm. and whatever. I don't think we're ever gonna get away from that. Why do you think that is? It's I don't know what it was, er they hardly, we were having a discussion with the doctor, erm none of them would put forward their opinions or their views or what they thought No. we're talking about abortion, who's responsibility it was, erm they just were nay prepared to put forward their opinions. Is that your common experience that that young men aren't aren't really up to this? Yeah? No. I work for the same pre project as Verity and I worked with five, fifteen, sixteen year old boys, just yesterday, and they were one of the best groups I'd ever worked with because Mhm. they were interested. And it was contraception, which as you all know, is predominantly female and they were interested like, what their partners would use, what they will use and, it was wonderful! I couldn't believe because I always thought that it was the guys that sniggered, the guys that weren't interested Mm mm. and through past experience it is changing. Was it a mixed group or er No. No, we had five sa , boys no mixed. Do you think ma , do you think maybe that's, that's one of the answers, to separate the sexes for, for these discussions or No, I think maybe if the girls had been in they might have been a bit shier and felt you know, oh we have to act you know, the lads. Yeah. You know, so maybe but Yes? I think the guys snigger because they're covering up for their embarrassment that's Mm. their way of breaking the ice and showing that they just, they, that's way of coping with it. I think that they may be frightened to speak up and that they're scared that if they say something that they don't know, like a lot of them don't know the facts, like today, in the same class as Janine across there, some of them didn't know even the very the pro , progression of the male pill or anything like that, and they did learn a few things but a again they never spoke up and they weren't interested, but I Mm. think it was because of embarrassment. Yeah? Up there. I think, you know, I think in answer to the embarrassment question, I think although it is about that erm, people are nay do, people wi on just are nay prepared to commit with information, I think, in areas there's a wealth of information and experience Mm. and people who are prepared to discuss the issue but they just don't come out the door to where erm, the people are that need the information. I Mm. think there has to be a er family planning centres have to more on the street, I think family planning clinics have got the people there who are able to go out on the street. I think the other issue is that we have to be defending erm, the family planning centres that are being closed down, like the forty or fifty in Glasgow, the thirteen in er Edinburgh,th the east of Scotland Mhm. and I think that is just gonna create you know, a bigger ignorance amongst young people erm, you know a bigger ignorance about contraception itself Mhm. which again, there is nay a hundred percent safe contraception Mhm. to prevent pregnancy, or any other disease for that matter. And I think that's something that we're gonna have to start er defending, you know, because we er er, we, we have got a wealth of experience and information it just has to be shared. You're not suggesting pregnancy's a disease there are you? For some of us, aye, yeah. A It is a disease! In Holland er, young teenagers are taught in school how to how to use condoms, now I don't know whether that's taught in schools or, or classes in Scotland,i is it? It should be! Has anyone, I mean has anyone had that experience? Yes? Well I got a video and, like, that's all we got a few videos and the video showed you how to use a condom, and that was it. And that was at school? Yeah. But that's probably more than a lot of people did, and everyone's being urged to use condoms, but how many people are actually given any instruction on how to use them? Yes? Well yesterday we actually went to to a school and you show them how to use with a condom demonstrator and allow them to touch the condoms, and in youth clubs you allow them to do practically anything with them, as long as they're returned, they can blow them up, or they can Yeah. shoot them across the room or whatever. But I think all the silliness is all part of actually adjusting to the condom, and something to do with the embarrassment that because they don't know enough about it they, they don't want to be er, seen to be silly Mm. so, they put up a front, and Mm. I think it's all part of it, that they will be silly initially, but they'll som , soon co , er come to realize that it's sensible. Mhm. In a, in our school we were shown by our guidance teacher how to put a condom and he used a banana so, that just shows you that that can happen. And we it was fourth year when we done it and we'd never been shown anything like that and it was interesting because it's the sort of fact that you you never really think about Mhm. until yo you're actually gonna do it, sort of thing which I thought it was interesting. Do you think er, as young women you have a right, on behalf perhaps, of women ten years younger than you, to suggest changes in what's happening now? You're obviously in, and the other people in the, in the Brook are er advisory peer groups, are are doing work, people are suggesting, they they they think that should be extended, what more might be done? Audrey? I think it erm it possibly could be politicized and actually funded. I was wondering if erm the girl at the back was actually a volunteer or if she was in fact, paid for her work? Because I I do know of of various different groups who are working in this field as volunteers, there's no money behind them there, and I mean i i it should be a priority, it should be given that kind of priority where Mhm. funds are made for it. Mhm. Voluntary. It is voluntary. Yeah. I mean, yes? Can I just say that, about the age thing again, erm, I also do, with the Brook Peer Group Right. and erm I went to a youth club and I I was speaking to eight year olds and they're asking about condoms cos they've seen them in the street, so it's obviously they're wanting to find out about it cos it's everywhere around them even, doesn't matter what age. And what will you tell an eight year old? Erm, well we let them and again we brought out the demonstrator and we let them touch condoms erm do anything they wanted with them as long as we got them back. But they're fi , they're going to find about it cos it's everywhere. I think one of the main points is not so much the way it's taught but who teaches it. Because, going back to the point earlier on, erm, when I was taught I say, it was a local nurse from th er, the clinic that taught us I mean I've nothi , nothing against elder women in their fifties and whatever, but I mean, there again, one, it shouldn't always be females who teach about sex, it should be males, and it should be younger people to relate Mhm. to, because, one of the main points about the embarrassing er aspect, mainly boys sniggering and giggling, whatever, maybe some girls do, but it's mainly er, males, I think a point to be made there is, it is a well known fact that boys took longer to mature emotionally than girls and I think if it was a guy a younger guy, maybe in his late twenties, early thirties teaching it, and if he had the sort of guts to turn round and the bravery to say look son, what is it you're laughing at, what's so funny? I mean Mm. you're seventeen years old, if you're old enough to have sex surely you're old enough to you know, think about it in a mature way. And it would ta , take someone like that just to make them think, yeah, well, you know what is so funny in get rid of this sort of stigma about boys being immature. I also work for the peer group for the Brook Mhm. and er, we have two boys that do it with us as well and when they come out to youth clubs with us the girls and the boys that we go and speak to love having a male there Mhm. that they can go and the boys have a good laugh with them, and the girls have a good laugh as well and it seems to work. A , any concluding thoughts on er on the future for sex education in Scotland? I'd agree that it's important Yeah. that people can make their o , they have a balanced education which allows them then to make their own choices about, that things aren't over, I mean if we've lived in a patriarchal society in which men are in power and that kin , and male sexuality maybe has come through more in sex education, those have been the issues that have been co ,ha have been given more importance and female issues have maybe been neglected a little bit and now erm, with Aids as a problem we don't want to turn out and suddenly become really homo homophobic or really, you know, right condoms, condoms, it has to be you know, you need to kind of keep the balance so that people are given the information and then have the freedom to make the choice themselves. I think they should get rid of the stigma in condoms, cos what frightens me is that in about ten years time my daughter will come and maybe ask if she can go on the pill and at least I can tell her no, use a condom there's less chance of sexually transmitted diseases, but it's my sons they won't come and ask. Yes? I think the problem is, that at the moment sex education is so arbitrary and it varies from school to school and from house to house I think they have to make it like a core part of the curriculum, make it compulsory and make it uniform throughout the country, so everybody's getting the same education, the same quality I think that'll help. Lots of good ideas. Thank you very much for discussing this and opening up watch, what is, too often a a a taboo area. I hope you found it interesting? I have. And thanks for joining us. Goodbye.

Yeah. You've all got questions, yeah? Yeah. Because we've got twenty five minutes but twenty five minutes can either drag or can fly by. Let's see if we can make the twenty five minutes fly by, yes? Oh these are a nosy lot aren't you? Eh? Good. Alright then. Ready to start? Yeah. Right, let's go. First question. How do you train a a police dog? How do you train a police dog. Right. Before you can become a police er dog handler Yeah. you have to do two years in the police force anyway, you then have to show some kind of application towards it. You are then go on a course and you are selected. If you are selected to go on another course, you are introduced to your dog. That's down in er Kent somewhere, I've forgotten where it is but it's down in Kent. While you're there you have thirteen weeks down there, which is like three months, with th with the dog. If you pass the course down there with your dog, yeah? You are then sent back to your force which is a which will be the Essex Police because I'm a member of the Essex Police. Alright? You then work with your dog the whole time and all the time you're working with your dog, naturally enough, it's a young dog, so you're being tested and evaluated the whole time, so your training continues. But initially you have to show a skill, or some kind of application, to be a dog trainer. You go away for thirteen weeks on a course with the dog, you're introduced to the dog you're gonna work with, yeah? Yeah. And if you pass that test you go back to your police force and you are evaluated and having tests all the time. Well that's how they train them, they train them in er what they call public order work, in the case of chasing people and all that, they also have tracking and all kinds of things, okay? Mm. Is that i does that answer your question? Yeah. Alright. How many of you have seen policemen wor Shh shh have you seen policemen working with dogs? Yeah. Would you What do you think? What do you tell P C that you've seen? What did you see? I've seen What did you see Nigel? I suppose erm I went to this club, went to this club with erm dogs showing erm tracking down er Tracking people down? Yeah, tracking people Burglars. Burglars, yeah. Was you, was er everyone in this class here when a gentleman by the name of erm Steve brought his dog here? Yeah. Oh that's when we saw Do you remember? Yeah. Yeah well what class are you in now? Mr Now what, what, how long, how many years have you been here, this class? Er three years. Five. Five. Five years? Yeah You may have been in they may been in the infants when Ooh think Who can remember that police dog coming here? Yeah? Well he's still working but cos that dog's a lot older, and a lot more grumpier they can't take the dog to the schools any more. He's not so, he doesn't like it coming to schools any more. He's a, he's a bit like an old man now, slightly bit grumpy. Well I hope I've answered that question. Next question. How do you become a policeman? How do you become a policeman, right. I can only pass comment on when I went through my training because it's all changed. Right, what happened was I sent away a letter to the Essex Police Force. They sent me a reply back and I sat an exam. The exam had basic maths, basic English in, which I passed. I then was sent a letter telling me that I'd passed this exam, I then had what's known as a medical to check that I was okay, there was no, I had no faults or injuries or health problems. I then did a physical which they made me run a mile and a half, did press ups, sit ups, which I passed. I then had to go and have an interview which I passed. After the intervoo intervoo I'm sorry Interview. Thank you, the in after the interview I went back to Chelmsford where is the headquarters of the Essex Police Force and had to do a course for two weeks. After I did the course for two weeks I went down to a place in Ashford and I was in Ashford for twelve weeks, came back to Chelmsford, did another two weeks and then I was released as what's known as probationer constable, a probationer constable. At that time you had to stay with your tutor constable who looked after you for twelve weeks. You went out and about for twelve weeks with your tutor constable, if you like, they call it puppy walking he was the highly trained policeman and I was the new policeman, I was with him for twelve weeks. After twelve weeks they decided I was okay,okay, you're allowed to go out and work on your own. And that was how I was trained and that way I was trained seven and a half years ago, it has now all changed again. I don't know the full system but you are being evaluated and tested the whole time. But the testing period the testing period is two years. Within that two years, any time within that two years you can basically be given the sack for not coming up to the grade or not coming up to scratch or sometimes they prolong your pr probation for another six months so instead of being a probationer constable for two years you're a probationer constable for two and a half years. Yeah? Yeah, thank you. Understand that? But within that probation period you can sort of like get dismissed for any time quite easily. Does that answer your question? Yeah. Hope it does. Yes? What is it like being a policeman? What's it like being a policeman? Great fun. Great fun, I really enjoy it. Do you know why I enjoy it? Because it's not boring. Every day is different. Like teaching. Like teaching. Every day is different, that's what makes it interesting. Because from the age of seventeen to twenty nine I worked on building sites, and that got boring so I changed and I changed and became a policeman, and I ca became a policeman when I was twenty nine and a half and it's, I've enjoyed it ever since cos every day is interesting, every day is different, every day is unusual. Right? Does that answer your question? Right. What is it like in court? What is it like in court. Right there are two kinds of courts that policemen, well there's several kinds of court, but the main courts that policemen go to are a magistrate's court where there is what's known as, they are magistrates or JPs, Justice of the Peace, and they sit there and you have to give evidence. That's quite scary. But the really scary place is what's known as a crown court where you have to give evidence at crown court. Have you seen the judge with his wig on? Yeah And the twelve jury? And they're all staring at you and when you're in the docks giving evidence, it is very very frightening. I've done it now about four times and I am still scared when I do it. When I've gone to crown court I am still petrified, that is really, really scary cos everyone in the room is hanging on your every word and if you make a mistake you start to sweat, your hands go clammy not very nice. Does that answer your question? What made you want to be a policeman. What made I wanted to be a policeman? Right, what made we want to be, I wanted to be a policeman when I was very young but never had the courage to do it. So when I got older and wiser I thought I'll give that a go and I've enjoyed it ever since. And now I look back on the years I wasted on the building sites and I should've become a policeman ea a lot earlier cos it's great fun. But perhaps you can, perhaps you can kno knock up jobs around the house for your wife and perhaps you can build houses. I'm not that good, I'm no D I Y freak, even now. Yes, your question? Erm what kind of erm equipment do you use when, when erm you've been reported a, a robbery? Alright, what kind of equipment does a policeman wear, right. I didn't bring any of it with me but everyone's seen the tall hat haven't they? Yes. That's what's known as the custodial hat, that's one, that's one Shh shh shh Yeah? There's the flat cap that I use in the car, yeah? You've all seen that. You've seen the mac, you've seen the yellow florry jacket, the fluorescent jacket that's another piece of equipment. My truncheon. My radio, the radio I carry with me and the radio that's in the car. Boots, trousers signs as well. Who's seen, who's seen police signs out the back of police cars that says slow down, danger? Yes,c or another sign that they put up by the side of the road is was you passing this spot this time last week did you see anything. That's in case there'd been a nasty accident, say there was an accident outside the school today, yes? Tomorrow they'll try and put up a sign to ask anyone who was passing if they saw the accident, yeah? We carry all kinds of equipment, our radio. We carry a little small radio that's the local one so anyone in Harlow carrying a radio would be able to talk to Harlow police station, yeah? But there's also a radio in the police cars that you can talk all the way over in Chelmsford which is twenty two, twenty three miles away, so you can t talk to someone in what the Essex Police call their information room, that's another piece of equipment. Another piece of equipment we've got is a pocket notebook, we write down everything we do. When I go back to the police station I'll write today that I've been at Harlowbury School all day doing a school visit and a school talk to different classes. That's my pocket notebook and I keep it up to date, that's another piece of equipment I use. Another piece of equipment I use is my boots, my shoes, my trousers, my clever truncheon pocket, it's a long thin pocket which I can put the truncheon in and it hides away. I didn't bring it here cos I'm not allowed to hurt my knee yeah? All bits, other bits of equipment as well, you've got sometimes in the back of police cars you've got brooms and shovels to clear the mess up off the road, yeah have you seen a policeman clearing up the road, saving people Yeah, yeah. driving over it and getting glass in their tyres? Yeah? All kinds of equipment. Different every day cos everything is different all the time, it keeps changing. Does that answer your question? Great. At the back young man. Er what was your first idea of what you was gonna be when you grow up in the first place? What was my first idea when, when I was little? Yeah. I wanted to join the army would you believe but I thought I want to join the army. I wanted to I want to but I might change. You might change, exactly, like I did. My brother's joined the army. Oh. I might join the ar I wanted to join the army first, yeah, and then I changed my mind. Well I think I changed Do you wanna be a policeman Oliver? Do you? My brother's a policeman Yeah a lot of people a lot of people wanna be policemen. I do too. But they change their minds they change, they become good at something else. Lot of, a lot of er lot of people always will change their Like a road worker. Like a road worker, anything couldn't they? Yes I know I'm joining the army. You wanna join the army do you? Good for you. Cos Beg your pardon? Got it down on a piece of paper . Oh have you? What's your question? Erm why do you have to be strong to be a policeman? You don't have to be strong to be a policeman. You don't have to that's er that's not totally true. You've just gotta have your wits about you that's all. Gotta be erm, not clever, not brainy, I think you've got to have common sense. The greatest a astribut attribute to be a policeman is to have common sense. What's common sense, you lot? Think about it, what's common sense? Think. Er like if you're really dumb common sense get er No see no no no, you could be very very clever very very clever and have absolutely no common sense, you might be, still be a very clever person, be brilliant at maths but have absolutely no common sense. You might not ha know how when someone says to you er thirty five pence please for a newspaper, you might not have the common sense to realize You haven't got it. You haven't got it, exactly. You must have common sense, that's most important. Next question. What is it like in the police station? What's it like in the police station, right. Has, does anyone watch The Bill? Yeah. My dad does. Right well Shh shh Have you s watched The Bill, do you watch them when they're inside the police station? It's all Yeah. it's all hustle and bustle isn't it? And then someone has a conversation with someone else and then someone else has a conversation with someone else and if a man was to walk right the way through the police station he has about five or six conversations, and by the time he gets to the other end of the police station he's forgotten the first conversation. It's like Miss, when she walks from the staff office to here, she could have four conversations and when she gets here she thinks what was the first conversation about again? It's like that, it's a little bit like it's a little bit like The Bill because there's about four or five different conversations. Alright? Next question. Yes young man. What was it like when you had your police dog? I have never had a police dog. I've never had, never been on er the special course. A lot of people like it because basically th er when you look after a police dog it becomes your pet as well, you take it home with you and you take it to work with you, and the u you'll have a police dog for sort of like its working life of seven to eight years, so basically you're gonna have him for seven to eight years and he becomes a fa like a family pet. I've never been on the course so I've never had a police dog. Yes? Why do you want to be a policeman? Why did I want to be a policeman. I don't know really. I always, I always, when I first wanted er when I was at school I always wanted to join the army and then I changed my mind and then I wanted to join the police force. And then I forgot about the idea and I just drifted into something else. Then it, then I saw an advert in the local paper and I thought yeah, I'll do that, I'll try and become a policeman. I sent away and passed the exams and I became a policeman, but I always wanted to become a policeman when I, from about eighteen or nineteen it's just that I drifted the wrong way. Yes? What is it like in jail? What's it like in jail. I've never been in jail and I never wanna find out what it's like in jail but if you actually ever go to the police station, Harlow police station, they sometimes let people up there and do tours, no one likes being left in the cell cos when the door closes it's very very small and it's very claustrophobic, and it's not very nice. So if I, I wouldn't, my answer to that is never go to jail cos it's, you're losing your freedom aren't you? You can't go down to the shops, you can't go round your mum's, you can't go to your auntie's, you're losing your freedom. And even in just the police station, in the small holding cells they have, it's not very nice. I personally would not like to be held in a c in a prison. I'm not that way inclined, I like to go for a walk and have the fresh air on me and everything. Yes? Where do you er keep all your, all the erm equipment that you take with you? Right. I we've all got lockers, you know like you've got a locker here for your books and everything? Yeah. We've all got a big long locker where we put all our different coats in and our boots and all our other equipment like a long thing I've seen it on The Bill. That's it, yes, like the lockers they use on The Bill, yes, that's, very similar to that, that's where, and you, and what, it's what's known as erm the locker room or the cha Yeah that's, that's right, yes. Your question? Well do you run after people? Have I run after people. Yes I do. At the moment I couldn't cos I've got a bad knee but I have run after people and caught people, yes. Because I'm getting a bit old I have a tendency to get out of breath. But I have run after people, yes. Yes young man? Why do policemen, why do policemen need dogs? Why do they need dogs, because their dogs their smell. They track down drugs. The class has an answered it for you, the class has answered it. They can track people down, they're very good They're not supposed to bite you see, they're supposed to chase and bark at someone and hold them there by barking and hope right that the police will turn up. That's the idea. Shh shh shh shh No you ma don't make it free for all. And because they smell along the floor. That's right,the their, their nose is very Shh their nose is very sensitive and I, if someone wa if someone walks across grass, yeah? Where the shoe touches the grass it crushes the grass and releases juices and smells from the grass. Me and you can't smell it but the dog Can. can, the dog can. Cos he's got something in his nose so he can smell anything. He's got very he's very sensitive cells in his nose because, cos a dog used to be a hunting dog, and goes back to being a wolf, they used to track their prey to eat so they've still got that ability and we haven't, but a dog has, it can smell. Next question, at the back. Erm do you erm drive after people and stop them from driving fast? I certainly do yes, but the ma the majority of that is done by traffic police, by traffic police. We do we, the ordinary shift does that but usually that's traffic police who do it. How many people have you caught? How many people have I caught, I couldn't tell you cos I've never kept a record. I've got one friend who has written down in a diary every person he's ever re arrested, I don't do that, I just, I, I can't be bothered to write it all down. Too long, waste too much time. Yes? Do you have to be there for a certain amount of time? That's all down if you're talking about jail, prison, that's all down to the m remember I went, talking to you about the court? That's all down to the magist court? To the courts, to the magistrates, remember that man, the judge, it's all down to him and the jury, it's not down to the police. It's wh that's everyone goes to court because it's it's down to the er ju what they call the judicial system to work it out what it is. My mother used to be in Did she? Good for her. Well done. Yes? Have you any,ev , have you ever put anyone in jail before? Have I ever put anyone in jail, right, when you mean jail do you mean the police station or prison? Prison. Prison. Prison, right. To actually get someone to prison is exceptionally hard. To get what they call, big word, custodial sentence, to actually give someone a custodial sentence is exceptionally hard. I personally, in all the cases I've dealt with, which is seven and a half years, have only ever really gone to magistrates court but I've got two cases going to crown court soon, but it's exceptionally hard and to answer your question, I actually have never fou never got anyone to go to prison yet. Alright? Yes? Do you er like are you one of those people like if you hear about a death Mhm? are you one of those people who go to the house of erm if a member of the family's dead? You mean like if say, terrible thing to say, if someone in the family dies, do you mean if I'm the person who goes and tells the relatives, the mum and dad or anything like, yeah Yeah. I've done that and that isn't very nice. I went, I had to tell a lady that her husband had died er about two Christmases ago, two days before Christmas. Her husband died in a car accident and I had to go and tell his wife. It must have been before, after my birthday then. Oh probably then. just before Christmas then. Yes? If erm a lady, if erm a wife is on fire and it was just a wife living in the house Mm? erm would erm if you'd known about it would erm you go and tell the firemen or would the firemen just find out Of course. theirselves? Of course,i er sometimes people phone up the Fire Brigade and the Fire Brigade get to the fire First. fire first, sometimes the police, if it's a really serious fire, get there first but the real professionals when it comes to a fire are the Fire Brigade. So if the lady was on fire, you'd leave it basically to the Fire Brigade, obviously if you could help the lady, get a ladder up to the window to get her out of the room or something like that, you would do that, you would help in any way you can, but the real experts are the Fire Brigade so we leave all the er real technical stuff to the Fire Brigade. My br erm my step-brother erm lived in a flat and, and the flat got on fire and they had to climb out the window and jump out Not very nice. Not very nice. and the lady catched him. Yeah? It's not very nice because everyone thinks a fire is flames but the really dangerous thing is smoke and you literally can't breathe in the smoke. I've been to a fire where there was a huge black cloud coming out of a, a flat That's what happened to me and it was and you couldn't get near it because the heat of the fire was so strong and the smell of the of the smoke was overpow you literally couldn't get near it and everyone had to come away. Yes? Well how do you know that someone's burgling something? How do you know that someone's burgled something. Sometimes they phone you up. Sometimes, yes. But you're talking about people who actually do it are you? Yeah. Right. Sometimes they leave their fingerprints there so they get what's known as the Scenes of Crime Officer or what they call like all po well like all forces But what if they've got gloves on? Difficult. There might be a, there might be a security camera there that catches them coming in. There might be a witness next door. There might be footprints. There might be footprints, there could be anything, several things and the all those type of things is what helps the police to try and catch the people Now what I was thinking was erm you know, what I wondered was, shall we do er a circular game and, get yourselves into a circle quickly Shh shh come on, quick now. because we always do a lo we always collects words in our classes Oh yeah? we're good at collected words Police words Shh shh. Right so that's what I thought, we could s collect some police words now, alright? And we've gotta go around and you have to think of one word to do with police until we stop until we run out of them. Oh I know one. Police Right. Okay? Right I'll just see who's looking smart to start. So I hope you've all thought of one word, right, if somebody else has said it before you you've gotta think quick and think of something else. Right? Who shall I start with? Som oh P C can choose. Mm mm mm mm mm you. Truncheon. Gun. Hat. the points we raised earlier is that there are, there are bits of information which we either assume or are missing so on that. Ron. Er yeah well all, all those things er and I thought the, the diagram was marvellous and you sort of to start with you, you were thinking ahead to doing this diagram and you could see that that's what you were waiting to do and then once you did it you were up and running. That is the diagram Yeah I know. Then you was up and running. And then it sort of you, you lost your track slightly with the referral side I know. At the very end I instead of sort of going over and saying what a marvellous job we did here er and then saying yeah fantastic It's alright she can't keep quiet Ron, we're not laughing at you. Oh sorry. Saying fantastic erm and then you can say look, as it's been of some benefit do you remember what I said earlier? Mm. You know because you, you sort of lost, she lost her track going in to that on how to get him back into the referrals. You know she went straight in for it without sort of seeing how well That's right. Anything else? No that's, that's, that's basically it and the other points that you've covered of course. But erm yeah, okay. Martin? Right yeah erm not much more to add really I sum er summary of needs, I think that's okay and you explored and probed quite well, the picture was good and all that, I could see where you were coming from. The two hundred pounds per week was in fact my misunderstanding, it's two hundreds pounds per month, just roughly fifty quid a week that's where I got it from. Erm but you're gonna come across some people who are cocksure of themselves Mm. who say well no you are wrong and not being condescending but so some men like that. Er I think you apack it appropriately and have sales aids with you. Mhm. And we do provide you with sales literature to say well actually strange to say but it has gone up recently it is only fifty eight pounds a week. And then that will just let me down ever so slightly, yeah? But you did come back and you had the, the figures to hand. Er but what I become, I thought you might become more confrontational but you didn't so so you dug a hole for yourself that you could've dug out of you sat in there but I think you handled that quite well, but there are people like me out there who think they know it all and will have a go at you. Erm didn't say you'll go back and work out a plan of attack for me or did you? I did actually say I was going to put a plan together for you and come back in two weeks but I mean The second point was that yes you mentioned it but it wasn't really arranged,. The first was a good attempt but yeah you missed misled or confused then there could be several others I felt you could've picked up that would be highlighting the second appointment that carried the whole process through Mhm. erm when you that you intend going back to plant the seed, how have you found today's been?some benefit etcetera etcetera etcetera and . But I thought good structure control overall, painted pictures well erm and I think perhaps just probe a bit more just a little bit stronger than you are at painting pictures but as you see a picture paints a thousand words. Mm. To try and explain that verbally would be very very hard Yeah it would. and you, you just, you can't mentally cross them off, keep a picture in your mind's eye of what you've crossed off. Yeah, so well done. And the fact that your wife is erm there was something that could've possibly been done for your wife and that is something that maybe I would've mentioned at the end, do you think this would of be any benefit to the wife only as maybe an ending statement or something Mhm. possibly. Maybe so, maybe so. Yeah well done. It's your turn now. Or have you said all you want to say? Erm I don't think there's much, I don't think there's that much more to say actually other than erm I, I didn't, I missed the erm the employee link completely I mean Yeah. I didn't, until Bill mentioned it I missed it completely. Mhm. Erm but er I think when you say about being confrontational there's if you've got a client in front of you the last thing that you want to do is have erm a confrontation with them Yes I agree with you. you know, you just want to sit back and er as far as I would think is to keep calm and say well I, I am right, you know, erm but without being too forceful in that way because then that would put them off Mm okay. so erm I don't er I wouldn't see the point in being too confrontational over an issue like that. Yeah. As long as I know that I'm right er and say well I'm quite willing to look at the figures that you've been given, but these are the figures that are right but I will look at them erm and I, and I certainly wouldn't er confront it much more than that. Right. I think I don't know whether that's right or not but well I'd go along with that but what I was saying was I, I thought you might become more confrontational and if you were then we'd've got into a bit of a tennis match there and but then you didn't go down that route, that's what I'm saying, you didn't actually go down that cos if you had've done we'd've got nowhere Yeah. cos I'd've got further and further and there's no way he was going to tell me I'm wrong. And you would've just dug the, the hole bigger and bigger wouldn't you? Yeah. Yes there's lots of us out there. Okay, well done. Any other comments, thoughts? Statutory sick pay income's State invalidity benefit that was the other thing That's right yeah. That's for twelve months int it? Twenty eight weeks. Well twe twenty eight weeks. Oh twenty eight weeks, yeah. That was the thing. Er is State, State invalidity benefit means tested as well? Yes it would be now yeah. Because the State er if he were covered for twenty six weeks full pay Yeah. that's aug augmented from his er It'll be paid to his company and his company will swallow that his company er so he doesn't really get that? Well I mean he gets it in he doesn't get it over and above his current mhm. but he may get it over and above after six months depending what Right. well after two weeks it becomes the statutory sick pay er then becomes the State invalid the State invalidity benefit. But the benefits are being reduced and our means tested and will get harder to pay out because of the furore recently erm fraudulent claims and we're a healthy nation but more people are claiming invalidity benefit. Er most people who claim invalidity benefit I mean don't need it anyway they're people who've got, you know, the existing bad backs, people Yes. like that and that's, I actually feel very strongly about that because I wouldn't mind paying more money if the people who needed it got it. I certainly wouldn't. But then the system's there to be abused and people abuse it. Well I know but it a it just annoys me. Yeah I agree. It just annoys me. What are we doing for time now, are we er on track, ahead of Five o'clock. We're about right I think aren't we? Yeah. Oh good. Yeah. Is this well it's Bill next. Well if it's Steve that's coming in, Steve interviewed me. It may well be Alan. Are you quite happy with that? Yeah I'm just no cos this, fortunately there's not four role play cycles to work through so yeah there may be somebody left again. Right. But what I wanna do is to, I'll get you all eventually. No I'm not, it's not, it's not bothering me No it doesn't bother me. Actually with the carpenter being self- employed and single Yeah. that is it Er no just say the same Right. Okay. Right because the other thing is er his age is important to me He's thirty five. thirty five, okay. Are you tired as well Martin? Yeah. I think everybody is. Sorry? I think everybody is. Yeah so imagine how you feel if you've got another two role plays to do and then try and concentrate for two hours again. Okay. Right. Six down two to go. How did the other group get on with their exams? Er two failed but I don't know who. Two out of there, oh. And one got seventy nine percent. Oh what out of the two? Er one of the two seventy five Mm. so he was quite gutted to miss it by one, maybe one well two, two questions. One or two, two questions anyway. Yeah. It's a bit sick is that. And he sees his feedback he'll kick himself Yeah. cos okay you won't believe he got several of those questions wrong as, you know, as we looked at the end of last night's, you can't believe No er the most annoying thing about last night was when, when Martin was actually reviewing erm some of the topics that we hadn't got right erm and Martin was prompting us with questions and we answered them! And you give the right answer. Yeah Yeah. Do we all get to see our papers again or You won't see the papers again but you'll get, I mean you shouldn't really see them I have No. I have to say because erm but you'll get technical feedback on the areas you've got wrong. Fr what, from the branch manager when we get back No from us er yesterday, well last night, well this morning rather, yesterday morning I faxed all the figures through to my head office figures this morning Right. they'll have rung all your branches and given the results Right. erm obviously the priority is to get the feedback to the people that have to resit the exam Yeah. and you may find that they've been done and they'll be posted to your branch so they will be there when you get back on Monday. and then take it from there. gonna be there Monday. No. We might, we might be Wednesday but Yeah whatever, whatever! They will come back to your branches So the feedback we get will be from From us. the branch yeah. I erm I hope I pass on Thursday because I've got two appointments on Wednesday. You will do. I know I will do but I've got t I've got a few appointments for next week. Have no fear you will pass. Have faith in your abilities. I was quite pleased when I got appointments between Christmas and New Year. Well you did well Did you get any appointments between Christmas and New Year? I've got my watch this time, Uncle Ron. Well done son. Oh sorry I'm falling short in my duties aren't I? You are yes. Right pensions isn't it? Yeah I'm afraid so. This is when I'll dry up but never mind, I'll try. We shall try. Is that, is that Billy's? It's Billy's. Good. It's Billy's and Bobby's and Bobby's and Billy's. I'm Billy he's Bobby, no I'm Bobby he's Billy . Is she alright? Eh? Right. Can't believe you've been watching all this television. Right tell me when you're ready. Roll. Roll. Don't want me er don't want me to just check it? Have you moved the chairs at all? Yeah, tell me when it's going. Are you going? That's fine. The mike, the mike it's too far away, there we go. Is that, is that comfortable? Are we cosy here? No we've, we've actually got Have you got a wide, have you got a wide angle job on that? The luck we're having with cameras you're lu it'd be wonderful if it's actually working. How we doing now? Yeah Good. Right. Yeah that's fine. Okay? Aha. Now you switch on then. Okay, are you, are you ready now Bill? Mm. Yes? Thanks very much for that information Mr Russell That's okay. We've now moved on to Just call me Steve, it's alright. Fine, right Steve, thank you very much. I'm Bill by the way. Okay Bill Right now you've told me you're self-employed as a carpenter, how long have you been running this business? Er about seven years now. Fine. Er what did you do previous to that? I was a bus driver. A bus driver. Did you have any preserved benefits from your previous employment? Sorry? Did you have a pen were you of pensionable salary Oh, oh yes. er as a bus driver? Yes I was, yes. That's good. Yes I had about ni I was there about nine years. Right so there's so something waiting for you, what we call preserved benefits sitting here er that's, that's good to know. You, you'll have details of that somewhere will you? Well I've got it somewhere, I mean Right. it'll take me an half an hour to go, do you want me to go and get it? No not just now, no that's alright, it was just er it's, it's important that you do have I've got it somewhere filed away. Right, that's grand. Now you've told me that er your net relevant earnings is twelve thousand pounds and your take home pay is seven hundred pounds. Mhm. What other source of in of income do you have? I haven't got any. None at all? No. So you're ploughing everything into the business at this moment That's right. in time and it's been going for about five years. Mhm. That's, that's er I w I'd like to come back er to that a little bit later. Have you made any pe er pension er provisions meantime? No none whatsoever. Okay er have you thought about it? I've thought about it but erm it's another one of those things I, I guess I keep putting off to the er a little bit later. Right. Sometimes it's a difficult thing to explain er why you should start early with a pension but very simply what, what would you be looking for when you retire? Two thirds salary? You'd like a hundred percent, obviously, or even more. Yeah I, well, hundred percent, why not? Right. Okay. Right so what you're looking for is twelve thousand pounds? Mhm. And if we draw a line it's the analogy of someone pedalling on a bicycle, if you reach thirty five and you're going up on a bicycle like that it's reasonably steep but not too steep, you can cope with that on a regular basis. If you wait five years it gets slightly steeper so the force to you becomes that and so on and so forth, forty five fifty and you can see at fifty five if you want to retire at a certain age er what's the age that you actually want to retire? Well sixty would be nice. Sixty right so if we do that at sixty we can see where that, where I'm coming from. Thirty five, you can cope with that on a reasonable basis, forty there, forty five, fifty and so on, how does that feel to you? Making er provision for a pension? I can see what you're driving at, I mean what you're saying is, you know, start it as soon as you can really. The sooner the better. There are two ways of doing that because in actual fact you could do this o over a period of thirty five to sixty which gives you twenty five years Mhm. if your business picks up, and hopefully it will Yeah. It's, it's looking good. then you'll be employing other people Yeah. that's good, there is what we call compressed funding. Now that's quite technical but what you can do, as you're making pro profits, you employ these profits in very very quickly Mhm. for a short period of time which will have the same affect of building it up over the twenty five year period and you can use the money for er er other things. I don't understand. I mean well can you explain that again? Right. Okay. Instead of taking it over a thirty five year period, what you would then have is that you go up very steeply let's say by putting lump sums or er regular capital premiums erm which you'll receive a tax refund and then it stops but the benefits of the fund keep going so at age sixty they would have the same effect of reaching your pension there with no contributions Surely that, that's not possible is it for, for people in my position because I'm putting all my money into the, into the company. I mean I I haven't got money left over to start whacking in money into a pension scheme. Fair comment. At this moment in time I would agree with you entirely. Mhm. Now that's, that's perfectly valid but if the business actually improves, it takes off, you could have this advantage to, to do it over a shorter period of time, maybe in ten years' time when business is really So should I wait there are there are alternatives Right. if you wait Shall I wait and then put in er would it be better for me to wait and then put in a big lump sum? That's the sixty four thousand dollar question because you've now lost ten years and the hill's getting a wee bit steeper again But isn't this com compressed funding as you call it gonna sort of taking it into, that into account? It would do because in actual fact that would obviate this particular steep hill. Right. Okay? But er you mentioned that there's er there's no er retirement er provision's been made Mhm. is that of great pri priority to you? Well your, your little diagram shows that I really yes ought to be doing something about it, yeah. Right, okay. Erm so if I could pu come up with a plan er to fund a pension and take this away and look at your particular situation over the twenty five year period, would you be quite happy to er look at that providing you're happy with the er the money, the sum in involved and all the rest of it? Yeah yeah well why don't you erm show me some er some proposals on that. Make some illustrations, right. Yeah I'd be happy to look at some illustrations. Okay. Well what I would like to do is obviously erm when would be convenient to come back and see you? Oh you want to come back? Well obviously I'll have to give you the illustrations. Oh. Couldn't you send it to me? Er I could do but then again would you under er so that you can understand er what the actual recommendations are, the important thing is again that we see you face to face. Well your recommendation's a pension isn't it? My recommendation would be a pension, yes that's right because that's your priority, you've chosen Sure. not I er Yeah. and what I want to do is to look at it er over that particular period so I can explain everything to you in full because there are benefits to you in terms of tax savings Sure. because that is important. Isn't that in don't you have any kind of er literature to to We can do. send me and I could read that. Yes er that, that's no problem but what I would like to do is obviously keep er face to face er contact so that we can explain the thing fully because you may have other questions that you want to ask once you've actually read it so therefore I'm on hand hopefully to answer all these questions Mhm. at that moment in time. Okay fair enough. Okay erm when would be convenient er to see you? Er next week's no good I'm, I'm really tied up at work, I've got lots of jobs on erm Good thing. yeah we, we're very busy That's good. I would say er say a fortnight's time. A fortnight's time at the same time, six thirty? Six thirty yeah. Er Wednesday evening? Mm. Fine I'll just take a note of that, thank you. Right. Now providing your happy with these recommendations er do you have to consult anyone else er Erm in order to do so? I think it might be wise for me to talk to the accountant before I, you know, put these plans into effect. Fine, that's no problem because at least you've got a fortnight in which to make contact with him and put your intentions up. Yeah. Well I, I'll wait till you bring back your, your er illustrations and then I'll talk to him. Right. Er are you happy with the way we've addressed your particular need today er namely the pension? Er yeah I mean a pension's a pension isn't it? So Yes. I don't need to worry about that. Erm what about er er if you're happy with that particular product erm we hope that you will understand if, sorry,er you're completely happy with the, the arrangement then you'll be happy to er go ahead with it er at, at our next meeting? Well as I say I, I'd like to run it past the accountant afterwards. Fine. Yeah good, and what amount er would you be happy to put into your pension. Well obviously as little as possible because At this moment in time. Well I mean I don't wanna put in er a great deal of money because most of it's ploughed back into the business. Right. Er have you set a sum Well what's your minimum? Erm twenty pounds. Er well twenty pounds sounds alright. Okay. Right. What I'll do for you deliberately er if the situation changes between now and a fortnight's time after you've sp spoken to your accountant, I'll probably look at twenty, thirty and forty just to give you an illustration of what the expectations er are by, by putting a sum in there. But again bear in mind they're only for illustration purposes only. Fine erm now you mentioned earlier that er you played er squash and tennis Mhm. can you think of an remember when I asked about introductions and things of that nature? Are any of your colleagues that you play er squash with or tennis with er in the same boat in terms of self employment Yeah there there's a number of them, yeah, there's a solicitor erm there's a chap who's set up his own business, his own erm antique restoration business. Good. Er could you give me the these names please? Er and the Yeah. telephone number? Yeah sure. There's er Jim Brown and er Fred Smith. Fine. Well I'll be contacting them in the next fortnight er if and to make be able to pass on my card, I'll leave you two cards so that they, they know to expect a phone call from myself. Mhm. That's grand. Erm thank you very much for your time,sociabilities and close. Okey-dokey. What number? Oh that was , that was the one What ? Cut. Ron do you wanna start? Yeah, sure. Erm Ooh! er er you were going, you were going well with the, the pension you, you wanted him and your diagram was good and he was going for it but directly you showed him the diagram then you started on about this er Compressed funding. compressed funding so you were giving him too much Ooh! yeah, at once. Now, now it would've been easier for you, the, the part that you missed out which would have brought all that in to play would have been how much do you want to pay, do you wanna pay a, a small amount over a long time or a big amount over a short time and then that would've brought that into play. And then there's the other diagram, the it's the hours of the day Yeah, that's right. So I mean you could've got round it but you know you was good what you were doing but that's where you lost yourself didn't you? Mhm. And, and er and that was that. Erm you also dug holes for yourself by sort of bunging some stuff in the post. Erm.. you know you should've nipped that in the bud straight away rather than saying yeah we'll put it in the post, we can do that, you should've just said you know well I'll bring it all along and gone from there. Erm also the accountant you could've tried to of got round because you were, you were digging the hole there erm you know where he's, okay he wants to see the accountant, will this be a good idea I mean you could've said yeah you know you appreciate that and all the rest of it and you could've gone more into the tax side of where you, you know, you could've perhaps er the company could've benefited by putting some into the pension scheme as opposed erm paying all the taxes maybe you could've gone in that way. Er and the only other point was, where was how much can you afford and he said well what's the minimum? And you said twenty quid and that was it I'll have one of those please. Yeah, you were finishing up erm that was it. You know you should've perhaps questioned him, you know what's his minimum what, you know, what could he how, how important is his future. You know it, it was good and that's, you know, and that's not knocking you apart at all No. and of course, you know, you er er you'll get hold of all this as the more we do erm but you lost your way on the diagram by giving him too much I think and, and er the referrals you sort of lost at one point but you come back and reclaimed it didn't you? Mm. Okay? Are you done? Yeah. Thank god. Joan? Okay. Can I just ask a question to start with because I was messing around with the camera and was it that he ha that he had no private pension policies at all? Haven't got any. Right okay so there was nothing to actually come back in and question about that cos there was, there was nothing that you actually came back and, and actually questioned on that, on that form. Okay. Well i it was just that I, I missed the initial question Mhm. so I wasn't quite sure of the answer that you gave back with me walking back from the camera so I just wanted to qualify that so that, I mean all that I noticed was that there was nothing that, that, no information that you tried to get out of him. I, I haven't got anything. Erm but anyway so that was that then. The summarizing of needs erm well the exploration of needs you, you never really went in to erm er what he really needed, what he thought he needed to retire on. What, what what er level of income that he thought he needed. You never actually found that out. Erm so, so really what er although when you came to summarize the needs I've actually put good but too technical because we all knew what you were getting at but erm but to actually be doing that but not know at what point he needs to stop at or wants to stop it, you didn't know erm the pension that he wanted and you didn't know at what age he wanted to retire at that point you know, you, you hadn't got any of those facts from him, you know Mm. so I actually felt that although that presentation was very good, it was almost like a blind presentation because there was no benefit to him at the end of it because he, he didn't have, you hadn't got those finishing point Aha. that's the way that I saw it. Erm I'm not quite sure about this, I may be wrong, but I thought that maybe that you could've erm questioned him a little bit more about why he thought he needed to speak to his accountant. Fair enough he may have had a very good reason for doing so but I thought that that would have been a typical apack erm he did say well you know I just want to run it by him, you know, just to make sure but you, you still needed to know why he thought that his accountant had to be involved. The referrals you, you missed the, the beginning out of the f referrals and just went straight into it and said have you got anybody I could contact Mhm. so erm but I think Robert's already mentioned that part of it. Erm and again I put erm things about putting details in the post although you, although you did try and overcome that one erm but you, you just couldn't, you couldn't get Steven to realize the benefit of you actually going round with the illustrations rather than you just sending it and you needed to get, to get the appointment out of him rather than because if he got the illustrations in the post he may never read them. So You find that is the reality. you know so erm so some er a lot more should've been done about actually getting, even if it was just well I'm in that area, I'm in the area on such and such a day anyway so I can call in to see you. Erm and erm again the last comment I've got is er how much was affordable to himself. But that would've tied in again with, with the beginning because what is affordable erm would he get the benefits that he was wanting at the end of it. That's it. Okay? Yes. Thanks Joan. Erm yeah I th I mean I, I've got more or less all the points that have been raised but I, I just felt that it went it er it was almost as though you'd made your mind up before you went in that you were gonna tell him what compressed funds was and by hell or high water it was gonna be on that . Mm. Erm We know that you know what compressed funding is Yeah . I, I mean the, the conversation started off and when, when you started to ask him about his existing or his previous pensionable employment as a carpenter he really hadn't got a clue as to what it was all about. Erm you, you never really sort of er he said he'd got a bit of paper somewhere and he could perhaps go and find it and you said, you know, sort of no not now erm but having done that you never, you never, not now erm but having done that you never, you never, I Mhm. and I think as a result of that it, it got disjointed and you, and you couldn't follow it through. Erm you, you did, you know, you did summarize with what you thought you, you'd established erm you went through to, to get your second appointment Steve threw, you know, the objection in about sending it in the post and what have you erm er and, and you o you overcame that erm successfully but I think the other thing that, that with, with the ANNA it, it unless you get that authority the rest of it is meaningless because you know you can't go on and, and, well you can agree the needs but there's no way that he's, he's gonna agree to do it now or when you go back or, or even perhaps agree on the amount. I think if you've got somebody who's got a er a solicitor or an accountant then you need to establish why he wants to talk to them and also er if he, if he's adamant that he wants to do that, find out who he is and ask if you can speak to him as well, or you can explain erm you know what the, what, what you're doing with the client. But don't sort of back away from them try and to, to work with them cos you've gotta, you've gotta get the two, the two together. Erm as I say really it was, it was just er er the same as er as the other people said. There was one, there was one last comment that I missed out there that it was the erm the permission to proceed with the product recommendations, you were wanting to proceed with recommendations but you hadn't got the commitment off Steven in the first place so you were suggestion recommendations and what! Because you, you hadn't got the commitment that he wanted a pension or he didn't I didn't, I didn't feel that at that point that you That and it, and it went back really to the fact he hadn't explored the needs. That's right yeah everything went back to that initial part. Yeah. Steve. Yeah now you see the, the difficulty with that particular one was I wasn't con convinced or committed to buying anything because you had not explored my needs Okay. you see, that's, that's the problem Mhm. and it's a case of er if you're talking to somebody about pension requirement it would be a case of Mr Prospect let's just have a look, let's imagine today is the last day that you'll be working as a carpenter. You pack your bags, shut the door, switch off the lights and you go home and you've got the, the r another thirty odd years perhaps to look forward to in retirement. What are you gonna be doing now that you're not working? How are you gonna be spending your time? Mm. What are you gonna be spending your money on? How are you gonna be occupying yourself? Mhm. If you'd retired yesterday how much money would you need in today's terms to spend? What would you be spending it on? Because you see there was none of that exploration and it's just those nice easy open question to get me to start enjoy spending my, my er retirement. Erm so I c I couldn't buy any of what you were telling me and it's all like a, it was all a smokescreen I was putting up, the accountant, basically I, I was not erm buying anything er and the compressed funding was just blowing my mind because I couldn't understa er it was basically giving me an easy option to say I don't need to do anything cos I can compress my funding at forty five won't I, when my business has taken off. It was like you know, you were digging a hole and er it was, it was making it very difficult for me to want to buy you see? Mhm. And then when I gave you the minimum premium er it was like right okay well that's, that's the easy way out isn't it, twenty quid a month, okay I might do something for twenty quid because I wasn't committed and that's what exploration of needs is all about and it's, it's so easy for me to sit and say yeah that's what you need to do but putting myself in your shoes, you know, a few years ago Mhm. how to do it Mm. and that's what, you know, I try and help you on if you like but how can you do that when I saw a, a very good erm presentation of a pen of pensions. Erm it was actually somebody who came for an interview and you know how you sit in on the presentations when you do the group presentations? And erm he actually, he, he started off and, and was very nervous but the summing up of it was, was brilliant erm and I, I wouldn't put it across as well as what he did but the principle of it was that he, he suddenly turned round and said right I have now changed my job, right, you are now looking at the new managing director of Friends Provident, he says, and the first thing I am going to do is I'm cutting all your wages to eighty five pounds a week, what are you going to do about it? And that was it and erm so then everybody's saying so, you know, I'll come banging on your door and saying what do you think you're doing, you know, knocking me down to eighty five pounds a week or, or whatever it is and, you know, obviously there were various feedbacks from that and then the summing up of it was, so is that what you're going to do to the D S S when you, when you retire? Obviously he put it across a lot better than what I did but the actual message of getting that across to Mm. because, you know, especially to people, and this is this is not talking down to people but er to somebody who doesn't understand pensions or anything who I'm a carpenter I'm not a rocket scientist either, yeah. That's it you have to put it in the simplest of terms and that is the way that most people would understand it, you know, you come to sixty five or whatever and instead of having three hundred pounds a week you've got eighty five pounds a week and what are you going to do about it. And I thought that was that was one of the best, simple erm ways of actually describing what a pension Mhm. of what to do to actually your pension in retirement. Anyway I just thought it And very, yeah, I mean th that's, that's all that this exploration of needs is, is just saying you retired yesterday and you were earning twelve thousand a year, you're now gonna be earning two and a half thousand pounds a year. What's gonna go? What, what things have you still gotta pay for, what things are you gonna cut out a bit? Come on, let's write them down. Food? Well you still want food, rent, mortgage do you wanna have a holiday, are you gonna run a car? Meals out well you're not gonna do it on two hundred and fifty pounds erm a month or whatever it is, you can't do it can you? What are you gonna cut out? Do you want that to happen? You don't. Do you wanna do something about it? Mm. So in fairness I got this, excuse the expression, arse about face in the sense that I ha I thought prioritize these and pensions were, was this and that's why you were exploring the needs for the second appointment. You know you had gone through the whole C C Q and the priority was the pension, that's what I got wrong. What I should've realized was that we're still filling in the form Yeah that's exactly it. and that's, that's, that's why I went totally off beam Steve. The reason I asked for a preserved pension obviously to see whether there was any preserved benefits. The second thing was I asked, and nobody picked it up, five, five years he'd been working could the net earnings related carry forward? Oh yeah. So I mean again I realized I had dug a hole for myself with the compressed funding but at the same time I was saying to myself oh yeah there is carry forward here er Mm. there was a possibility, still , there was still something there that we can use. Erm I'm, I admit er that that was one I just bolted simply because I was taking it the wrong way round, I thought we had identified what was the priority, life insurance, P H I and pensions and was summarizing it whereas I should've realized we're doing that page towards the priority Mm. there's a totally different way of doing it. You see about the accountant, you've gotta knock that on the head immediately because otherwise it's a waste of space. Yeah that's right. You've gotta destroy it. But the accountant could well be the guy that you went and played tennis with and the boy doesn't even make a move unless he gets the accountant and So it's a difficult one to get over on occasions. well you've gotta probe, you've gotta, you've got to apack that Yeah. say that's interesting you want to speak to your accountant Mhm. why? Yeah. Because the then again I was er at the back of the form and I knew who his accountant was er You've gotta probe and establish the reasons why I'm gonna talk to him and most people it's, it's, it's a lie, they're not gonna talk to him, they want to use the accountant as a reason to say oh erm I'm, I can't do it this time the accountant said no or I've not spoken to him yet I'll have to put it off for a, for a bit longer Mhm. so you've, you've gotta knock that one out. Mhm. Er and as for budgets erm you know I'd, I'd be saying to people come on you're not buying a raffle ticket, let's talk serious funding. How serious are you about being able to retire with some dignity and being able to continue doing the things you've always wanted to er the things you've been able to enjoy doing but you'll have to give up. Are you serious about doing this? That's right. You know you could put in up to seventeen and a half percent, that represents you know That's right. a hundred and fifty pounds, how close can you get to a hundred and fifty pounds a month? t having done that you never, you never, I6 I think, I think the other thing is as well though is that when you, I mean you've been sitting pensions cos I mean I had the P H I which I thought it was easier to actually describe erm but erm it's easy for us to actually sit back and, and go back on everything that everyth er everybody else did wrong isn't it, so Sometimes er trying to sell a pension to a thirty five year old can be difficult cos he's not interested, he's, he's only interested in his job Oh I don't know I think and his business. It's your job to make him interested. Now that's, no fair comment, I take the point fully er I'm just saying, you know, that you've got a thirty five year old, och why the hell do I need a pension. When I I I think the thing is if, if you'd've demonstrated that or, or got to the stage of saying well alright, you know, if you're retiring tomorrow how much money do you need to, to live on I should've painted the picture then if you'd've done your bike riding up the hill Yeah. I think, you know, you, you were going down the right track, you've gotta be really. That would've been down hill. Mm well. I I think a good example to use with younger people with er pe with pensions as well is that the, the er the cutting down of funding that the government is making and it's going to be hitting like the younger people and another important thing is like with the, with the Australia issue, I mean in Australia now it's compulsory for everybody under the age of twenty five to have a personal pension and that r and that age rise is going to, that age limit is going to rise each time because they want to abolish the State pension completely and it was only, what, what about two months ago that there was, that there was er articles in I think it was The Times about them doing a similar operation in this country, you know? Mm yeah that was in all the national press. Yeah so I mean with, with younger people it's, although th they're still not, it's still not going to be easy-easy er like with the older people, there's still the, the disturbance element that in years to come they are not going to have this to fall back on because by the time that they retire it's just not going to exist. You know? Yeah that's fair comment, I But I think I think the Australian one is, is er quite a good example to use on pensions. Yes it is. Yeah. Well and, and the press comments th that have been made here, you know, that you could end up What did Peter Lilley say the other day, you know, that er you'll have to provide thinking about. provide for yourself won't you? That's it, yeah. Yeah. And er I mean th the o the question you would use for, for this one is tell me, what are your thou what is it, what are your thoughts on pensions, you know, what are your thoughts on retirement, how do you feel about it just open up for the guy to say it's very important or I'm not interested, oh that's interesting why do you say that. Yeah er if he retired tomorrow. And it's, no if you'd retired yesterday, it's always retired yesterday, you died yesterday Yesterday. Why, why's that? Because well it Today is reality int it? Yeah. well if you say, if you'd re if you died yesterday er tomorrow Yeah. well I can't die tomorrow cos I've got a very important meeting and er and er I say it's, you've always gotta go back last night, last week Yeah and what you can say what would happen cos it's gone and you're not It's gone frightening them er you're not erm you're not saying you're gonna die tomorrow or next week. Yeah you w you would be saying, if there's a husband and wife there and you said you died yesterday and if the, if the husband butts in you say you're dead, you say nothing, all the plans you're gonna do you never did, right, so you're dead, you keep quiet you can't go back and have a reincarnation. Thank you. Oh it's a bit strong actually isn't it? Talking of reincarnation Maggie's come back. Did you give me yours? Yes there, I put it over there. Mine's just on there Bill. It's just on that chair. Oh I think I've changed jobs again but I'm sti I'm still male. but that was good. You know you dug a hole don't you? I know a dug a hole and I totally misread it in the sense that That's a good idea but I don't think I'd No you know the priority was either P H I, savings or whatever and I thought we've gone through the whole form That's right. what the hell am I back here for Yeah. and instead of that if I'd've realized that exactly what the guys said you know Excuse me. Right who've I got and Me. what we doing? Erm savings. Cambridge? Yes. Right so it's Er what we got? Five, fifteen, thirty five minutes six twenty, oh we've still got bags of time then. You've got four minutes. Okay, erm er erm Right so erm I'm a chartered accountant on thirty grand. Oh you're gonna be the customer are you? Yes. Well the last time I was a chippie on twelve grand. Oh I don't know about that guv . Might as well get into erm the mode. Mhm. That's all you've done isn't it? Yeah. I didn't sleep very well Funny enough I'm tired last night actually and it didn't exactly help, well, it's a long trip up here, longer than I expected and I didn't Where where do you have to come from? Essex, Chelmsford. Oh right, I come from Halstead. Oh you're not far then. No. Just that bit further Oh you're, you're that bit further, well I suppose I'm that bit further really Well no you're further north aren't you? Which way because I did you come? Well I had to come down, I had to come, I erm went down to Bishop's Stortford and in fact What to pick up the M, A one M? Well I slightly lost myself because I went down the M eleven Why back up on the er the four one four so I was really doubling up my journey. Oh God you were weren't you? Cos I went That's right. straight on the four one four from Chelmsford, picked up the M eleven followed the M eleven up and took the A forty five across country. That's right. But I, I I'd've been quicker if I'd gone down into Brentwood, picked up the M twenty five and gone on the A one M That's right. Well er anyway as it, as it worked out, although I did a lot of s sloshing about, erm when I actually got to erm on to the four one four and I followed that through to the M one and straight up and I was running parallel with the M twenty five, virtually Yeah. it's just that all I heard all morning was there's so many delays there with all the water, surface water erm so I thought well let's try and avoid that. What time did you have to be here yesterday? Erm t erm two o'clock One o'clock. start, one o'clock lunch One o'clock for lunch yesterday. yeah. I mean it only took me two hours two and, two two and a half hours er I still can't get over the fact they cancelled my, my booking for last night. Don't know whether they thought I was gonna leave home at half past five this morning. Well that's alright Joan, Joan had an eight hour car journey to get to Nine hours. Yes cos you've got a long way Nine hours to come haven't you? I, I came very close to having a very bad accident because we didn't, we were up early in the morning and we didn't Mm. finish until late and then I had Mm ? Erm I know Oh it's all over here I moved them all Yeah there's one here, here are here are. No that's Oh it's okay hang on, no so no sorry. Erm do they have a plane? I th er erm It's a heck of a drive. Well it's pretty intensive. I mean there's a lot crowded into the time. Well this is about, I mean at this point it's about one o'clock in the morning. You'd've been better off to have been booked in here for a good night's sleep and then driven up the next day but then you're virtually sort of getting up there turning round and coming back aren't you? Well that's it cos I'd, I mean I had the accident, well I mean I, I didn't hurt myself and I was very lucky I didn't hit the cars but erm it was bad enough with er and I ended up on this big grass embankment at the end of the bypass. You know at the top it was like sloping down here and the car's like this and I'm having to try and get the car back down without it toppling over and it was an abs Where were you? I was on the erm bypass at this point about erm less than an hour from home Yes but that's when your concentration flags. Possibly yeah. You get more accidents within the fifty miles of your home than anywhere else. Yeah. Yeah. So that was quite well very fri That woke you up with a bang. very frightening. You alright? Yeah I was alright but I was very shaking and, and everything and I managed to get the car down and and there wasn't that many cars No other vehicles involved? No, no I, I don't know how but there was two cars that was, that was er behind me and I managed to avoid them but I don't know how. Did they stop? No. They just left you to it? So you had, you, you had to get it all down, you know, do everything by yourself? but when I got the car back on to the road, I mean I'm a, a complete bag of nerves and I'm, I'm not wanting to be walking along the, the edge of the bypass at one o'clock in the morning That's right. and erm the car's all over the place because the wheels are all covered in mud and everything so Joan for what it's worth erm and this is just something you might want to think about a mobile is worth its weight in gold. Yeah well my husband's talking about getting one of those because I mean after I didn't tell him all the details I was gonna say have you told your husband. Well I told him that, that I was getting very tired but he would've just worried about me coming back down you know I know. and I mean I've got s it's not as bad going back from here cos it'll only be about a six hour then. Not the point though is it? But erm and I, I thought well he's just going to worry unnecessarily so I'll tell him when I'm back Do have the mobile though because apart from everything else erm I mean you've got R A C membership Well we haven't though, not after twelve months. That's what we were told in the branch, it lapses after twelve months Well I've still got the R A C membership card. Yeah it's only No for the guarantee er the one year warranty I think you'll find Maggie. I haven't been told that. I think you'll find it is. Cos I asked about that before I travelled down because I was worried in, you know, in case of breaking down. A lot of Well as far as I'm aware we've got R A C membership because I've got the card, nobody told me to Er has the card been filled in with a date on it? Cos I've got one in my car that's over two years old and there's not a, you know nobody's written anything on it or anything. As far as I'm aware it's standard R A C membership. It's something Yeah go on Will Not, not to be s unsympathetic but I mean let's try and get this in to press on. thirty five minutes. One two Are you ready Rob? Yeah. I'll erm I'll just check this because we've changed round again and last time that Oh yeah. Well it should be okay. Yeah? Yeah Robert can you just move in s every so slightly, that's better. That's fine. Ooh! Sorry I'm only playing. Do you think I'd make a good do you think I'd make a good director? Cut excellent. Right thanks for that Maggie. Er I'd just like to move on now erm what future capital needs do you need anticipate? Sorry I'm not, not with you. Okay. Er for your future, is there anything that you feel may come up erm that you will need er a lump sum of money for? Er your children's future, your future? Your plans for ten years or so? Oh I see what you mean er I didn't quite understand what you were talking about. I'm sorry. Erm well as it happens it's er that, this is something I wanted to bring up with you. Erm when I got married erm I had a, a, a lump sum of money and erm I was thinking about my daughter about putting some money on one side. Right and what, what would for what reason would that be? Well so that she has similar, so that she has erm you know money when she gets married or if she decides not to get married maybe she can use it for a, a house deposit. Mm. So you're looking for mm well if she's ten at the moment you're looking at ten years plus I suppose. Mhm about ten eleven years, yes. Yeah sure. Okay. Pen's run out right okay so you're looking for er a savings plan or a l a lump sum of money for ten years plus for your daughter? Yeah but erm but I'd like to have some sort of life cover with that so if anything does happen to me she gets Mm. a lump sum. Sure. Okay. Er what about your son he's only eight he Ah well actually he's provided for because there is a sum of money left in trust for him so it does just my daughter I wanted to Ah right so it's really just your daughter that your looking er for a lump sum Well yes having said ten years yeah but having said that erm that was something I wanted to ask you about because I mean both, both of them might need some money for higher education so, whilst I'd like to put that sum money on one side, I'd also possibly, you know if the need arose, would like to use it myself if I needed to for, for higher education. I want it to be fairly flexible. Sure. So really you're, you're, you, you would prefer it to be under your name Mhm. and then if you needed it for the further education you could use it Mm. if you wanted it more for, as a gift in ten, eleven years time as you've said Mm. erm you would then like just to get the lump sum and say here you are. Well I wanna make sure that if anything happens to me erm before the end of the policy that my daughter gets the money because Sure. as I said my son's taken care of from that point Sure. of view but I'd like to have access to it erm to Right. to be able to use it, I don't know if that I mean can you i is that something that's possible? Yes that, that is very possible cos what we could actually do is erm we could, we could put it under your life and then we could put it into a trust, a flexible trust. Now what that actually means is that the money er will go to your daughter if anything happened to you you know, at all varying ages the average age is fifty. But the most interesting thing about it is that i the actual level oestrogen bears no relationship to your symptoms as er Sheila has said, you can have two women with the sa exactly the same level of oestrogen and one woman is having awful problems and the other woman is, as we have heard, having no problems at all! A year I had all the symptoms and I went and got a book and read about it and tried to find out as much possible about it and the book scared me silly because it told me all these things that could happen Oh yes! and I was upset so I went to my doctor who's a lady doctor and she's young, she explained things to me and she put me on H R T and it changed my life completely! It th , I was depressed, I had swe sweats, night sweats and my husband was all , he couldn't sleep at night and it changed it completely! And, the worse thing for me was I lost my self confidence, I had no confidence whatsoever.,. in all areas, work-wise Mm. at home with my family, whenever I went on the H R T everything changed! I felt better, I looked better, I di I didn't feel, my skin was better, my hair come back, it was just marvellous for me! Absolutely marvellous! H R T Well women don't want to Le let Louise say! May I just say, I thi , I think it's important to point out that H R T isn't a miracle cure! And although it will grea , greatly help some women, unfortunately some women are unable to tolerate it, the side effects it gi , it gives them are worse than the actually symptoms they're having in the first place. It means having periods back again which after, and now, er several years break and erm, many women find unacceptable. We all have to have that. You don't have that? We do have, we ha , we have tablets for that. Yes? Over here! I must admit, after I'd finished with the menopause I felt absolutely great! I wasn't on H R T, I had a very easy transition from having periods to stopping having periods. Er, I did go on H R T because of the osteoporosis risk, but I was unlucky I was one of the I think twelve percent who had developed breast trouble and had to come off it. I think that er it is probably a very useful thing if you can tolerate it. But I must admit, having a lifetime of painful periods and not having any more painful periods was absolute bliss! And that's one of the drawbacks of H R T, it all came back again ! Down here. Yeah? I was just going to mention the fact that if you have had breast cancer you cannot go on H R T cos it was a hormone that caused it in the first place! Is that right. Yes. I think, one fact that probably, I'm sure yo , many of us know here is that the actual number of women on the H R T is really very small in this country! It's probably less, about, between five and ten percent! Mm. So I mean th the instance of breast cancer is rising the instance of breast cancer, the number of cases of breast is rising, it rises with age. Currently,th nu , H R T in this country will not be influencing the risks of breast cancer. On the other hand, and it is extremely complex and it indeed, it probably erm amounts to the fact that each wom woman has to consider how she feels herself Mhm. about whether she would wish to run the risks of A, B, and C. And the other condition we haven't mentioned is er th th th the risks of coronary artery disease and strokes which actually do, are the main cause of death o , in Scottish women! And it's it's almost like saying that the, if you take H R T er, this is in our sort of survey that you will in fact erm, reduce the instance of heart disease but ma , might you, in in fact, increase the risks of breast cancer. Your making it sound like a heads you lose, tails you lose situation! It's a, it's a very, very complex issue! I mean And un unfor , and this is in fact is why indeed, general practitioners and even specialists find it very complex! I mean, last month er And and, and that is you, I mean you are a consultant gynaecologist and That's right! And you're describing the complexity of it. Yes! If we're, if we're agreeing that women ought to be able to make informed choices, there's so much information it's actually very hard to make a, particularly if your Yeah. G P isn't as up-to-date as as as you might hope with the information him or herself. Yes! I sailed through the menopause, but then had lots of back problems. And this was cracked fracture from osteoporosis now, if I had been getting H R T at that time I might have been less disfigured. But, at least I'm on it now and hopefully, slowing down the osteoporosis and I don't care about the cancer, er scares! I'd rather la , have the treatment and ha , and have a reasonable life. Yes? As a younger and have plenty of time to worry about the menopause before it happens erm, all I can say is I'm glad to see that it's stopped being referred to as women's troubles, you know and we're actually bringing it out to the forefront. But, is there anything that my generation could do now that might stop us requiring H R T in the future? Alright. Mhm. I I think it's important, especially for for young women up to the age of about thirty five when your peak bone density is probably attained and after that you, you do go downhill, to maximise the calcium intake. Nowadays people are worried about er, drinking milk and dairy products because of the cholesterol bit, but I think that we've got to remember that there's a lot of calcium in milk and you should drink milk and take plenty of exercise and that is the time when it's probably extremely important! Yes? Wha , what do you do if you're allergic milk? Cos I haven't drink milk from, since a baby and Well tha , that's a bit more difficult. There are other foods that you can get it from, such as ice Erm cream, sardines Yoghurt? yoghurt. No,co oh well you'll be allergic to that too. I'm allergic, I'm allergic to a lot of foods! Can I, I want to pick up er, something that that Margaret said which is, I've got lots of time to worry about it. Now, obviously, you know,yo getting the menopause out into the open so that everyone can talk about it, exchange information that that it's not seen as a as a taboo or something to be particularly fearful of by men or women isn't going to be much good if it just makes everybody worry for er, for for the first half of o o o of their lives and, and then gibber through the second half! I mean, there is an argument,ha and it's been put by er a a noted writed who's recently written on the menopause that,work, and you should just make the most of being a crone or a hag or an old women! No! Now , I'm not saying I se , but it's a view that has been put forward,wha wha what do you think of that? Yes? I wouldn't actually say that you know, one has got to suffer unduly, but I think we do have to be very, very careful that we don't just play into the hands of the drug manufacturers! See, they've got most women hooked on, on er contraceptive pill for all their reproductive life and they're dead keen that we should all get so worried about menopause that we would also be buying their products until we die! Now, although I have great respect for er, the representative of the Osteoporosis Society I se , I still think as a epidemiologist that there haven't been enough women on H R T for long enough Mhm. for us to prove one way or the other that that, that that they co , the advantages out weigh the disadvantages. So you think we have some guinea pigs here? You have to be cautious! How long do you want them to be on H R T for? We've been following a group through in Glasgow who've been H, on H R T now for twenty three years! Up there. I think if you went and saw our own doctors a lot of our fears would be allayed because most of the young doctors wouldn't, would recommend to you, my own doctor asked me all the questions and different things and then he says he's a young doctor, he says if I were a women and if I'd answered all the questions as you did, I would go on H R T. So, there might be a lot of doctors who would do. Right. Beside you? Yes. Yes? I think you really highlights on working alongside with your doctor. I think you'll be able to read up as much information as possible and see a doctor and consult and especially th where women's clinic are, a great boom! And we should attend Mm. it more often. Up there. I would just like to say that erm, it's not all gloom and doom! Mm. The menopause isn't necessarily the end of our life, it can be the beginning of so many new different things. Yes? I I think erm, that it can be looked at to, without H R T or looking at it medically, because lots of the women at Dean Terrace, in fact have That's a family planning er problem That's right! situation. Yep! but erm, have erm problems with what this lady has described who can't come to terms with Mhm. the er loss of their fertility and the loss of their children and, have sexual problems and problems like that, and they don't necessarily need H R T they need lots of time, which they're given. And I think that helps them an awful lot! Is it impossible that your sex life might improve after the menopause? I mean I I wo er would anything like to say anything about Do we have to? No! a friend's experience or anything like that? Nelly? Yes I would like to say, it was smashing after the because you didn't have to worry that you were gonna have another child! So, though I had a bad time, well I had a, I've had a great life since! Good! Up there? What do you do about er, a doctor who says no? I mean, do you change your doctor or what? Yes. Who would like to answer that one? Yes? Get more information first, so that you know all your facts and if you ask us we'll send him a booklet without saying who er, who asked us to send it and then go in and see him and say, now the Osteoporosis Society have said this and it's a very brave doctor who will then say absolutely no! I'm, I'm not listening to you! But, in the final analysis, if you can't get any help, if he won't refer you to a specialist for help change your doctor! Because if the garage did your car badly you wouldn't have any hesitation in in changing your garage and your body's a darn sight more important than your car! I think women can sail into a beautiful old age with enthusiasm for hobbies, taking up new interests of all sorts and I've taken up skiing after the age of fifty and I'm, I feel I'm getting on well with it and this fresh air and and you know, getting out and finding who you really are after, you know, looking after children is is a wonderful thing! And this will keep you young! I don't have H R T, I didn't have any problems luckily, with the menopause but I feel I've I've found a bit more of who I really am, you know! I'm very interested in that because that is what Germaine Greer says in her book, it's only after the menopause that you have the freedom and the liberty, to find out Yes! Yes it who you really are! Does Exactly! does does does anybody, yes! Yes. Well I had a hysterectomy when I was forty nine and to me life really did begin at fifty! I go dancing! I'm now sixty two and I go dancing twice a week! So, I mean apart from arthritis life's quite good! Here. Can I say, I'm thirty six and had a hysterectomy a year ago. Mhm. I'm taking flushes and whatever but I feel brand new compared to what I felt before I had a hysterectomy cos I was totally lifeless! And I can agree with the ladies that say life begins once you get by all these problems that you had before. Up there. As a younger person I, I would expect that I've probably got another fifteen years to go to the menopause, but I'm looking forward to it as a relief from pre-menstrual syndrome! And, I wondering if any of the experts can say if there's erm a link between the severity of menopausal symptoms and pre-menstrual symptoms? Okay a final, final expert view on that. Who would like to offer a fortunately no. Yo erm your er it isn't your fate in life to have all this pro , though major problems erm, and I think P M S is a major problem. And, in fact er I would hopeful that you will be feel better. Yes. Mm. I have a question to the politicians. The N H S cannot cope in the moment with you know, regular sort of cervical cancer smears. Mhm. How can they cope in the future with sort of er monitoring the effects of H R T? Well er, that's for politicians watching, think about it to care about! Yes? Well if er, more women do take hormone replacement therapy and we cut the osteoporosis we will in fact have far money in the health service besi , because it costs a hundred and eighty million pounds a year to treat hip fractures alone at the moment! Germaine Greer has coined a term which you may have read, which is er which is called PM zed! Or PM zee, I suppose in America which she terms post-menopausal zest! Is post menopausal zest something that er every woman could look forward to if she gets the right advice, the right Definitely! treatment? Yes,! I think this being an old hag is what is all in the mind! If you're determined to enjoy the rest of your life you will! Be positive! Be positive about it, yes! I don't agree with that Sheena! No! You only have to listen to what women here have told you and it's not psychological! It's a myth! It is physiological! And there are plenty of people who have spoken here tonight have substantiated that! Mhm. , my first years had two children, had no breast problems and I'm having a horrendous time just now and I'm on H R T, I'm on my third different kind! And I've had so , examinations and my doctor is very good! Do , the doctor I have now is very good and very sympathetic! But she feels there's nothing you actually can do to help me with! Final word? As I've said, I've been on H R T for three years and, I have since went back to work after being on H R T I don't think I'm an old hag! I don't want to be like a film star, but I do want a better quality of life and I've got that with H R T! We're going to have to end and I'm sorry about that because er, it's been very interesting! You've heard a very broad range of views, erm, of all sorts! I think the most important thing that we've done is talk about it. Ninety one people here wanted more information. There is information available. I hope you can find it, er if yo if er if you want and and the important thing is to keep talking about it, keep exchanging information. Thanks everybody here for your experiences and information! Goodbye! Somebody once said that if angelism, sharing the gospel was one beggar telling another beggar about bread, where it could be found and undoubtedly when he was saying that he was thinking of that story that account that we had read to us earlier from the second book of kings, chapter seven, and I'd like us to er turn back to us for a few moments this morning and perhaps draw some lessons for ourselves Sometimes as Christians its very easier for us to say what sins are, and we can see other people's failings, you don't have to be a Christian to do that of course, plenty of other people can do that, they see the failings of other people, they see the wrong doing they do, they see their wickedness their, their waywardness, whatever words we want to use to describe it, and we say well that is sin, perhaps for most of us this morning we could make er a list a, a, a tabulate a table of sins and we might say well they are worse sins and there are lesser sins and I would I suppose by and large there would be a fairly reasonable consensus of opinion regarding what was sins and what were not sins. Sometimes the bible surprises us a little bit of course, and it puts it finger on things that we perhaps don't really want to talk about or we don't even consider as sins and the bible is quite clear that not all sins are what we do often there what we don't do in parable that Jesus told concerning the traveller, the man who went down to Jericho, we don't condemn the priest and the levite for what they did, but we do condemn them for what they didn't do, their sin was not what they did, it was what they left undone, going over and looking at the man was very note worthy, as least there was some interest there and we don't condemn them for that, but we do condemn them for hurrying along and not reaching out and helping the man in the Pistol of James and chapter four and verse seventeen James says there, any one then who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it, sins so the sins that you and I comment or the sins rather that we are guilty of are not just the things that we do there of times the things that we don't do and sometimes there more difficult for us to put a finger on, we can justify them so very easily its been said that all it needs for evil to triumph, is for good men to say or to do nothing well lets look at the, that,illu illustration there that we have in the second book of kings. As I mentioned early the, the city of Sermaria it was under siege and the army of Seria was encamped all around it, Ben Hadad was a great warrior, he would of been the, the Alexander or the Napoleon of his day and he had set up this encampment around the city of Sermaria, nobody could get in, nobody could get out and very quickly the stocks of food and water er were used up, rationing would of been introduced but it only lasted for a certain period, they'd got to the stage it tells us in the previous chapter that er, that a donkeys head was sold for eighty shekel's of silver and some folk had even got to the, had sunk to the level of cannibalism, of eating their own children and the city was, when they heard about this they were in an uproar and they started blaming god and in between the city of Sermaria of all its suffering and hopelessness and helplessness and the army encamped about with all of their supplies, there was this area of no mans land in which they were caught up four men who were leapers and they were trapped there, they didn't want to go over to the Serians because they'd be killed, they didn't want to go back into the city because they weren't allowed there and any way what was the point, they'd only die of starvation in there and so these four men are caught up in no man's land and yet their no better off than people in the city, now god had promised deliverance, through his serve and Eliger he had promised deliverance, Eliger said tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour shall be sold for a se shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Semaria, he said the gates are gonna be open, there's gonna be food and its gonna be a reasonable price and it says the royal officer who's hand the king was leaning on said the man of god said behold, if the lord shall make windows in heaven could such a thing be, he said don't talk stupid man, how can such a thing happen for us?, he didn't believe what god servant said and Eliger brings out to him a terrible judgment, he says because of your unbelief you will see it, but your not participate in it but lets look at these four men for a moment, cos that's where our real interest lies this morning, I just wanted to say three things in their experience, the first things is that they were amazed that, at what they found, because after they come together and they talk about it and they said well what shall we do and they weighed the pro's and the cons and Semaria doesn't look very attractive with its cannibalism, they said well the least if we stay here were gonna die, if we go into Semaria we'll die, lets go down to the Serein camp, the worse they can do to us is put us to death and were dying men any way, but they may just take pity on us, we maybe allowed to grope around in their dustbins and get some scraps of food, they may at least allow us that, and so they make their way down just as evening is falling, they make their way down to the Serein lines and when they get there, they are amazed at what they find, you see their condition was helpless and hopeless, they were dying men any way, they were lepers, but they were dying of starvation, that was far more imminent than their leprosy, their problems and their needs were greater than themselves, they could not meet their own needs, their problems and their needs were greater than their government, the king in Semaria and all of his court could not meet the needs of his people and then in verse five, we read something there, they arose at twilight to go to the camp of Aramians or the Serein's and when they came to the outskirts of the camp of the Serein's behold there was no one there, they expected to at least meet a guard, there would surely be somebody on sentry duty even if the rest of the soldiers had gone in to their tents and were perhaps getting ready for their, for the evening, going to bed or whatever they were gonna be doing, having their evening meal, there would at least be somebody on guard duty, but when they got there, there was no one there, god had stepped in, god had intervened and the good news of the Christian gospel is that god has intervened in our, in the midst of our helplessness, in the midst of our hopelessness, god has intervened, he had stepped in to history, so often you'll hear folks say, well why doesn't god do something, why does god allow this to happen, why does god allow that one, why doesn't he do something all they really show by that comment is their own ignorance, because god has done something, god has intervened, listen to what it says in John three sixteen, for god so loved the world that he gave, he's only son and the er, the er apostle Paul and he's writing to the Gallations, in chapter four and in verses four and five hear what he says there,but when the time had fully come god sent his son, born of a woman, born under law to redeem those under law that we might receive the full rights of son, er of sons , god has done something, he's sent his son Jesus Christ into this world in fact his done the greatest thing he could do, he has done the very ultimate thing, he has sent his son into the world that's the greatest intervention god could ever have made, it was far greater than, than just intervening in sm , in some small local event, were you see some catastrophe happening and you say well why doesn't god do something there, or there's a war situation going on in some other part of the world, well why doesn't god step in and stop it, god has stepped in, not in a local situation, not in some er passing problem or need but he's stepped into the greatest way possible by sending his son Jesus Christ into the world to dye for men and woman, to take away sin, to pay the price that god's righteousness demands for sin so god has intervened and his intervention has changed the whole situation, its brought a whole new complexion on things, its changed the colour completely, no longer is the world now under darkness and in, and in pending judgment in doom, because Jesus Christ came and he took that judgment and that, that condemnation upon himself, he said I've not come to condemn the world he said its already condemned, its already under judgement, the sword of Damocles is already hanging over the world and Jesus Christ came in and to take that judgment and that condemnation on himself and when he died there on the cross and rose again, there came that burst of light in a world that had been shrouded in blackness and darkness, a world that had been shrouded in sin suddenly for the first time sees the light, god has paid for himself the price of sin, god has intervened and changed the whole situation and the message of the gospel is that if you and I allow that intervention to effect us personally, then like those four men surely we too are amazed at what we've found. If we've come to guard and received forgiveness of sins, if we have become good followers of Jesus Christ and we are not amazed then there's something wrong with what we've received that god should so love, not just the world, but should so love me, that he gave his son to die for me and that was the sort of er discovery that these four lepers made they've come down there, they've found that the sight before them was amazing, there was no enemy there, the enemy had disappeared and the tents with all their contents were there before them, they were amazed with what they found and you and I when we come to god through Jesus Christ, we are amazed at what we find, we find forgiveness, we find the restoration of a relationship between ourselves and god, we find an access to receive god's blessing to receive his favour, to receive his gifts that he has for us, no wonder the apostle Paul cries out thanks beyond to god for his unspeakable gift, but then again these four men they were not just amazed that what they found, they were, they got absorbed in what they got, because they got a lot more than they bargained for, they possibly in their wildest dreams thought they might at least get, get what the cook was throwing out, they might get to, to the dustbins, they might get what was left over, that would of been great, they were dying of starvation, the driest mouldiest crust would of been like, like a banquet to them, but they got so much more than they anticipated and they got absorbed in it, every thing was there's for the taking as they pulled back the, the flap of the tent as they go in and they see the tables laid out there, they see the food and the drink, they see the plenty, these men who for weeks have known terrible poverty, there might of been a time earlier on in the siege when a few scraps got thrown over the city wall, when the bins were put out the side of the city of an evening, er they would go there and forage amongst them, but all that had stopped long since and it was only the bits and pieces that they managed to forage for themselves and get for themselves that they'd been eating of late, but here every thing is there for the taking, they rubbed their eyes, they pinched one another to make sure their not dreaming, it really is food and drink in a, in an abundance they couldn't of thought of a few mo hours earlier one moment they had nothing, the next they've got every thing, what was it they needed, food, the tables would of been laden with it, it was the food, enough food for an army and there's only four of them, did they, were they thirsty, here was drink, here was wine and, and drink in abundance the rags, the tatters they were dressed in, there were garments and wardrobe full of clothes here for them, did they need money, well the tents were full of the gold and the silver and, and, and valuables, there were a sufficiency, every thing was there you know the idea that the Christian life is drab and poor is such a terrible false hood, its an iniquitous lie of the devil, the tragedy is that we have actually often made it that way, we have made the Christian faith something drab, something boring, something for old folk er and er you know, people who are, who are, just wanting a crutch because their coming to the end of their natural life and we've made it something drab and dull listen to what the apostle Paul says when he's writing to Carinthian's in his second letter in chapter eight, he says you know the grace of our lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might be rich, god, he's purpose follows his people, he's not that we've a drab, grey, dull uninteresting life, Jesus said I've come that you might of life, and that more abundant, that in all its fullness and god has purpose for us, and when Paul is talking about riches there, he's not talking about pounds and pence, he's talking about the richness of the life that we enjoy its not a case of not doing this and having to do that the other thing, its a case of enjoying life as god purposes it, as god intends it you know if you don't enjoy your Christian life now, let me tell you your in for a rude awakening when you get to heaven, because the quality of life is not gonna change the only things that'll change is its la it, it will, it will be in his presence, the quality of life will not change because already now we have received eternal life, he has given his life to us and he hasn't got some other special, you know, super duper life laid up, there's nothing, there's nothing greater ahead, god hasn't got any thing greater for us than what he's already given to us in embryonic form here and now why if we take on er a, a, a dazzling scintillating new zest and zap when you get to heaven, that life is already given to you and to me know go back to these four men at the moment, they had never known any thing like this before this was better than all their birthdays rolled into one, this was the greatest day in their experience and if they would live to be a hundred they would never know another day like this, they were having a tremendous time, it said they, they, they, they went into one tent, listen to what they did, they went into one tent and they, they ate, they drank, they had a party and they carried from there the silver, the gold and the clothes and they went and hid they returned and entered another tent and then they did the same there, they were having a tremendous time, this was a beano to end all beano's, this was the greatest day in their life, they were having a wonderful time and why shouldn't they, why not you know there are folk who would, who'd want to make us as Christians er and er, ee, put us into a straight jacket the bible tells me even the sunsets free, is free indeed and I don't see any suggestions as I read the New Testament, that first of all the life of Jesus was drab and uninteresting, or that he expects me as his follow to lead a drab, a grey life, oh its not always gonna be a ple an easy life but that doesn't reduce the, the zest and the excitement in it but you see the danger is when having a good time is the reason for living and the only reason for it, you see, if god has intervened in our life, if the message of the gospel is true, if god in Christ has taken away your sin and made you in Christ a new creation then you have every reason to enjoy life, in a sense your only able to start enjoying life now, you may have enjoyed some of the things that, that folks suggest that make up life, but they've finished, there gone, what happens when the, when, when the wine has run out, what happens when the parties over, you know all about it the next day, don't you, what happens then, its such short lived, its only worth having whilst its coming to you all the time, but that's not so with a Christian life, because it doe , depend on just the things that we have or the experiences that we go through, because it is something that, that we have within, it is, it is a quality of life that we possess, because we possess the one who is life himself, listen to what Paul says when he's writing to Timothy in his first letter in chapter six it is command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant or to put their hope in wealth, those who think that, that er in having possessions that is the secret of life or, or in having a good time and, and, and the rest of it that is what life is all about, he said warn them not to do that, because that is so uncertain, he says but to put their hope in god who richly provides us with every thing what for, for our enjoyment, why has god given us these things, why is, why is god even, he is natural creation there for us, it is for our enjoyment, its not to make us miserable or to make us grey and drab and burden by it, it is for us to enjoy, when god created Ada Adam and Eve and put them in the garden, the, they were told to enjoy it, even the fruit enjoy it, its there for your benefit and then the new creation, every thing that god has provided is there for our enjoyment, but the dangers is when that enjoyment, is the reason for living and that's all we do it for and were so taking up with ourselves, I am gonna have my good time, I'm gonna enjoy myself as a Christian and I can do it and you can do it, you become insular and we become introverted and the only thing that matters is me having a good time, my world centres around me and me enjoying myself and me having this and me having that, this blessing and that gift and that other blessing, we become self centred and taken up with our own good times, as long as I can be there in the centre, as long as I can go from, from, from this celebration to that celebration, as long as I can go from this er festival to that festival to this special meeting to that one, I'm gonna have my good time well that was what these fella's were doing, they were going from tent to tent, from celebration to celebration having a great time and then the truth hit them they were ashamed with what they had done, they said to one another we are not doing right, this days a day of good news, but we are keeping silent, if we wait until morning light punishment will overtake us, now therefore, come, let us go and tell the kings household how guilty are we, how guilty are you, how guilty am I of the sinner silence, remember how we started, its not always the things that we do its often the things that we don't do, how guilty are we of the sin of silence these men had known nothing, known poverty and, and, and, and starvation, they were amazed at what they'd found, they'd became absorbed in what they had got and now they'd became ashamed of what they had done with it what was the sin that troubled these men they said we are keeping silent. Back in the city there were thousand of people doomed, dying and all unnecessarily because here was plenty, here was sufficient for the whole city and possibly the greatest sin that you and I can be guilty of and that the church is generally guilty of, but you know when we talk about the church generally its, its so easy because that's general, you and I that are the church, not the denomination, not the organization, it you and I, possibly the greatest sin that we can be guilty of is the sin of silence, I'm not talking now about a rude, belligerent, discourteous, butting hole, button holding of people, I'm not talking about that, I don't see any place in gods word for that sort of attitude or that sort of approach but are we still silent, what about with those with whom we have the right, because we've created a relationship, because they know us and they've seen us and they've seen the experiences we've gone through and they've seen what god has done in our lives, what about with those people do we wait for others to do it, shifting the responsibility. thinking in, in, in the context of our, of our mission, this town wide mission, well that's Billy's job, he's better at it than I am, but its not his job, its my job as much as its his and its your job as much as its mine, we do not well to keep silent these men they were troubled by their sin of silence, perhaps you and I should be troubled by our sin of silence because the extension of that, and here's the really great thing, as far as they were concerned, the ex the, the ongoing because they were troubled by their sin of silence and they did something about it, they were thrilled at the sight that they saw, as they see the city being delivered, and as they see starving men and women eating food perhaps for the first time in days or weeks, buying good wholesome food at a reasonable price, that was the sigh that thrilled them and you can imagine them, and I think they'd be entitled to a little bit of pride that I'm glad we told them, I'm glad we went back and shared the news apart from any thing we couldn't of coped with all ourselves, it would of been so wrong to of kept it, it would of been so wrong just to of eaten it ourselves, I'm glad we went back and told them. Jesus said just before he was living his disciples, his followers, you and me, he said you shall receive power after the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me yes we witness by our life but there's a danger in making that a cop out, because one other requirement of a witness is that they talk, they've gotta say what they know, these four men were good witnesses, they went back and they told the city what they had found, and there's placed upon you and me that responsibility to go back and to tell what we've found, this is a day of good tidings, we do wrong to keep silent. what she's going to do. Right. Erm I'm here as a representative of a small company from York, called and what we're doing is we're working on behalf of the Group, who compile and publish the English Dictionary. And what I'm doing here today is, I'm recording this seminar as an instance of spoken English in the nineteen nineties. Which will go towards making a corpus of information from which will draw the meaning and usage of words as it was in the nineteen nineties. And this information will be linguistically analyzed, and then used to help compile the new dictionary which will be coming out in a few years. So I thank you all very much for taking part in this, and I hope you have a happy seminar. The people at the back may not be picked up on this so erm He should be here any minute. Right. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Morning. Sorry for coming in under the wire at er nine fourteen according to this clock. Erm Hugh's asked me to open this morning's erm quality seminar. Erm a a you're in for quite a good day. I know that er the seminar which I attended sparked off quite a lot of lively er debate. And er at the end of it I think we all felt we knew where we were going, and, and what the work that we'd put in over the last three years on the management procedures, which form the foundations of our quality system. Er I think we came to realize what that work was all in aid of. The management team had, I'll sit down if you don't mind, the management team has decided that we were going to go for quality because it was a matter of survival. The industry which we are part of is in excuse me, is in er sorry about this I've dashed across here I I'll read from Hugh's notes if you don't mind. Erm I would like to remind you of my objectives quoted at the time in th in the quality manual. Er to adopt best practices, er from the various offices, to help produce a better end product. To delegate decision making down as far as possible. And as far as our group's vision statement is concerned, to be acknowledged as the leading consultant in the rail er in the field of railway engineering. To provide a professional service satisfact I'm sorry Dennis, would you just excuse me? Can I hand over to you? I I I do apologize. Right. Sorry about that. Sorry I'm totally unprepared for this. Erm To start at the top and unfortunately I'll reread Hughie's notes. Perhaps wavering slightly. Erm It's now thr nearly three years since management procedures were introduced as the first stage of our aspirations to become quality assured. And I would like to you, remind you of my objectives quoted at that time and as are stated in the er manual. That is firstly to adopt best practice from various offices, which hopefully would help us to provide a better end product. And to delegate decision making er to as low a level as possible within the organization, compatible with safeguarding er the quality of the product that we provide to our clients. The group as you are aware do have a vision statement, erm which has been published er and it was er developed a couple of years ago er great effort by the er management team. And that vision statement is, to be acknowledged as the leading consultant in the railway i in the fields of railway engineering. To provide a professional service satisfying our clients' needs and exceeding their expectations. To be a well trained, dedicated and highly motivated team and to be committed totally to safety. Now that vision has not changed. That is still the group's er vision and stated objectives. Erm as far as certification of er th the of a system is concerned er we are still comm committed to getting office certificated and as many of you may be aware the Swindon office has actually overtaken us on the B E S side erm and they are er, but hopefully we will achieve certification for the whole of our group erm prior to Swindon achieving certification for their whole group. The subtle difference is tha that Swindon are going function by function and getting er five certificates. Er ours is a slightly more difficult task, I would suggest a much more difficult task, in that we're trying to go for one certificate for the whole of the group. Erm we believe, er if we are to demonstrate to our clients that we are as good or better than our competitives competitors, then we need certification. And this is seen as a matter of survival. Er fairly recently we were asked to tender for erm a new station at Rickmansworth for Crossrail and one of the prerequisites of that job, er which was a ten million pound project, er one of the prerequisites of that job, was that we should either be certificated or at least have a quality assurance erm system in place. And because er we do have a quality assurance system in place although not certificated, er we were able to tender for that work. Otherwise we would have not been able to tender. Erm I think I'll leave this up till . The basic message of quality, which Mike will er explain later on is, if you improve quality your costs decrease. Because you are continually reducing the number of mistakes that you make and continually improv improving. Erm and therefore you produce less wasted time, less remedial work er and a cheaper product. Erm quality could be regarded as an empty word. We need to bring it about, and it can only be done through teamwork. That's the point that Hughie has set as one of his objectives for the next twelve months, is to get the group acting as one team, and not five or six separate teams. Erm this is going to be extremely difficult because the British culture is one of every man for himself. People tend not to work particularly well in teams in this country. Erm but it's something that we need to work at. And th the Japs actually score in this because they actually believe totally in teamwork. Erm we need to change our culture. Erm I think really I'll just leave it there cos I'm a bit struggling, struggling a little bit to remember quite what Hughie was saying. If you appreciate I was actually thrown into the very deep end. I think perhaps what's going to be said to you to the rest of the day erm will actually bring out the key points tha that Hughie was trying, trying to make. One was that quality is here. Quality is here to stay. Quality is improvement. And the other aspect is one of working as a team. I think those were the two main messages that Hughie wished to get across today, and that we will concentrate on er during the rest of this seminar. Erm th that the seminar is going to be lead by Mike . Er Mike is from Associates and Mike has been helping the, the Q A team on a part time basis, and putting some sensible thought into how the group should go forward. Erm but before Mike comes on I would just like er Norman to make a few comments er on his commitment to the group's er quality system. Morning. Er quality. Definition of quality, right product at the right time, at the right price. Now in P Way Design we have no problems with that, do we? Or do we? Erm we are the most profitable part of the S A U. No problems about that. Er we've no great problems with our technical results, and where they are we sort them out quite amicably with the area people. We meet our main deadlines, which are normally the key deadline normally the S and C. We meet it don't we? So there's no problem. Or is there? Just looking at it in a bit more detail. We're profitable but we normally don't compete with anyone else for getting the work. So effectively we put in what is a fair price, and we get the job, and we do it normally within the price or within a slight overspend. But where we have competed, accidentally in one case, deliberately in another, we've been undercut by our rivals and we haven't got the job. Also a good pointer where we've been able to compare ourselves with civil engineering scaled fees, which was on the Overtown Bank Slip which was a job which went completely right, perfect no problems. If we'd have put in a price based on A C scaled fees, we would have overspent by a hundred and fifty five percent. So we thought. So perhaps there's a, a little bit of work we can do in er in that sphere. The right time. How many times have I had someone come and say, can you sign this drawing please it has to go, go to John tonight. He's taking it for the meeting tomorrow. Er how many times have we said, yeah, we can do this job but we'll, it needs the route improvement that we're doing for Arthur . Or er , Arthur's in no hurry. Well Arthur is a very reasonable and good friends with us. But he notices, it builds up, he starts thinking to himself, they're always late. It's no great problem but I'm not getting it on time. Yet he begins to notice if we do it . Think about our finished product. I said you know the minor er faults and discrepancies, we er tidy up quite amicably with the area people normally. But what we've got to bear in mind is that minor faults in our design can be very serious when translated to a job on the ground which . Also the person who has helped us sort out maybe come to sensible engineering conclusion on the minor problem, but be saying to his chief, there was a problem with the York though I just managed to sort it out. And that builds up. Also what you've got to bear in mind is that inherent in any permanent way job is the capacity for something to go wrong. And when something goes wrong there's recriminations and when there's recriminations, people will crawl for ways out. That is the time for there to be nothing wrong with our drawings. Drawings can be blamed when er there is actually nothing wrong and people are looking for an excuse blame from themselves. So again for reasons like that, we have to maintain the confidence of the client. And that today is what it's all about. If the client is confident that he's getting the best deal from us, he will say, alright Birmingham ar are cheaper than York on a route improvement say, but I've had one of their cheap jobs before. I'll, I'll stick with York and get value for money. Erm drawing the client, is he has confidence in us say, well York have got their act together. If the S if the S and if the S and T give them a, a fair crack of the whip. There's no problems with York, they always given me a good service in the past. And the er technical quality of our drawings the client if he has confidence will say, who are you trying to kid? York drawings are good. just just yarning You're trying to d divert attention erm erm disturb discrepancies. So it's a question of us retaining, because to a certain extent we already have it, due to our customer past. Retaining and renewing customer confidence. And this is where B S five seven fiv five O certification or I S O Nine Thousand and one certification is important to us. As Dennis has said from er Hughie's erm erm er statement, it is a requirement nowadays. And it's valuable to us in, in three aspects. First of all,certification is a bedrock of achievement, like having a degree, and you need a degree or an H N C or an O N C. It's a statement in itself. More importantly, it's er conveys to the client that we care about quality, that we've gone to the trouble to set up procedures which make our product as good as it possibly can be. And thirdly, it has a very real er value in that, in going for er certification, we are actually putting checks and procedures in place which will help to ensure that what we do is the right price, is to the right time and is the right product. So that's basically all er just one after thought, Dennis mentioned teamwork, now we we've been together for a few years basically, but you might say, we work as a team, everyone gets on, everyone helps each other out. We do within P Way Design, which is probably the best office I've ever worked in for that. But what we've got to bear in mind is that we are a multi-functional group. There's PICAS involved, works office involved, to a lesser extent B E S. So that is really where a weakness is, it's in perceiving the needs of other parts, parts of the group. That's something that we do have to work on and I can't emphasize it too strongly. Okay. Er I've said a lot so I'll er leave you to Mike to take things further. Thank you very very much Norman that's great. Have you all got a programme in the folder? So that you've got a vague idea of er what's going to befall you for the rest of today? Okay? We'd very much like you to feel free to ask any questions or comment er er on, on the er presentations during the course of the morning. Er and this afternoon. So don't hesitate to ask questions or, or discuss points which you feel erm have not be made very clearly or perhaps with which you don't even agree. And let's try and resolve any issues which, which come up like that. What we want to do this morning is erm tt talk a little bit to you about er the quality system and the I S O Nine Thousand procedures and er documented er systems, which have been developed so far within the whole group. Er and we want to try and explain a little bit about tt how far we got in terms of achieving certification to I S O Nine Thousand. But we then want to er explain w what this business of quality planning is all about. Because we believe very very strongly wi that with an organization like yours, where each piece of work that you do is slightly different from other pieces of work, to have er a single m way, an approach to following the work er is, is really not, not the right er thing to do at all. What we're looking for is a quality system and a set of procedures which are flexible enough to enable you to handle the slick jobs, which you haven't got a lot of fee income for. And we want you to able to handle the, the complex jobs which require an awful lot of checking and a a a lot of er a lot er detail because the fee for the job is i is, is higher, and the job complexity is high. Er and we we want to be able to have a mechanism within our I S O Nine Thousand system, which enables us to tackle different jobs of different, different complexity. So that's er essentially this, this morning's er er programme, and the objectives which we want to try and er look at and achieve. First and foremost though, we want to go back to basics and erm get our ideas absolutely straight as regards what quality is and what we're trying to achieve with I S O Nine Thousand. There's a lot of misunderstanding about I S O Nine Thousand and I think that Norman's er analogy a few seconds ago is really, really rather good. If you're asking a civil engineer to do some work for you i if that civil engineer has a degree does it automatically mean that the work's going to be perfect and wonderful? No. It doesn't does it? Erm but there are certain civil engineering activities which e I'm thinking perhaps more about the bridge design side of things really, but there are certain activities which actually demand a certain level of qualification before you, you can actually sign, sign off drawings or a or agree to calculations or whatever. Yes? So the fact that you've got a degree or an H N C, or whatever, is actually a starting point. It it's, it's er a, a level from which you y you er you progress and it's the same with I S O Nine Thousand or five seven five O. It's really no guarantee of perfection, Right. Okay. Could I just borrow your pen and I'll write that down. Thanks. Are Red Cross still taking furniture in Stortford? Now where is Red Cross? Erm Well I think the furniture you have to take down to Ware when I last phoned. There's a number in the er when I was Church Street so that's a few years now so it needs to be checked . Would you do that? So it's whether they take furniture? Okay. Newspapers I think that is normally isn't it? Do you think people are folded What's that shop in the Causeway near the sunbed erm it it's a second hand furniture in there isn't it? Is it? But h I mean are people in the habit of wanting to get rid of furniture? I mean I mean if it, if it's really grotty I mean Well you can get I mean, according to the leaflet you can just phone up and get the council to collect . No . Glass, we haven't got any bottle banks. And that's where we need to contact what is in the pipeline Yeah. bottle bank somewhere. Yeah there's, there's one at Sainsbury's now isn't there which is new since that. Yeah there is Thorley Sainsbury's. Thorley Sainsbury's. They have one now? They do. Yes. Oh! They suddenly found the room. Yes actually. Well in a parking block. Er would anyone like coffee? No thank you. one, two. Now what was it, I mean or would you prefer anything else? some tea? Tea? I'll I'll go and check . One thing I struck me this week there's a new regulation as regard punctures on tyres because I had this completely flat tyre and a whole new set of tyres and I said to him well can't you mend it, can't you put an inner tube in like I I've done before cos there was a nail in it you see. Yeah. And I said just get the nail out and re repair the inner tube he said no it's the there's a new regulation this year that if the outer case of the you know the tyre has tea. they're not allowed to repair it because safety regulations because the whole expanse and then supposedly the actual puncture comes off. And I said well what happens to these extra tyres? Right. So he sa , I mean does anybody know anything about anything like that? No, no. Presum I mean I just lost four I know this I just know about about a sort of friend of ours is making money meanwhile in Germany . He found well of course erm connections so he got the permission through the embassy. He's now running lorry loads of worn tyres to Russia, to the Soviet Union and makes money loads of money because the tyres, they couldn't ha get any tyres so the tyres he saw there were totally without profile. You know. Yeah. So the old tyres he could erm find in Germany were a lot better. He carted them over. . Making thousands out of it. Yeah. Well people do that here though don't they? Se sell them to Africa and places yeah . alright if it doesn't rain actually so it wouldn't matter if they didn't have treads on er treads on the tyres if it's dry it doesn't really matter you just go round slicks and I think could chop them up and use them to make road surfaces with. Yeah but percentages is Mm. At least you know they can do it! Mm that's right. Oh they can do quite a lot of it. I mean even the, the su surface out of the play in playgrounds . Mm. I can never quite work out why that . most roads So, so far I've got two coffees here and one tea. Anybody else for anything? I'll have a coffee please. Coffee? Black please. Black coffee. White. White. White. So we've got about six weeks in which to do this. So how many weeks I mean there's no excuse I all the jobs are quite quickly done aren't they? Yeah. So what we ought to have a deadline for collect collecting the information. And then get together Yeah. to put it together. And then decide on And how to And how to get, how to get it to put it together. Shall we say three weeks? Three weeks Yeah. probably for everybody just to do it and Yeah. and I don't think anybody has more time in in four weeks time So if you say six weeks by then you Yeah yeah. It's too near. So the thirtieth of September we'll meet here again. meeting? Can, can we meet at house? Yes. It's more sensible for Meet where? What's your address? Forty two? Thirty two. . Is that alright? Or what? Mondays is actually not very good for me but hopefully by then I don't think I can make that either but er Val, can I have your phone number please? Right. erm what did you say? Thirtieth? Well that's . go through. So plastics erm ya I think that's re-using is better than recycling. And erm then mention the charity shops. I mean we don't need to imply anything there. There's no new recycling centre nearby for plastics is there? So who mentioned this The what? talk about recycling mention that. I just remember it from the . Now Bejam have become Iceland they haven't done the plastic bags collection have they like the, a lot of the . They haven't got a provision for plastic bags Is that worth checking out? I know a lot of the Iceland do have a recycling I I'll do that, if I'm doing plastic bags at charity shops I'll check plastic bag recycling What's happened to Sainsbury's one p back cos they don't actually Yes I was yes they don't actually give you one p any more. No! I think supposed to, they are supposed to. I I always make them give me three p This in the Friend of the Earth, Germany she stayed with us, I really would have liked you to meet her. She was fanatic! You have cat f food in tins! How dare you!you know . What do they from the butcher and Oh, really. Locally, no transport. Cut out transport. Only local foods and If it's available. Yes well mm. So who, who. Are you doing the bottle bank ? You doing the bottle banks? who's doing the bottle banks? Yeah. Thanks ever so much. Because er Caroline once wanted one in a school and we weren't allowed to have it. No I won't thank you. Well there's one at erm . The erm wine merchant. You know erm the one down the bottom of Thorley Hill. Well they were, they were sort of advertising er giving you money back. . I don't know if Down in the er Yeah. Can you find out more ? And also we do quite a few we can write at the bottom er for more inf if you have any more information or something in small print Mm. please contact and then we can do the next few hundred The thing is you can, you can change them very easily. Ya. That means you can er pay for it easier. I wouldn't print more than three hundred for a start. So if we get further information we can always if not we can just get printed. That's very impressive isn't it? That's that council of environment . No sorry. Council's environment advisory committee. Oh that must be that must be the one er Rob's on. Thought this was good about the, buying the R S P C A that boat oil spill. Doesn't look very steady though does it! Yeah they look like! It's ever so tiny isn't it! Yeah. coracle . Well they've got to keep their green image, green image going haven't they? So Kath while you were coffee making we decided on er three weeks for collecting information. Oh right. And another three weeks for production. Which will make the thirtieth of September a meeting at Portland Road. That's a Monday. Although for two of us Monday's aren't good. So I don't know whether I would prefer another day. Three. That makes three. Monday or Tuesday is no good. You can't do Tuesday? Wednesday? Wednesday now Wednesday would be the Second of October. Second of October. It's at your house? Is that all, that's changed then has it Wednesday the second of October? Have we decided on Wednesday? No I think we should thing is I don't think I can but er I mean I might be able to pop in for about half an hour. Because I mean I can find out what goes on Yeah and leave, leave the stuff Yeah beforehand. I'll probably phone it in actually. Yeah. If that's okay. Er second at what ti . Wednesday second of October. What time? Eight thirty. Eight thirty. And this is, this is about the leaflet is it? Yeah. Yes. Get all the information. Decide on how we do the thing. And erm do take it To go into details of that it's probably much more sensible to do it with just two or three people. But er at least if we can pull the information together that evening that'd be a start. Form a sub committee! Ooh! sub committee with everybody present! Well you can always divide up. Thanks ever so much folks and I'll see you Oh you've got to go. soon. See you. Bye Katherine. See you then. Thanks Katherine. Your welcome. I'll be in touch. Bye. So what's gonna be on this stall then? Apart from the new leaflets and a few Some re re-use labels. Yeah. You're gonna buy, you're gonna buy some? I'll send off for some stuff. I'll just do it. Okay. Those Traidcraft ones. We've got some money. Money sitting round accounts doing nothing. How much money have we got? Oh. Probably loads. Can't remember. I'd better let you know what we have got in stock just in case there's anything there that you're Yeah. You haven't have you? No. I I don't think so. Are you gonna get leaflets and you know Friends of the Earth leaflets? I've got l , well they've got loads, I've got a big wallet folder full of all the various leaflets. You have. Right. Erm Car stickers and cakes or anything like produce or I don't know. I mean it, it's up to you. I don't know if it's that sort of a do really. Mm. Hundred and sixty eight pounds thirty nine pence. Oh gosh! Is that their new catalogue or is that the one, the summer one? This is spring summer. It's it's the latest one isn't it? I haven't had another one . I mean they may be just just just about bringing one out so They're just about to bring one out aren't they? The Christmas lot will be out that one. Sorry? August that one. the R S P B Well I I've been sent a local Oh that was is that true? No I've got a No, it said it in there I've got a local group six pound order form autumn and winter ninety one. But I don't think they change that much. I think they just sort of it's the same thing in a different order. And it's it's got a lot of sort of stuff that's left over from Christmassy things That'll do. Yeah. Erm. But I mean do we want to have any produce or anything else? I'm just looking at this stall thinking there's gonna be next to nothing on it. Mm. Yeah. I think if some cakes we need definitely. Oh. So we have to do To make it look right so Good advertising! What is the, what is the concert in fact? Well I, I honestly don't know an awful lot about it. I don't think he knows that much It was low cost through the No cos it's concert. There's going Oh concert. to be a concert there. All Saints, they were going to have a concert weren't they. No. This is at the Rhodes Centre. The Rhodes Centre. The concert at which we've got this stall. Yeah. The Traidcraft's stall. . I mean he kept he didn't know. He said to me on the phone he didn't know a great deal cos he was just getting it all together. And he said, today he phoned me just as I was going out and I didn't really sort of stop and talk to him very long. He just asked me what we needed and I said well a table. We don't really need anything else do we? Like power supply or Oh no quite something with flashing lights on it! So what time of the day is that? It's evening. seven or eight o'clock. He told me. How long does it go on for? No idea. He said he'd phone me again you see. I think if there's a concert there'll be a rush at the beginning and there'll be a rush at the end. Possibly a rush at the, at an interval I suppose. What concert is it then? I mean Well I don't know! Sounds a funny, funny evening to me! bit of a mish-mash isn't it. I mean But he's he just The oth . The other thing we could do. Sorry. Liz. Is is to see whether green consumer Rob and Trish want to, to to have something. I guess that would be a . I mean I wonder who exactly you're attracting if you've got people coming to listen to music and then Well I think something to do with the church isn't it. I think he mentioned the church go through the church ? I don't know what the one,the the there's usually a theme for every one world week each year and I don't know what the theme is for this year. . Act together for tomorrow's world. Yeah! Fine! Well. Yeah. There you go! And he said we come under that heading so. Good. Right. But all he There's nothing else going on apart from this concert I don't know. I'll ask him. I'll ask him . Erm we'd better get on to a few other things. I've got erm Greenpeace written to me. They're having a family fun day on what day is it. Saturday the twenty eighth of September. That's at Much Hadham hall, village hall. Two o'clock to five o'clock. They want to know if we want to have a stall there? Family fun day Much Hadham village hall? Yeah. Do you know where that is in Much Hadham? Opposite the Bull pub isn't it? Right. Er he wants to know do we want to have a stall there and that's gonna cost us five pounds. If we have that. Erm Well you could get produce for that. And then if you ordered now. I bet they probably be really competing with them in a way won't we cos they've got all the same sort of stuff. Won't they? Yeah. Greenpeace sell them mugs and re-use labels and sort of things like that. I don't know what you think. Erm and there's er I would suggest If it's a fun day why don't we do a game or something. Why do, you know. Well it's. They're celebrating their twentieth birthday celebrations. Erm and then th in the evening there's an event. Which starts at eight o'clock with two live bands, cabaret, disco and bar. Tickets three pound fifty. Does anybody want to go? That's a good idea but it's offer to do a game. Well they've got what they've got on here is they've got whale watch talk and slides. . Punch and Judy show. Magic and juggling with ka plate spinning. Er Playbus painting competition. Raffle, refreshments, tombola and various merchandise stalls so I suppose that's us. Quite Mm. Do they do fire eating act or We can contortionism or my legs up behind my neck. An alternative might be to just to ask whether some of our membership forms could be put out so that Well I think they're more interested in the five pounds! Yeah alright well. Yeah. I mean to make a contribution. No to be honest because that that's what Greenpeace do isn't it? Don't you belong? Yeah start the Harlow one up Yeah. the whole of their effort really is devoted to Yeah they don't do it. They're actually, they just do fund raising to their local groups and everything else is obviously sort of controlled by central office or That's right everything is central. Ac action is central or something. Yeah but I mean So they're probably just gonna have their you know merchandise and a few people sort of It's difficult really because I mean we're sort of striving for the same sort of things I know. Yeah. aren't we. It's er you don't want to be seen to be erm Who's it actually run by? competing with each other in any way. Well. I think his name's actually written out. I'm not sure It's like trying to unite the churches. Yeah. It looks like somebody Plus Plusky Oh yeah. No. Oh well. It's signed by s . Oh no sorry.. That can't possibly say . Well it says Leslie at the top. But there's something else underneath. I mean is that but is that a Greenpeace central office thing or is it erm A local group. a local group? East Herts. But does it, Pat does it doesn't he? for Herts yeah. He still does it now. How do you know? that have got so involved in that. Yeah. And and Bob did it here in Bishop's Stortford but I don't know whether he's still I think he still does it because he was very committed. But I I just Pat was doing it for Bishop's Stortford on or thereabouts because he sent me all the details about the whale walk . Cos I I gave his name to this guy organizing the one world week. And he hadn't had any joy out of Greenpeace. Can I borrow that a minute? What this? Yeah The problem we've got with Greenpeace they might not have so much in the way of merchandise and they just have the stickers and There's the leaflets. things and leaflets. Yeah I think it just depends whether the local group want to take up the option or not. I don't think there's anything I've got to tell you. Er except there's a day of action but it's right that's right into November now so you can hear about that . So we this next meeting at Yeah. I I think we can sort out more about the st stall I mean if we can sell things Well this this this er Greenpeace letter predates the September. Oh that is a pity. I think that's actually a bit too soon to get ourselves organized Shall I shall I just write off and send them like pound or donation and a few leaflets could Yeah. Say we're quite prepared to make a contribution, mm. you put them out or circulate them. Yeah? Yeah I mean don't think Rob would be interested. Yeah. He he ought to know about it though I'll ask him about it. Cos he lives up the road from there doesn't he? Oh yeah. Erm And he could collect some money for the . Alright I'll tell Yeah. I expect he, you know they're fairly busy but you know they may well And I'll tell not want to go. Yeah. Anyway I'll see you all on Wednesday Thanks for coming. Erm Bye Liz. I'll going in the afternoon There's a few other things that I've got to get through here. I mean Erm I've got here. I've been sent some stuff by Chris who used to run Harlow group. Oh yeah. Chris who was that? ? . Not Christine! Yeah that's right they cos Erm so I've got a whole long list of all these people who used to belong to Harlow which is absolutely enormous. Is that Friends of the Earth? Yeah. Masses of names loads of money and Well no, I No they've folded now They have folded. Well I think that list is the list that what was his name, Chris? quite a few as well. But if you look properly it's a, that is not only Harlow. Remember he wanted to merge the groups? Don't you remember? Oh yeah. Oh yes. Of course. And he had all the numbers. Because he also works Yes. Some of ou . Yeah. in a erm London. Isn't it the national? No it's it's all the No. He wanted to call it Stort group or something. Oh yeah Stort Valley or something wasn't it? Stort Valley group . Well there's a lo quite a lot. It's mostly Harlow actually when you look through it. But there are Bishop's Stortford ones too. Yeah that's all the And the vast majority's Harlow. That was his plan of having What, what do they do they want. What do they want to do? Do they want join our group or Nothing. He said he he's apparently just moved and he's got involved with this other charity erm to do with the United Nations Friends of the Earth and just passed it on to me. Cos the there there must be useful contacts you see. People who sympathize. we've got the names. Mm. They were fairly enthusiastic when they started off. Mm. So I But I I mean we I don't know whether you think it's worth contacting or not. It might be. Yes. W either when we've got a reason to contact them Yeah. or with a specific letter for them saying you know welcome if you if you feel like it. Actually just just quickly er I just noticed on that list of your questionnaires that we got back a couple that they didn't actually know what was going on. And that you know perhaps this is er erm publicity wise I wonder whether we're falling a bit short on our publicity. Well. they didn't know I mean like first newsletter we've had in ages. And it's something else that we need to get we can't just sort of No exactly We've got to get, we should get more publicity. But it's ever so easy for somebody to sit at home and say well you should be doing this and you should be doing that Oh yeah yeah. and not doing No I'm I'm not sa , I'm not saying. I'm not saying you should be doing anything I'm just er No I didn't mean you, I meant them! No well . I well really I don't think you should say you're not doing enough! No I think last year more or less shows that we really have to concentrate on one thing. Do it and then plan Yeah. plan the next . Because otherwise we just And then write about it if we want to. Yeah. So what what we'll do quickly to write and inform them all that we're doing this stall and won't we? Yes. We could even send them a recycling sheet. Yeah. And the most recent newsletter. Yeah. Yeah. And a, and a short letter I do don't know whether you said that. Are you talking about this lot or Yeah. or that lot? Sorry? Yeah sorry I was also tal we were talking about our own membership talking about Stortford Oh right! and we passed on. No I think they I mean They complain they don't get any information. My first contacts with Friends of the Earth in this region sort of what six years ago was Harlow. Mm. And they were all enthusiastic and confident and Well what happened to them? And when there was another friend who was still over here at that time. And we went three times and they always planned and planned and planned and had ideas what they could do. And they never pulled round to actually doing it No. properly. Right. And I think the same happened as with us. They wrote letters and they did didn't have the energy Mm. to write again and again you know And you never get a positive answer, clear answer first, first time round do you? Mm. You have to write and and write more details or put more pressure on and have more people write. But if you just write a single letter Yeah but you should . I know you two have been Yeah. Mm. I'm used to it. I mean it evaporates. . Didn't we have er a membership thing which said about erm membership form which actually explained what what we did in if you want to join return this sort of thing. Yeah. I've got loads of those. Have you still got those? Yes. I've got all those. We've still got those somewhere then. Yeah. Well I've go have got the . I don't think I don't know if I've got a master. But I know I've got lots that could be copied so we could send them out. Well I've got the master still somewhere. Well anyway it's something to bear in mind the fact that we've got that list anyway. Erm Yeah how many. Sort of what's the approximate number of people on it? I don't know. I'm not very good at estimating numbers. One two three four Oh and then there was there's it's it's it's not all Harlow it's all just Yeah it's Stort Valley. Ya. This Chris what was his name? I don't remember. I don't, didn't even know his name was Chris. Don't you remember he he then suggested th that walk along the Stort? I do yeah. I mean I'd forgotten all about him but I can remember Do you remember that. That was a really silly thing wasn't it? Can I just have a look Kath? Yeah. He organized it all and then I think was it a week before he suddenly said well we can't possibly have two hundred people walking along a nature trail that we want to protect. And he was really of the illusion that there might be I think two hundred no six hundred people Two hundred people might turn up. turning up. In the end I think three people turned up. Oh. It was, it was no it was This looks really interesting. get it. I had to write off Yeah. Er it was a nice er display thing to show to show the kids when you do talks in schools. Yeah yeah. Well I mean I'd certainly use it. Is is that Greenpeace? Yeah that's what I think is it's no It's a resources pack Mm. It's his own is it? Well he's obvious they've obviously the group has bought it and he's got it and he's gonna say do you want to buy Oh yeah. Oh yeah. for ten instead of twenty. Originally cost twenty pounds and we could get it for ten it's er It's Chris it's erm living forests resources pack. Looks good doesn't it?that I thought. Erm with all sorts of po posters and teacher's notes and things. Well I firmly believe in building up a library . So do I. Good I'm glad I I mean there's you said that because I w I want to buy a book! no library because I think er if you are contacted for information and you are able to say okay we have a book or we have books. Yeah. That's that's one of the things I I I ke , I've kept all my New Scientists. I keep these. Yeah. I go through them gonna collate that cos there's loads of stuff in there good. Yeah. But I do get quite a few people phone me as you know asking for information. I just photocopy relevant bits None of none of them has got in contact with me. Really! No. Aren't they funny. I get the feeling Well I should give you er that they either phone in. Phone me and then get it all given to them just like that. That yeah. And no further effort involved cos Well I should, I could . No it isn't. This woman who, who keeps phoning me up about all this oil pollution on her land. She she. I sent, I wrote off to Friends of the Earth, I got a load of information all about the law and she still phones me up and say oh you know what the District Council's they won't do anything and the N R A wasn't doing anything. And I said well when did you last contact them? February! Apparently she's got a problem that the oil pollution is coming off this site where they're refurbishing the boilers. It's gotten on to her land and off her land and into the ditch, which is you know the N R A Where is that? Er Roydon some way? You know where all those nurseries are? And because the oil is coming to the ditch via her land they can't have a go at the primary source. This is what she said and I, to me it doesn't sound right. She said nobody'll Nob they all say they haven't got the power to prosecute and I said well the N R A has. They've got more clout than anybody else. Mm. More clout than the District Council. And then she keeps saying but you know what these councils are like. And I said I'm not talking about the council, I'm talking about the N R A! And now she wants me to find out how can er found out about a solicitor or somebody who specialises in this sort of thing. To take the District Council to court. So that she's more expensive to them than this other lot will be. Apparently they're causing quite te dreadful pollution. It's all this oil from the boilers leaking on to her into her soil and out into the ditch. Well Certainly is. But erm in the back of my mind there comes that she's saying to me don't get involved, don't get involved. You know who owns all that land, it's the mafia. And this could be why she's getting nowhere. You could give her er erm er wr , give her the address of Friends of the Earth, London. Oh she's already . That's how she got in contact with me! You see they refer everybody on and then I Well but they should give her a soli , the name of a solicitor. There must be green solicitors about. I have to write to them and ask them and about a month later they reply to me and I pass it on to her. Because I don't know off hand. I've asked Jeffrey to ask a friend about it who's a solicitor if he knows anybody but I c , I can't I haven't got the in information. I don't Does anybody of you remember where Friends of the Earth England erm analyze their expenditures. Their income and their finance for the last year? I I saw it somewhere and I got lost track of it. And I was appalled as to how much they spend on publicity. But I can't do anything with it because I lost the numbers. Mm. I don't know I'll have, have a look. I don't remember seeing The thing is this . Does anybody of you seen that or remember? No. No. No. So are we saying yes to that? Yeah. Yeah. Erm can I just ask you. Does anybody wanna go on the energy campaign weekend? No thank you. And there's this book. Which I think we might like to don't worry . Erm energy without aids. Which I think would be a good idea if we got it because I don't know about you but I'm always having arguments with people who say oh we can't have the whole country covered in windmills and Mm. things like that. They all think nuclear powers okay. So we really need to know our What's the energy thing weekend just out of curiosity? And Good. Right. Go on I don't. I don't know these things. No. Well you don't get them. I do and I feel obliged to pass it all on. I can't just sort of No. But it, I, it's only six ninety five and I thought if we had you know a few facts at our fingertips to say well that's all rubbish you know. So what is that? Is that er booklet or something? It's a book. Book. Just talking about al you know alternative On erm renewable yeah energy really I think. Yeah. Because they keep saying oh what's gonna happen when the whole population of China wants a fridge and Mm god! I haven't got an answer for things like that. Mm. There is no answer really. Because want to catch up with us and we're already using too much energy. change your lifestyle. I just thought the more facts you've got at your fingertips the more easy it is to persuade people. Yeah if we've got some money we might as well spend it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Educate ourselves. An and the next day of action as I said before is on tropical rainforests erm . Connection with er tropical woods Oh we did actually do November the ninth. for the architects. Like Hertfordshire architects Yeah. for example. Do something basically have a Yes mailshot or ring them up or. They're a pretty depressed lot at the moment Yeah I bet they are. They have nothing to do Not much to look forward to so they'll probably like a bit of excitement. Nothing to do. No I I don't know what it's going to be about they haven't sent any information. It's just that er I've got the date. Right. When when they say. Is it an action day ? It's an action day. It's the next day of action and What date? That's a Saturday. What date? November the ninth. It's only just after the one world week thing. Well it's October. Well if I if I get Well it's only two week's after. Yeah. and I don't know what it's going to be You know know which would recommend Yeah. This. I mean I have been into this window frame business. Mm Because we have to have sash and sash soft wood. So anyway various companies wrote. Well they do use tropical rainforest wood but Yeah. it's government er schemes. Yeah it's like some sort of erm okay. Yeah. And I mean I have, I I remember that on some T V programmes they they said it's all bogus Mm. I mean that it is not really government run er . They reforest it but what they reforest is eucalyptus or Yeah palm erm they oil palm plantations Mm. Mm. They just er . Actually I've got a, I've got a brilliant picture that I took outside the train. Erm we were travelling through Malaysia and erm it's just one canopy tree standing on its own in the middle of nowhere. And there's all this sort of undergrowth. And it's obviously that one wasn't, just didn't want it or it was dead or something and they just left it. Mhm. And it's just the one. And then I've got all the pictures of all the logs on the train wagons and er that was really it was a, it was a good picture actually cos I thought oh look at that poor old tree there it's Yeah. all its friends and then it was just standing there on the ground. But really it's completely it's completely wiped out Malaysia the whole of central Malaysia is just just gone. And all the soil's eroding cos it's sort of sand and it's red. And it goes into dust. So it goes everywhere so I mean there's gonna be trouble with that in the future . It's where they get all the flooding isn't it? Oh yes. Right. Oh. okay. Thanks. Thank you very much. discussions with Richard Robert. Robert sorry here you go. That'll come out on there you see and I'll get tell myself off. That's probably cos you know. We've gotta design redesign this cos everybody off. Oh sorry apologize to the last guy he didn't. Richard while I'm having oh It's that again. That was a Richard. Cut. Robert while I'm having a look. Yeah edit that. While I'm having a look at this just a quick glance through erm there's the er range of products that we print design publish, we don't sell them, for our clients. Erm if you'd like to have a quick glance through them. Yep. Just get your feel for it. Yep. I'll have I'll have hopefully described them as as much as I can over the erm over the phone but er and of course the brochure. Did what did you glean for the erm company brochure? Very professional. Mhm. Er forward going. Always looking to, how can I put this, upgrade things is it like you know. Pardon? All these looking to upgrade things you know. Er going forward. Okay. Oh sure. Er you know and Yeah yeah. Four years ago the erm er two thirds of those products weren't in existence. Yeah. Erm the law has helped us. Legislation helped us with the medical practice booklets. Yeah. The law also helped us allowing a lot of professional companies to advertise which they couldn't. You know like accountants solicitors doctors chemists. None of those could advertise So in so it's broadened the number of er prospective advertisers that we can approach. Yeah. Totally new this industry so Erm I have to say that most of the people that come to us have never been involved in advertising. Yeah. One of the things I am obviously gonna have to look at is the what you've done in the last two or three years because traditionally erm we wouldn't ask van drivers to come along and see us . Yeah well there's there's But there's there had to have been there's a good reason for that. Yeah right. Well I wouldn't Well I I would well I'd feel I'd feel more comfortable with people at least who have made an attempt to er to do something to earn a living. Well I've never signed on the dole so You're trying to avoid that. Yeah. I haven't although a lot of people would say I was silly for not having done. Because I probably lost out on a lot of money. Well I well I tell a lie I tried it once. Mhm. Er in between sales Aha. jobs. Er and I was told that I wasn't entitled to any money anyway because I was self-employed and I only paid the stamp . Yes well that's exactly what they said to me. And er you know I thought well Thoroughly annoyed me because I'd er every year when I'd paid my tax I'd pay my er national insurance and as far I'm concerned that should've entitled me. Yeah yeah. Oh you can income support but it's not why should I be any different. I think it's something that they probably have to look at fairly seriously because er I think you do the Government a a lot of favours by going self-employed. Of course you do. You take self take the employment figures down for a start. Yeah. Er yeah I mean that that's never been discussed by anybody or know or Mm. anything or it's never published that if you go self-employed No er I I I have er if you're out of work you're it takes small businesses of. Erm and one of the things I could've done was to em er become a salaried employee of my own company which was a limited company but I paid myself as a consultant. Yeah rather than a director. Yeah. And nobody told me that. And you're supposed to know all about the bits of paper that they issue. It does annoy me. Anyway that's got that's put the world to rights hasn't it? Yeah. Okay er Robert. There you are I got it right for Yeah I'll confuse now call me Paul That's right yeah. Thank you. Erm well first of all er I'll I'll come back to that. First of all the company is very serious about taking up references. Yep. And they ask for four for a very good reason. At least they want to get a cross-section. If may be one doesn't respond at least we've got a good er Yeah. And quite honestly if two give er a good references but I would I would have to address that once we decide Right. er what the outcome of this is going to be today. Er now let's go back over oh first of all let me explain what the idea is Hello. It is indeed. Hi Lynn. Oh that's fine okay. Yeah very kind of you call because some people don't. Lynn than thanks very much. Bye bye. Yes we get a lot of people who don't turn up at least a a phone call is er Right. Must make a note of that. Yes I wanted to erm outline what the you know the purpose of these discussions today er so that we can get to the point where we can get into er get into more detail. Erm first of Er Did I speak to you originally? You did yeah. Okay. So I would have heard enough on the phone er because I haven't got my original notes here, I would have heard enough on the phone er Robert to have suggested that it was a good idea to get face to face. So there's a lot of the discussions have taken place and also I would have briefed you a bit er Yeah. on on what it was. Self employed commission only. I would have said at forty one you know you er you're still probably young enough to get a salaried job but we decided that it might be worth er you trying this avenue. The brochure also would have outlined a number of other aspects in in more detail than I could give you on the phone. And today really is er decision day that er first of all we'll get one of the hurdles out of the way whether you and I think that this is a good You think yeah. er way for you to be er earning some money. I know that a lot of money can be earned. I've experienced it myself and there are a plenty of top earners in our company who er arrive in a Porsche and er and er things like that. So some big money earners. Erm once that hurdle's out of the way if it is a hurdle er once once we've agreed on that er the next decision we'll make is on er which company you and I think that you're more be comfortable the environment in which you er we operate. Because we all do the same thing. A hundred and seventy five I think was the last count that we have around the U K all selling advertising. And the only difference between them er one group and another is may be the pitch is slightly different and the benefits. Otherwise, oh and the pricing is slightly different, Yeah. otherwise it's er er all the same. We're doing all the same. Certainly the opportunities to earn all the same er er er are the same across all companies. All right opportunities. Yep. Erm so that you know it's it's a luxury that I have. I'm looking it's not one job for one person in one company today. It is I'm looking for five er may be for each of those companies so that's thirty people I could be looking for. I'm not but I you know could be. Yeah could be. But I want somebody in every one of those companies. So there's not a problem. So you're not in competition with anybody else. Right. Erm and the other aspect of course is when. We do like people to give us a commitment on the spot on on all of those three counts. Er when we have a training course for all of these companies. There's no way we're going to send people out er to sell advertising er particularly as the majority of people have never done that before. Yep. Certainly it's not in your background and it's not in most people's I have to say. Erm and er er we don't hide behind reject letters. If I don't think you're suitable and if I don't think this is for you I'll I'll say You'll tell me yeah. Straight up. I'll be up front with you . Yep. Erm I also want and because I You'll say well I'll give the commitment. If you say if you don't think this is for you you've got to tell me that. Erm I don't go into big sales pitch you know to bring you into the company. What I will do is emphasize what we you know where you can go in terms of money- wise. And the other thing is is when. Now accordingly to your application form here er you you've no problem you can start yeah. All right. And I will give you that commitment as well. I'll say, Fine you want to start with us you want to start in this company here's your date for your course fully expensed. Travel hotel bills everything. Then out on to an assignment or with somebody in the field for a couple of days whichever company you go into. All right? So Yeah. that's if you like the the big picture. I'm now going to put on the lights that's better I thought it was a bit dull in here. It was lovely and sunny when I first came in You were nice when that light was on. Aye? You were nice in the first light. Yeah yeah now I can actually see what you look like. Okay well you really want to with us don't you? Don't go slanging the recruiter right. You gotta you'll get a flashback off the top of my head . Okay Robert Bob Yep. Erm your background here. That's have a look through this. First of all erm we'll you you you've obviously been round the construction industry a bit. If I can interpret these. Erm a roofing contractor for for twelve years there right? Yeah. That was is was that the doing the selling er you've got roofing foreman here but that was the doing of was it? That was the doing of yep. Okay. Erm that was for twelve years. And then you make what a lot of people would be er consider er er a quantum leap. Into sales. Into sales from being what I would call an artisan and er I don't know what you would call yourself, but somebody who does things erm er on a er manual stroke artisan type work, over to sales. Home security systems I have to say that home improvements is the most likely jeep er leap that people will take first time Yeah. and or merchandising for one of the confectionery companies whatever. Explain why why what was behind your your leap into sales? At the time er well I've always through the roofing right you you come up against site fore you know site foreman general foreman clerk of works and I I've always got on well with I can always talk to people. Okay. Er when the building trade or that company moved out the north east. I was with them in Glasgow as well they were a national company and I came down here from Glasgow . This is what ? H H . Oh sorry oh the first one yeah The first one yeah. Okay. I came down here because they were running out of work in Scotland initially. And er then Mrs Thatcher if you like and cut back council er subsidies and things happened and the work just ran out. Right it was mostly skilled And this was why the company pulled out of the, it says out of the north, are they still in existence or were they in I I don't know. No in eighty four they they weren't going under they were Oh no no no they just pulled away. Er I went back down south again. Er as I say they were a U K company. Were you sort of left stranded then or did Yes. you have something in er is this when you That's when I went in with myself. Okay. It was it was somebody I knew er in the club. So it was a contact? Yeah. All right. Er Who told you you could sell probably. That's how I got into it that's for sure. Yeah well he said er I don't see any reason why you couldn't you know. Yes. I've always been a sort of I won't say outgoing personality let's say right. Er Extrovert. Yeah well. It's another posh word for it. Yeah. I always take people at face value and talk to people. Okay right. You know. Er never had any fear of that. Right. I look at a person and if you like me you like me Well that's let's face it if you don't well you don't. let's face it that's half the battle. Er Okay. So I got into that. Erm And in Newcastle are are a local company obviously. Well again er they were U K based you know nationwide . Nation nationally. Yeah national company. Er but I unbeknownst to myself and near the end it was a sales manager that had a team of men under me and you know and things like that. And then all of a sudden in a span of about three month a lot of deals started er going by the wayside let's say right. You know guys were bringing in deals I was going out and selling Aha. cos you can't let one alone No. as you probably know. And they were going in the next morning, oh they'd phoned up they'd cancelled. Er I've talked them back in but it's a house account so obviously there's no money in for me you see ? Oh that's what you mean by erm Right. auth unauthorized deal. Okay. It was the nicest way I could have thought of put it. What happened was they were actually starting You probably wanted to use stronger language though did you R er Bob? Yeah and that sort of espionage. You know but that's. What was happening was they were starting they were ready to start up their own company to hire managers. Oh right. And so and we were bringing in deals and they were phoning the clients back and saying, Look yeah great alarm systems blah blah we have an alternative one cheaper. And they were fitting in their own until they got up and running. Okay. So you know. Well you lasted there for a couple of years. What what do what do you feel you gained most from er from this er this first two years in sales? In sales? Confidence in myself again. Aha. You know just getting well cos as you know you don't know who you're gonna talk to. Sure. You knock a door and the door opens and that's your first contact with the person . So of course course these were by the title there, Home security, these were all domestic were they you didn't deal with businesses Didn't do commercial. Okay right. No. Er it was all home security systems. Er very high tech very expensive. That's another thing I found The er infra red the system wire free Yeah okay. was all transistorized. Yeah. Er Totally wire free? Well there was two wires. From the main from the main box one to mains one to the outside Yeah okay well that's signal box. system I've got yeah. Yes one I've got as well. A good system. Er and from then You know again it was a professional company it start with we were doing in Manchester for a week's training. This is ? Yeah. Aha. Er very professional course. Very professional. For somebody that had never been in sales before you remember a lot from the course Ah that that was that was yes that was really what I was going to er behind my question or included in my question, is that what did you learn from that Yeah. is that er er you know you you certainly need some training and backup . You need good training. And it was a very intensive course. All right. Anyway the way a course should be run. Er they take you up for twenty minutes intensive and then drop it Yeah. for ten and then take you know so you can absorb things . I I haven't been on one of our courses for a little while but I think that's very similar to er That's the way it should be. You can't cram You see you may have been in sales but in advertise this is erm Well it's entirely different totally different sell yep. Erm All right. But I er what did you learn about people in those two years especially the er the people in the company you worked for. You watched the watched the shysters watched out for the shysters. Yeah oh a lot of back stabbing going on. Well direct sales you you know I always tried to sort of stay away from companies that you know had a reputation for that. Okay. Right. Always sold expensive Right. for the reason the product was worth it. Okay. You know I I I've never I Yeah we're I'll tell you right now we're not the cheapest, sorry the least expensive I should say. That's right I I have the least expensive. I have deviated from that one as well I don't like the word. But er if you get into that sort of squabble er price cutting and things like that Aha. I believe your credibility goes out the window for a start. Mm. If you sell product like that you get more hassle with it. Well you've just you've just er allow you've just said something that allows me er to bring in er the way in which we approach advertising sales er Robert because er all of us who've been in tra traditional sales, and I'm I'm just er that was my background as well er in addition to recruitment, er we are not used to giving everything over the phone before we go to see the people. We are literally only trying to get the appointments so that we can That's right break breaking the ooze our personality show our lovely brochures and product range and say, not even mention the price until they say, I want that one. Er well okay it'll cost you this. And they may have chosen the most expensive. But because they've you've sold it to them. In advertising sales we actually do all that on the phone and then, but all our our personality comes across. Yeah. And because we could chase our tail. You can make a dozen appointments that were advertising and you may come out with one deal. Whereas when we make appointments to see people we are there It's to sign up. to sign up. Yeah. Okay. Now there's nothing wrong with that. I've discovered that because I I've sold advertising. I've discovered that that is the only way, with one or two exceptions that might occur, the only way to stop yourself wasting an awful lot of time. It saves you money. You've got a limited number of slots to sell so you don't need to go thrashing around the country That's right hard sell. using your own petrol. That's it you must get a commitment on the phone. Say well I'm only I'm gonna come to you to sign you up. Yeah. I'll tell you everything you want to know on the telephone now. Price size what it's going to do for you. Two years contract banker's order deposit cheque. Er I'm just listing out there Yeah. are plenty of others they'll tell you on the course. Yeah. Because erm it's gonna save you an awful lot of time and money. And we know from twenty years experience of doing this It works. that it works very well. Our top earners will tell you there's no secret to earning twelve hundred quid a week. Just except work. Mhm. And listening to the people who've been doing it for years. Okay well you you erm you cut your teeth on home security systems. Found out there are some people you have to keep your eye on. And cover your back. N E H I, that's close to being N E I which is a big company in N E I Parsons. It's . Right okay thank you you've just preempted my next question. Based in er in Newcastle. Home improvements what were they in? Double glazing. Double glazing. Yeah. Okay. Because there are quite a range of home improvements Yeah. You've just hit on home improvement companies are legitimately go into all of our products if they want to. Yeah. There's none none that can say, It's no good me going in the schools one. Because they have two thousand parents . There's no excuse for them not to go into the medical practice booklet because they've got fifteen thousand patients or thereabouts. There's no excuse in fact they are very supportive of course of the estate agents. Yeah. Because they're all prospective home buyers. So you've hit on an area that er make up a big advertising chunk that we have. Okay now you you er what from your experience with home security systems were you able to take to er N E H I? Just er selling steps I suppose. Okay. What what you'd learned from did they send you on a No. course? No. So it was hands on It was well there was an ongoing training every morning sort of thing. You know you went in and you went out with the reps and Massaging the shoulders and psych you up yeah I know. Say yeah you can make you know the big bright lights and things like that. Which again if you accept What sort what sort of commissions can you get on double glazing? You can make a lot of money. A lot of money. It it must be on er ante social hours though is it? Oh yeah. A lot of it done during the evenings and weekends? It's all evening weekends you know. This is the only nine to five sales job I've ever been able to offer anybody. Yeah. Because you
