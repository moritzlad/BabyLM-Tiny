big veranda. –And they said you were a beauty. –Really? What else did they tell you? You'd be surprised what a bloke can learn if he's interested. Judy... Mrs Smith was looking for you. Something about the washing up. Yes, Mr Cleary. Judy? That wasn't nice. Still interested? Listen, man, you ought to give that contest a bit more thought. You're a good match for Bob. I could out-shear Bob Cleary any day... if I was cruel enough to show him up in front of these men. Bob's not like that. And what do you care, anyway? You'll be going down the track in a couple of weeks. Pete, who's that girl? That's just Meggie. Now, listen... there's good money in this contest, I'm telling you. Shouldn't swim alone, you know. Too dangerous. And what are you doing here? Seeing you don't drown. I don't know why you'd swim in that thing, anyway. It smells like hell. It's the sulfur. I'm Luke O'Neill. Meggie Cleary. Meggie? That doesn't suit you a bit. Not enough dignity. I'm going to call you Meghann. I detest the name Meghann. Good night, Meghann. I often wonder what can account for such sadness... in a face with so much spiritual beauty. I should be sorry to think that I look sad when I pray, Your Grace. No, but it's true. And at other times... when you think no one is watching. And the passage of time seems only to deepen it, my Ralph. Perhaps it's the Irish strain in me. We're a tragic lot, you know. You received a wire from the Vatican this morning. The Athens Conference is all arranged. I'll soon have our travel plans in order. Splendid. The Church is long overdue for some discussions... with our Greek Orthodox brethren. I'm delighted you want me to accompany you. It will be excellent training for you. A good opportunity to nourish your career as a church diplomat. And besides, you know very well... that you have become indispensable to me, my dear Ralph. If you're not with me, how could I possibly continue... my interesting little game of working out... precisely what makes you tick? It's too early to tell, but we could have one of the biggest clips ever. It's nice to see the place get back on something like a paying basis. I don't believe it was only two years ago, Christmas, that we were almost burnt out. Couldn't have done it without Father Ralph... advancing us the money for new stock. Good day, Meghann. Missus. Good day, O'Neill. What can we do for you? –I've come about the shearing contest. –I thought you weren't interested. The lads have been on at me about it, so I thought I might give it a go. Fine, just name your terms. If I was to win, what would you say to hire me as a stockman? –A stockman? –Just for a month, say, to try me out. I know my way around livestock, all right. I thought we weren't hiring any new stockmen this year. If Luke here is as good in the saddle as he is at the board... Stone the crows, you'd think I'd already lost this contest. What if you lost, O'Neill? Same terms, except I work the month for free. You'll actually work for no wages just to be a stockman? But that's daft. You could make more at shearing, anyway. Yeah, but a shearer's a rover. I don't intend to be a rover all my life. And I do like it here on Drogheda. All right, lads, this is the last call. Gentlemen, let's hear them. This £5 on Cleary. I'll match any of that. Now, we all know the rules. The men will shear for two hours only... and since my own brother's in there, I'm stepping out. So I want one of you shearing men to keep score... and you, Drogheda lads, choose a man to watch the time. –Are we ready, men? –Yeah! Mr Cleary, show him what a boss cocky can do. We'll show him! Hold him steady, O'Neill. Come on! Here we go. Come on. All right, Mr Cleary, come clear. Just squeeze him through the breezer. Hurry up! Down the chute! Good show, O'Neill! You're making twice the number of blows because you're not filling your shears. Fill your shears, boy! Don't let us down. Come on, O'Neill. That's it, O'Neill, you've got him on the run now! –Come on! –Jack, who's winning? It's only half-over, still an hour to go. But looks like old Bob's losing so far. Losing? Come on, Meggie. Judy, you go back to the house. You can do it. Long blows, Mr Cleary. Fill your shears, boy! Luke, pay attention! Come on, Bob, let's show them what Drogheda men are made of! –I could out-shear that learner. –That's his job, missus. Stay in there, Bob! You can do it! Don't stop! Keep going! Come on, Bob! Two minutes to go! Go! Go! What did I tell you? I taught him myself! What about a cheer for a bonzer opponent? Luke O'Neill! Hip, hip, hooray! There's not a pub around for 40 miles, but if a barrel of rum and another of ale... will take away the sting, they're outside! Well done, Bob. That's my Bob. Feel like a champion, then, Bob? –Congratulations, Mr Cleary. –Bob. It was only by half a sheep. Could have gone the other way. You've got yourself a stockman, free of charge for the next month. Then if you like what you see... There's not much to see here now we got the wool away. I wonder you didn't go with it. You don't appear to have made much of a bargain here. I'm happy with it. There's a dance next Saturday night. Will you come with me? Thank you, but I can't dance so there wouldn't be much point. There's nothing to dancing. I could teach you in two flicks of a lamb's tail. Wonder if your brother would lend us the car. We ought to go in style, don't you think? –I said I wouldn't go. –No. You said you couldn't dance... and I said I'd teach you. Not scared, are you? No. Not here. It's only a wool shed, you know. And it's a wool-shed ball we're going to. Now... One, two, three... One, two, three... –Having fun? –Don't let go of me. I don't intend to. You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in that dress. Thank you. I don't really like it, but it's the only party dress I have. Go on, a posh girl like you? You could've bought as many dresses as you liked. Is that what you think? That I'm some snobby squatter's daughter? Because I'm not. The Clearys don't even own Drogheda, and we never will. Touched a nerve, didn't I? I'm sorry, Meghann. I know the blessed papists did you out of your place. –What do you mean? –My, but we're sensitive. I suppose now you'll never have me because I'm Protestant. –You are? –Orange through and through. I think the Catholic Church is run by a bunch of poofters... in black nightgowns. You do waltz divinely, Mr O'Neill. I do hope Meggie is not intending to be selfish. It would be an honor to dance with you, Miss Carmichael... but, you see, Miss Cleary here has hired me for the whole night. –This isn't so bad, is it? –What? –Dancing. –I think I'm learning to like it. Good, 'cause there's another dance next week... and the week after that, and the week after that. So I went to the wool shed when I was 12, as a tar-boy. Me and my mate, Arne Swenson. He's the best, Arne is. Always looked out for me. –Is he still shearing? –No, not Arne. He runs a gang of cane-cutters up in northern Queensland. You reckon shearing's hard, but I tell you there's not too many blokes... big enough or strong enough to cut the sugarcane. You make it sound like your life's ambition. I wouldn't mind trying it for the money it can make. My life's ambition is to have my own place... my own sheep station, up in western Queensland, where I come from. And I will someday, too, have my own place. And someone to share it with. Someone who'll love me and work alongside me. God, you are beautiful. How many times have you been in love? Only once. Whoever he was, he was a fool to let you go. Good night, Meghann. You did not understand this play, Phaedra? You've noticed how quiet I've been through the conference here in Athens. My Greek isn't up to yours, I'm afraid, Your Grace. You must study your languages if you're to be a church diplomat. The dying youth in the play is Hippolytus. He is cold to Aphrodite, the goddess of love. To punish him for his neglect... she causes his mother to fall hopelessly in love with him. But, Hippolytus spurns her. And that's why she kills herself? Hippolytus' father blames him and has him killed... by the God of the sea. A cruel story, and so unjust. Hippolytus dies even though he's innocent. In fact, he behaves laudably. A good Catholic interpretation, yes, perhaps. But to the ancient Greeks... he is quite guilty of the sin of pride. You see, it is that Hippolytus holds himself... above human love. He's cold. He will not even admit that human passion exists. And what if he would admit it? Would he then escape his fate? That is the cruelty... because this is his fate. He cannot choose to love... anymore than his poor mother can choose to be cold. The gods have willed it for their sport. Cruel, but rather an appealing system, is it not? No decisions to make, no conscience, no agony of free will... nothing. All fated from the first. Rather shockingly at odds with the teachings of the Church of Rome. My dear Ralph, do you not find it humbling to realize... that when this play was first performed... Rome was still infested with fur-clad barbarians? They simply find you beautiful. Blessed by the gods, perhaps? They've been out together again. I don't see the harm. He never lets it get in the way of work. But I'm beginning to see why he likes it so much here. I'm just as glad. He's the only man Meggie's ever shown the least bit of interest in. And somebody's got to keep the Cleary line going. I hope that Meggie is all he wants. I saw Angus MacQueen in Gilly the other day. He seemed to think that Luke might be something of a fortune hunter. A fortune hunter, Luke? Of course, Meggie does have the money Father Ralph sets by for her... but it's not what I'd call a fortune. Some might, though. But I think he's just what he appears to be. A hardworking bloke with plenty of ambition. I suppose you're right. Anyway, Meggie's a grown woman. How she chooses to spend her life or her money is her own affair, isn't it? You know... I was just thinking... of that old woman in the market. She reminded me of how very certain I once was... that I had found your Achilles' heel. Those looks of yours... They had to have made you the target, or perhaps even the victim... of so many desires. But, I have tested you... had you watched... thrown you together with beautiful women, and with men. No result. Not a flicker. No. Whatever you burn for, Ralph... is not for the flesh. I am... surprised, Your Grace. Shocked, you mean, by my methods. But you shouldn't be. They are simply tactics of which you must be aware... if your weakness lies where I think it does: in ambition. If that is a flaw, I shall try to mend it... Archbishop. I might find that rather tedious as it is a weakness which I share. And like all self-perpetuating institutions... the Church has always a place for ambitious men. In fact... you are everything the Church admires... in her high officials. You are conservative, quick, subtle. You know enough never to give away... what is going on behind those eyes. And you have the most exquisite gift... of knowing how to please. Even when it comes to pleasing those you loathe. You make me out to be a Machiavelli, except that he was an Italian. My dear Ralph, you are a delight. I can scarcely wait to see your effect on our short, fat prelates in Rome. Rome? The beautiful, sleek cat among the plump, startled pigeons. In time, my ambitious friend. In time. These conferences will soon be over... and then we shall see... what fate has in store at the Vatican... for both of us. This is great. We do have better in Queensland, of course. You can't imagine how absurd you were that night, claiming I might drown. You could've pretended you were drowning. –And make myself as ridiculous as you? –Then I could've swooped you up... Put me down. And do what I've been wanting to ever since that moment. No. That's enough. –I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. –You didn't offend me. Really. I suppose... I'm just not very used to it, that's all. That's all right. You said you'd been in love once, so I thought he must've... –But I guess it wasn't like that. –No, it wasn't. He wasn't. We'd best go in. Marry me, Meghann. Up so late, Mom? I wanted to get this summary report in order for Father Ralph. We've really come back very strongly since the fire. Maybe even stronger than ever. I think Ralph will be quite surprised. –Is he back from Greece? –No. In fact, I had a letter just today. Quite an announcement. He's off to the Vatican with that... The one with the name a yard long. Ralph's to be made a Bishop. So who knows if he'll ever be back to Australia. The Vatican. –That's nice. –Nice? –I thought you'd be pleased for him. –Of course, I'm pleased. It's what he always wanted, isn't it? It's just that I've got my own announcement to make. I'm going to marry Luke O'Neill. What I wouldn't give if she were yours instead of Luke's. God knows how much I've hurt you. But I do love you. –Meghann's my wife, not yours! –Then be a husband to her, man! I tried to forget you with someone else! Two lives on a collision course with destiny. I've tried so hard to get her out of my heart. The Thorn Birds continues. Subtitles conformed by SOFTITLER English ⬄25000÷1000⬄ From the outback of Australia... comes a turbulent saga that spans the decades. Fire. Fire on Drogheda. Colleen McCullough's best-selling novel: The Thorn Birds. The story of an ambitious priest, a beautiful woman... and a love that lasts a lifetime. You can marry me. You love me. But I love God more. His ambition took him from the woman he loved... to the corridors of power. Her desire brought her to a man who could take his place. God, you are beautiful. Ralph's to be made a Bishop. I've got my own announcement to make. I'm going to marry Luke O'Neill. And tonight, the story continues. I'll never have what I really want. With no home, no babies. No husband, for that matter. And Meggie's fighting back the only way she can. Meghann, what have you done to me? What I wouldn't give if she were yours instead of Luke's. Meghann's my wife, not yours. God knows how much I've hurt you, but I do love you. You haven't the least idea what real love is! I'm not going to waste the rest of my life dreaming of a man I can never have. Forgive me. No more. Christopher Plummer, Piper Laurie, Earl Holliman... Ken Howard, Mare Winningham... Philip Anglim, Jean Simmons... Bryan Brown, Rachel Ward... and Richard Chamberlain. A love unattainable... forbidden forever: The Thorn Birds. I wonder what Ralph will think... when I write that you've married a Protestant. What difference does it make? I'm doing what he wanted, aren't I? Mom... I'd really rather you didn't write. I'll send Father Ralph a letter about it as soon as we settle in Queensland. All right, if you prefer. The Minister's going. I'd best go down. I'll miss you, Meggie. If you don't stop, you'll have me crying as well... and how would that look? –I'm a silly old goose. It's just that Queensland seems so far away. It's not forever, and I'll be home to visit. It's just that Luke can earn so much more cutting cane in Queensland. I suppose that means you'll be able to buy your own sheep station that much sooner. That's right. And just think... I'll have a new home of my own to take care of. And I'll have children one day. I've just got to have something of my own... something real that I can care about. Meggie, darling. And I need Luke. He's not one of those complicated men... who'll always be wanting something more than he wants me. Luke loves me, Mrs Smith. Truly, he does. £14·000? Why, that's more than a lot of squatters are worth. I had no idea. What, she didn't tell you? Oh, Lord. That's Meggie. No more idea than a child about such things. Ralph gave us money when the Church inherited Drogheda. Father de Bricassart. He oversees the estate for the Church. I've transferred Meggie's money to the bank in Dungloe... and put it in your name. I want you to know how much I appreciate the way you Clearys have treated me. I don't have much, but what I do have is Meghann's. And you can be sure I'll never touch a penny of this except to buy us a station. And I'll take good care of her. You have my word on that. Come on, you two! Goodbye, Pete. –All the best, Meggie. –Thanks, Alastair. Be happy, Meggie. Come on, Meghann, we'll miss our train. Your Eminence. Eminence? I think I'm not quite accustomed yet to being a cardinal, Ralph. I'm almost rather startled when you call me that. You will see what I mean... when first you are addressed as My Lord Bishop de Bricassart. But I trust you're ready for it. I hope that I am... and that I can be worthy of it. My dear Ralph. Often when I speak to you of your progress in the Church... I do so in ways that sound worldly... even cynical. I do not fully understand you yet. Perhaps I never shall. But I have never doubted... that your life is dedicated to God. Nor do I doubt that in making you My Lord Bishop today... the Church will bring you... the greatest happiness you have ever known. Luke, look. It's like paradise. It's Queensland, love. –Luke, what on earth are they doing? –They're burning up the cane. Drives out the rats and snakes, makes it easier for the fellows to get at. Smells wonderful, doesn't it? That's what you'll be doing? –That's coolie labor. –Coolie labor? Queensland cutters are the finest in the world, the elite. I'll be a lucky lad if my old mate, Arne, will hire me. He will, if he wants a good worker. I can earn 10 times as much in that cane as I ever could at Drogheda. And that means we'll be able to buy a place that much sooner. So if I have to be a coolie now, then I will. Because one day, Mrs O'Neill, I intend to be the headpin... out on the best sheep station in the whole of Western Queensland. I'm sorry. Forget it, love. First time and all. –Does it always hurt so much? –Never got any complaints before. I'm just so tired. –Three days on the train and then the bus. –I know. And this wet heat makes it worse when you're not used to it. Tell you what. You have a nice nap, and I'll go and see Arne. Then we'll both look at Dungloe together. Tell me about Arne Swenson. You haven't said a word. Should've seen his face when I told him I was married. –Couldn't believe I'd do it to him. –Does he have a job for you? –Only £20 a week, starting tomorrow. –£20? That's wonderful. Tomorrow? We don't even have a house yet. I suppose I could look for one by myself. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. See, Arne's gang works six days a week, up and down the coast. They live in barracks, and I'll have to live with them. What am I supposed to do? –I don't want to stay here by myself. –Of course not, and I wouldn't want you to. Besides what sort of sense would that be? Paying rent on a place for just one person. I fixed up for you to stay with someone Arne knows. The Muellers. –Mrs Mueller needs help round the house... –Luke. You hired me out as a housemaid? You make it sound like the end of the world. You'll be on a big cane plantation. The Mueller's manage it. And they're nice people. I looked them over very carefully. I thought at least I'd make some kind of home for us. It's not as if we were destitute. We've got my £14·000. And that's to stay in the bank as our nest egg. The rest we can earn together. If we put our heads down and work hard, we'll have our own place in no time. –I just want us to have the best. –I know. But living in some stranger's house... never seeing you? –Of course, you'll see me. We'll have every Sunday together. Make up for the rest of the week. Come on, let's get back to the hotel. We got some honeymooning to do. Good life all right, cutting the sugar. Best life there is for the man that's up to it. And Luke, he's got the stuff to be a bloody good cutter... if he's not interfered with. Let's just hope Luke is bloody good enough... to make lots of money... because that's what he wants out of it. –Yeah, that's what I used to say. Look at this, Meghann. Didn't I say it was nice? There's plenty of cane, if that's what you mean. –Bye, Luke. –Come on, Luke. –Come on, say goodbye to your... –Bye, love. –See you Sunday. –She'll be waiting for you Sunday. Come, let's go. We are family now. Good day! Can you tell me where to find the manager? Thank you. Get those slobs off their behinds and on their feet or I'll find somebody who can. There's plenty looking for your job. Mr Mueller? I'm Meggie Cleary. Emanou! Emanou! Run. Run, comrades. The old world is right in front of you. Can you hear that ? Mystical young people, always more beautiful. They're dreaming about being happy idiots. You. Be salty, not sweet. I'll do whatever I have to do for your little sucker's face, old slithering straw mattress, You get wet for a handsome male like me. Don't you? You've got ears, but you're deaf. You got eyes, but you can't see. When the time comes, it will be too late for you to understand. Anyway, I'm not worried about your snotty kids, who are dazed by hashish and music. Cops are going to make them walk straight. Like it was before the cataclysm. I haven't brought you peace, but a sword. He who found his life, will lose it. And he who loses his life because of me will find it. Happy will be the upset ones, because they'll be comforted. Happy will be those who hunger for freedom, because they'll be filled. You are the light of the world. And you don't turn on a light to keep it hidden. I didn't come to abolish, but to accomplish. 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2... Think about your record. 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2... He promises to give a concert. He knows it's forbidden, he's dooming himself to death. We must be ready in time. This should not ever start again. We must catch him and break him, definitively. The Bunker is counting on us. They are on full alert: ten squads on the job. Do you realize that ? Come on. Chest... Breath... Come on. Don't bend over. Breath... Breath... 1, 2, 1, 2... It's the Bunker! I dreamt that... turtles... Shhhh! Cops are close. I can hear their fear. That is music! That's it. Cops are coming. I have to settle down. I can't at night. But if it were morning... Let there be light. You're too much. You're really too much. Are you crazy ? Help... You're insane... They say cops are coming closer. Do you think Topé is going to betray Emanou? He's going to do it for him, not against him. It's written. You're going to do what I order you to do. Or I'll throw your bearded guy to the sea. Not tonight. I don't want to do it. What's that? You don't want? I forgive you for rebelling. Should I kick you up to there? I'll give you a brandy tasting blow job, my legionnaire. Go ahead. Take the top of his minaret off. Make it snappy! Put all your arse into it! Slut! Milos is getting off! He got his brothel in the cemetery. He'll knock up Dila once again. But us, what we like is music! I can tell Emanou used to know this girl. I'm sure of it. It was the time he was working as a carpenter with his father. During daytime, because at night he was performing concerts. I've been told about the birth of Emanou. The cops didn't want anybody to perform subversive music. They really beat the shit out of us ! His mother, She was engaged with some guy called Joseph... ..before they started living together, she got pregnant by the effect of the Holy Spirit. There was a donkey and an ox inside the stable where he was born. That killed more idols-to-be than Herod had slaughtered innocent men. When he was born, it was said that they sang. "God be praised in Heaven. And peace on earth for good-willing men." Mary gave birth to her son, wrapped him in a piece of cloth, and put him in a manger, because there was no room elsewhere. He is so different. My son is divine. I see him so high, so far away. From the Orient, we have seen his hearth shine. And we came to worship him. After his birth, he grew up in wisdom, body height and in grace, along with God and men. I'll never be able to understand you. Whore for Milos, mystical ballet for Emanou. Your Emanou... It has been said: When they accept the violence of scandal... and of its illumination... the rain will come... You can't hear me. You only think about your tiny green slave's herd. I can feel your heart beating. I can feel the rhythm of your breathing on my skin. But you only think about Emanou. I'd like you to sleep on top of me. Like a seagull during siesta time. It's a boy! It's a boy. A birth in this fucking cemetery... It's the first time. Does that mean that life goes on? I believed that only turtles could give birth after a cataclysm. It's a boy. That's what she wanted! It's harder to find a place for a girl in a faggot society! Keep on jerking off! You were so beautiful in the fish tank. You looked like the girls from Sion, who were wearing a tiara on the day of their wedding. The rest of the band is starting to become nervous. They feel that the cops are coming closer. The hash isn't calming them down anymore. We should go away before the concert. Hear me? You have been speaking about this cemetery for years. The music and everything, but all we have seen is three junk cars managed by a former pimp. Yes, this concert is only a legend and this music is cutting off youngsters from reality. And the worst part is that cultured people like you are taking it all seriously. He wrote: "Let he who loves me follow me". But me Nobody loves me. Men of little beliefs! I've seen him before my eyes in the swimming-pool. I've seen him. On your marks! Get set, but be careful, no false start... Go! Seeing him walk on the water, the impressed men said: "What can he be, that even water obeys him?" When is he going to perform his concert? It isn't his time yet. I'm going to cook this omelet alone. Absolon does nothing else other than worshipping you. Tell her to help me. Absolon is right. It has been said that love comes before work. He's going off. Totally. So love gives beautiful wrinkles and work ugly blisters, huh? I'm off. I'm off. They won't get me. Dila. The place is closed. The police want to kill Emanou and make an example of his death. Don't listen to false prophets. It's the time of the beast. For five dollars only, everybody can fish cod. Hallelujah It's worse than the bomb. It's going to break our eardrums. With those moves she does... Same as a dove; the spirit came down to him and said: "My beloved son, I put all my trust in you." After holding a fast for 40 days and nights, the Devil took him with him to show him all the kingdoms and their glory. I promise you fame and glory. Take these wings and jump down. Fans are going to take you in their hands to avoid your feet being hurt. You will not tempt me! You will hold a fast for 40 days and nights. Now, make this stone turn to fire! Men need more than bread. I'll give you glory if while i'm filming you fall down to my feet and worship me. Vade retro satanas. When I was a kid... Hey, be careful. When I was a child, I was dreaming that naked slaves, who were only wearing a red towel, were teaching me philosophy. They were caressing your holy body, huh? Cleaning up your most dirty corners. I should eat him. Completely; to meld him and myself together. Things would be easier. Take care, pal, you must do what has been wrote. By the way, how did they met, Emanou and Dila? In a billion litres of water. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Our illustrious guests can use anything here. For true aesthetes... We are in Babylon. We have the greatest choices of character to offer you: Centurions in a state of grace, comforting Samaritan girls, adulterous women ready to be stoned to death, and fishermen from the lake of Tiberia. Everything is yours. Babylon is always on the cutting edge. Hallelujah! Not a light, not a soul. As usual! Stop complaining and train a bit. 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.... Come on. 1, 2, 1, 2. Jump! Make an effort. You're going to break every record. One more ghost cemetery. We'll never find the one where Emanou is hiding. That puts me down in the dumps. These are deserts forgotten by men. We'll never find who we're looking for. Come on. Jump. 1, 2, 1, 2. "Love each other"... Great solidarity, absolute availability! We should eradicate this chaos. Jump! Come on! I will crush them like cockroaches... Find their cemetery. Come on. Jump. 1, 2, 1, 2. He mustn't give this last concert. It would be chaos. The triumph of vice! Did you hear? Come. It was too much for him. He let himself be caught like a swallow. What a bad trip. Cops tailing you... To come upon the cops in a ghost cemetery... He must have been very stoned. He was going to the cemetery scared by the idea of never hearing music again Anyway the bloody coppers really snafued him. They really made a mess of him. It doesn't matter. Every single grain of sand is part of the cemetery. He wouldn't have been killed if you had been there. You are the resurrection. He who believes in you will never die. Get up, Lazarus. Stand up and walk. They've waited too long for their concert. Now they see miracles everywhere. I don't believe in this resurrection of Lazarus. Wait for the rain. It will never rain, sweety. Since the cemetery is there, and guys like me have been in charge of it, not a single drop of rain has fallen from the sky. It's going to rain. And Milos will be drowned. I'm fed up with you and your filthy animal. Listen carefully; If your God really existed, I would go and quietly spit on his boots, to make them shine. He really can do everything. Unless we all dreaming. Lazarus... Here, my darling... Come on... He told them: "A good tree can't bear bad fruit". As he was walking down a back-alley, a blind man came to him: "Be merciful, son of the light..." 1... Hold tight. 2... Again... 1... Lift it. 2... Come on. Don't be lazy. You have to lift more weights or you'll never break the record. Come on. Once more. Brush me, my love. Make it shine. I need it. My giant is crying. Don't even think about it. We are the authority. And anyway, I don't know you, sir. The Bunker to all squads: We haven't located Emanou yet. Don't forget he is a very dangerous anarchist. We must arrest him at once. His death must be an example for all his accomplices. I want to sleep. Smell my candelabra, Lasca. OK, but only once! Would I be able to buy the whole of humanity by myself? Without anybody's help. tell that to Centurion. Are you planning the future of your protégé? I'm planning the great sacrifice. Mine. I would be the real Savior. I would accomplish my task. And God knows it's a despicable task. In 2000 years, I'll be in the latrines of history. I don't understand a thing. But I used to know your friend very well He kicked me out of the Crazy Times... My temple. I'm the Devil. I'm the fallen angel. Go ahead Mr Topé. Drink some good coffee to forget your bad thoughts. What is easier? To tell a paralyzed person: "It's because of your sins," or to tell him: "Stand up, and walk." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The great ecstasy... You can buy or sell everything. And make the one of you who never sinned be the first to throw a stone at the slut who sells her body. You're in Babylon! Dila is held by her pimp, so she sells her body. But what about you? It's too hot to be in the game. And we're lacking music. You always preferred noise over being in the game. Noise is already music. The old ones are still in the race. They're all over the fucking place. Is there an available Chrystler, I'd like to take a nap. Over there. Do you now what he said the other day? "At the beginning, God created the sky and earth". Pretty, don't you think? The whole thing started like this? They had explained it to me in a more complicated way. All these stories about cosmos... He also said: "The everlasting God created man from the dust of the earth, and he blew in his hands the breath of life. And man became a living creature". I hope we can continue to have fun. He said: "We should be as children". It's going to be difficult. We'll try. He took off the bandages and she was cured. Hey, Topé. You know we are the last two who've kept their eyes open, in this last shelter that God shat accidentally after the cataclysm. I'm dreaming... about being attacked by tanks. They're firing at me. I'm in the midst of the two armies, totally naked and painted green. I'm slowly falling from the sky. Everybody hates my guts. And on top of that, they say I'm a paranoiac. When are they going to open? Two more miracles and that's it. Yeah... I split! I'm out of here. I'm fed up with all this. I should have never come here. I'll be fine when I'll be alone... There will be nobody there to contradict me. Nobody to see my weaknesses. How blissful. Farewell. Some lights, at least. This traitor, Topé, gave us fair information. We'll make a small celebration for Emanou. A nice celebration. Try this. OK. With this, they won't notice you. So. I'm on my way. It's not finished. You brought us to the cemetery, but... If you want, I can tell you a dream. My mother made me sit on a chair. The colonel was trying to make a hole in my head with a lancet. To remove the stone of madness. We still don't know where Emanou is hiding. Emanou? He will be at the forbidden concert tonight. He will be the one singing. I'm going now... You'll have your money only after. Cash money. I promise. I'm going now. Bye. We must call headquarters. There will be no concert. Don't you think we have better things to do? No, and no! It's no good for you and it will make you weak. Just a quickie. In your mouth. The "hula hoop" one is good for me. I told you no, and no! Anyway, we have no quiet place to go to. Hey! This time, I also had a dream. I dreamt that... I disowned him three times before the first cock crowed. Be good! Be pure! Emanou really makes miracles. Yes. To give music and dreams to thousands of people is a real miracle. He'll probably do it again. I hope he won't pay for all of us, and lose his life. Stop fucking knocking. I'm here. You'll break the car. Don't look at me like this, I'm a civil servant, but I'm not made of wood. I'm not like the others, my sweet... One more shagging couple. Mister and Madam, please follow me. We have a car that Mr will enjoy. Silent mattress, romantic and if you wish to play the mirror's game, my wife is at your disposal. Emanou! Emanou! Can you hear them? "Emanou! Emanou!" Actually... The best way to punish men is to give them what they ask for. No, old pal. They want to enjoy. Here and now. And during this time, Emanou is speaking about graciousness. I don't now... I want to shout at them: Fuck each other now, before he fucks you. Watch your ears: they have walls! What are you doing here? The concert is not starting yet. It'll start soon, but not yet. Topé, we must save Emanou. Somebody brought the cops in. I don't know who fingered him but... Milos looks happy. It's not good. I don't trust your lack of belief. Why? Because... You're crazy about his guy. I don't understand what's so great about him. On top of that, he's only talking insanities. He told me my eyes are the same as doves and my hair is the same as a flock of goats. My mouth is as a purple line. My neck is as the tower of David and my navel is as a wine filled cup. My breast is the siblings of a gazelle, sleeping in the lilies. It's going to rain. It's going to rain! This guy is awesome. I'll always be the first to stand beside him. The first one is Dila. A lot of firsts will be lasts. And a lot of lasts will be firsts. What's the use for men to win the world? If they win they destroy their own life. I won't be able stay here anymore after the concert. Later... Every time you eat bread, you will think about me. I just heard him! He was sitting at the table with his open-mouthed fans. "I'm not only the voice, the truth, and the life, I'm also love and freedom!", and so on... He's everything! How dares he! And then after, he had a great thought: "The absolute and without ulterior motive, renunciation of violence is the necessary condition to the survival of humanity". He's too much, huh? To be too much is like starting to create, no? When my dog was watching me sitting still in the shadows, he used to bring me a rabbit's foot. I was tying the foot with a string and making him run. He had strange jumps, it was funny. But one day, he stopped. He stared at me and I understood that he was bored of running and was doing it only to please me. What are you saying? I'm fed up with these parables of yours! Can you explain yourself just one fucking time? What's this dog story? Who is this dog? Is that you? Is that Emanou? I split... Hey! You know what he also said? That he was going to wash their feet! I'm going somewhere else. And I won't be coming back. And he said: "I won't be with you for much longer. You are going to cry, and to feel sorry, as a woman giving birth. But after she gives birth, she will forget the pain. I achieved the work I was supposed to do." I heard they are going to arrest Emanou. No. He's getting ready for the concert. It rained yesterday. I don't want you to touch me anymore. That's something new! I want to be a virgin for the concert. They're going to send the squads immediately! Not yet. There's more important things down here. And when it'll come, spread it all over, even on the ears! It's the last time. You're going to be sick! Once again! You're lecherous! Lewd! Fodère! Listen to him! Listen to me! It's fucking obvious! What he says is so simple. It's so simple even a five year old kid could understand. Excuse me but, the two concert organizers are here for you. For me? Yes. They fuck so much they don't know what that's all about, anymore. The concert is going to start, you must call the Bunker. We must be ready when Topé fingers him. One more time. Just one more, I swear. Do me the same as last. And press with your thumbs. It's burning me. OK. But it's the last time. Don't ask me anything after that. Fuck ! Stop that. Have you seen this little prick? What do you want? He's a real pain in the ass, isn't he, Lasca? What? I you want to catch him, it's now or never. I'll go close to him... and I'll kiss him... And he's yours. We'll give you the money only at this moment. Go now. Hey! Listen to me! Hey! Calm down calm down I need to speak. Your Emanou is going to come, to give a forbidden concert. But, don't destroy what belongs to the community, you social misfits. I dreamt... You dream too much, and always about the same thing. Always about the garden of delights. And you spread apart while people stick roses up your arse. Piss off, Fodère. You'll never understand anything. You're not an artist. You're a lout. It's hard to redeem humanity all by yourself. You want me to tell you the truth? Your concert will never happen. And I'm sure they're going to pay me with a rubber cheque. They'll never understand me. I will be misunderstood. History is going to rip me to shreds. Tiossido and Lasca calling for the Bunker. Can you read me? We have found the place where Emanou is hiding. I'm on my way. Mystical young woman... Always more beautiful... And Emanou said: "You send them prophets and apostles, and they will persecute them. Father, why did you abandon me? The time has come. I'll drink the chalice to the dregs but I'd like it to be quick." Emanou is coming to give his concert! He unveiled all the secret things since the creation of the world. He is the light and the one who'll follow him will leave all darkness. With him, I feel as protected as a little girl under a mushroom. He is our horizon, our dream! They knelt him down and they flagellated him. I fingered the son of man by a kiss. They didn't pay me cash as agreed, but with a rubber cheque. It's my sacrifice that will save them. But they'll never understand. They put a crown of thorns on his head. According to the custom, they could release a prisoner, and there was a famous one, a bandit called Barabal, who invented a torture place called a 'gulag'. Who are you going to save? Barabal or Emanou? Barabal! Barabal! But he had said: "My kingdom is not of this world." They drew lots for his clothes. This is how what was told was fulfilled, they shared his clothes. And he proclaimed: "Eli Eli, lema sabachtani?" which means: "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?" He left earth and was taken to heaven.

Come on, you're late! - l'll talk to you later. - Fatima! - Why are you late? - My Rolls got towed away. Don't play, we've got people here. If I gave you $1 ,000,000 would you be mad at me? - Sure! - You would? Still? That's a beautiful dress you've got on. It is. You know, I can see them... Sexy. How about a quarter, as a down payment on that $1 ,000,000? Think I won't keep it? I will keep it. Believe that. I know you will take it. There you go. One, two, three four, five, six, seven, eight.

Look in the mirrors at yourselves. You got attitude. You got strength. Attitude, come on... Molly, watch your line. Be proud! You're dancers. You love dancing. That's it. We've got potential here. We've got real potential. Any messages? Any messages? - Hey, Tony, how's your love life? - All right. - You know why I order so many drinks? - You're an alcoholic. No. Because I love to watch your walk. - Oooh, oooh! I like that! - Great walk. How are you, Margaret? Freddie, where's my order? Coming up. Some of your groupie friends are here. - Who? - Those friends of yours. - They're acquaintances. - How about sharing the wealth? - Am I your booking agent? - You don't want to share? I don't need your hand-me-downs. - Have you got emotional problems? - You think I need a shrink? - How late are you working tonight? - Till three. - Want to come over? - Last time, I almost got brain damage. You party too hard. You ought to be a tag team. Good guys are hard to find. Why don't you try the army? - Are we on later? - No, I can't make it. Why not? - Lately, I've been career oriented. - What's that mean? I don't have time for relationships right now. That right? Well, let me tell you something. Guys like you aren't relationships, you're exercise. - Why do you have to go? It's only six. - l want to get something going today. - Don't you want to stay for breakfast? - No, I'm not hungry. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I just want to get something going today. - You will. - l'll see you later. - l'll miss you. - You don't have to say that, Jackie. I know I don't. I'm a dancer by nature. I studied for four years and now I teach. - But I'm very available for TV work. - No. Good day. Acting roles... I do dramatic parts. I can do comedy roles. I'd consider doing a soap opera or even a roadshow, a musical of some sort. I would consider doing a print ad. If you're looking for the outdoor type, I'm good at some sports, like weightlifting and stickball and push-ups, and... lf absolutely necessary, I don't mind doing any kind of extra work. Except I promised my mother I'd never do any nudity. I guess she's afraid that I might get a cold. But the fact still is, I'm a dancer by nature. Whatever. Yeah, whatever. It's like you're invisible. They make you feel like you're wasting your time. What's really weird is that they all sound like my father used to. Why be down on yourself? You know what you can do. - What about you? - What about me? You've been doing choruses for six years. Don't you want to do something that's all you? - lf it happens, good. lf not, too bad. - How could you think that way? A woman's dancing career is half as long as a man's. So I have half as many chances as you of making it. - l've got to be real with myself. - l don't know, I guess so. Mm...cherry. - See you later. - Will you come tonight? - lt's the last show. - l don't think I can make it. - Why the excuses? - What excuses? Don't play this competition thing with me. Just because you're in a show and I'm not, that ain't competition. - Well, what is it? - Envy! Will you be there? Got any messages? It's an inside joke. - Tony! - Hey, Jackie! You were great! - Are you sure? - l'm positive. You was fantastic. - l was nervous knowing you were here. - You shouldn't have been. - Are you sure I was OK? - You were great. - l'll change. Will you wait? - Yeah. - l'll meet you outside. - Sure, why not? Hi. Yes? I wanted to tell you I think you're an incredible dancer. Thank you very much. I'm a friend of Jackie Coll's. Tony Manero. - lt's important to have friends. - l was saying that over breakfast. Did you want something? An autograph, or something? I'd like to get together and talk some time. Would that be possible? - About what? - About how incredible you are. - Thank you, but I already know that. - Say what? I already know. I used to be incredible myself when I lived in Brooklyn. - Really? What happened? - l moved to Manhattan. So, where exactly are you imported from? The vicinity of England? - Very good. - See? I know. - So what do you do? - l'm sort of into telling the future. - Great things will happen for you. - Oh, really? What great things? You're going to meet this really, really sensitive, nice type of guy. Once you get to know him, you're going to be crazy about him. - l am? - Yeah! So where is he? I'll go get him. You just wait here. You'll love him. He's great. Hey, Rico! She's waiting to see you. Really! Come on, she's great! Really! No, I'll get him. I got her here. She's nice. No problem. You'll love her. Come on... Wait! Well, come on. - lt didn't happen. - Imported, indeed! - How are you doing? - Strong draught in there, huh? - Come in. - You nearly broke my face with the door. I'm giving you my best come-ons and you try to mangle my face. - Well, Jimmy, you see... - Tony! Whatever. You seem to take pleasure in treating women as incredibly stupid. If you're mad at me, I apologise. I thought I was being charming. You did try to damage my head. But the thing is that I... I amazingly respect your dancing talent. And your womanhood. I didn't always respect womanhood, but since I moved to Manhattan, I got this new, mature outlook. I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't curse. Anyway, I would like to take you out. Maybe we could have a drink, maybe have some dinner. And... But someplace informal, because my suits are all being pressed. Well, thank you but I have to go home early tonight. - We're auditioning for the new show. - Are you in it? - Definitely. Are you a dancer? - Yeah, couldn't you tell? Oh, of course. Why don't you come by tomorrow? - l could put in a good word for you. - No, don't do that. Please. I really don't need any help in that department. - OK. - Are you sure you can't go out tonight? Sorry. Well, if I don't see you any more, nice meeting you and being insulted by you. My pleasure. - Aren't you coming tomorrow? - l knew you wanted to see me again. Taxi! - Want to eat? - l got to get to the club. - Why do you work at that club? - Extra money. - There's an audition tomorrow. - l told you a week ago. - Really? - Yeah. You'll audition, won't you? Why not? Rejection's a hobby now. Oh, listen to you! Small world, isn't it? Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Do you know her? - Just informally. - How did you meet her? She was passing. I said she was an OK dancer. You told her she's OK! - Something to that effect. - She's a great dancer! - Whose is the limo? - l think it belongs to her. - She comes from money. - Really? is she heavily involved with someone? What do you mean? Has she got a lot of guys drooling over her? I don't want to hear if you're hot over somebody. I just respect her dancing. Did you hear the way she talks? It's so intelligent. I love it. An accent doesn't make you intelligent. If it did, you'd be Einstein. Jackie, I'm not trying to make you jealous. You're a good dancer. - What can I say? - Don't play these games. - What games? - l'll see you tomorrow. Come on, I don't even know her! Are you sure you don't want something to eat? Manero, you've got a way with words! Very good. Excellent! Just in case you've got to hear it again, it's whoever's right for the show. Michelle, Tracy... Smitty... Karen, yes... Sorry. Jackie, you worked real hard. Yes. - OK, that's it. Next group! - OK, men please! - Hi, I'm Joy. - l'm happiness. I bet you are. I'm the assistant choreographer. Any questions regarding the routine, please ask me now. Listen up! This time, try the whole combination right through to the end. If I don't see you again, you got beautiful legs. - So do you. - Listen up! If you've finished dancing, move off stage! You're always causing trouble. Get out of here! OK, now get ready. Joy, count it down. OK, music! That's good. That's enough, thank you. We need pictures, résumés, phone numbers. We'll get back to you. You were all excellent, but I only need two. Thank you. Hello, Jimmy. - lt's Tony! - Oh, whatever. - l know what you must be thinking. - Do you? They'll call. Don't worry. Whatever. - You were very good. - Thank you. - l mean it. - Really? - Yeah. - Sounds like you appreciated me. Yes, you could say that. - Could I ask you something? - What? If you appreciate me and I appreciate you, how about getting together and we could appreciate each other? - Appreciate? - Yeah, like for many hours. I have a singing lesson I'll have to cancel. That's all right. I got a dance class I'd have to cancel. And then I'd have to cancel my manicure. I'd have to cancel my meeting with the mayor. And then I'd have to cancel my yoga class. That's all right. I'd have to cancel my brain operation. Do you think that's a good idea? Laura, are you rich or something? I told you, it isn't important. - Why? is it some secret? - lt's just furniture. Come on! You'd have to work 1 0 shows to afford this. Oh, shush. - Look, we had a good time. - What? Did I miss something here? I changed the subject. We had a good night. We had a great night. Great night. I want to tell you something. You don't know me well. And with my past, I don't respect many people. - But I do respect you. - Oh. Thank you. And when you dance, oh, man, I could watch you for hours. Really! - lt's like watching smoke move. - l know. It's like you've done something with your life. You're significant. I think it's time we said goodnight. - What's wrong? - Nothing! It's just 3.00. - And I've got to rehearse tomorrow. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - Definitely? - Yeah. - Oh, no, this is a flash. You can't... - l've never been asked to leave. - Don't take it personally. - l've got to! There's nobody else here! - That's true. Well... Definitely? This is it? I mean, tonight, it's over, that's it? Oh, no! Oh, Tony, you don't think that, do you? Do you? It's just until tomorrow. - Hello? - Jackie! Tony? Where are you? I'm making sure the streets are safe for women and children. - Somebody`s got to do it. - Are you OK? - Great! Are you alone? - What? Are you alone? is there a vacancy next to you? - There's a vacancy. Why? - l was just curious. Why are you up so late? A professional should watch her health. I'll see you tomorrow if I don't drown. That boy is strange. Ring. Don't touch that phone! Get off! Yes! Yes, this is Tony Manero. Are you kidding? Hold on a second... Turn down the radio! I got it? You're kidding? - That boy is crazy. - When do I start? What time? Where? All right! Thank you! Thank you! I'll be there! Way to go, Manero! - Hello? - Ma. Tony! Well, it's about time I hear from you. Guess what? I got a job on Broadway! You got a job on Broadway? Doing what? - Dancing! Don't you remember I dance? - No nudity, I hope! Keep your clothes on. You hear me? - You hear me? - Come on, come off it. - How are you doing? - l'm all right, I'm fine! OK. I'll call you later and tell you all the details. OK, bye-bye. I love youse. I got to change my residence. I hope we never change lf you feel the same Time will make us so much stronger You give it all to me I give it back to you We give our love to one another Waking up with my eyes open wide Waking up, you`re still sleeping by my side You`ve been the heart of me You`ve been the one See here. Sit yourself down. You're the only one I've got, Maurice. You love me, don't ya? Hold me tight, Maurice, please. Sweetheart! My little brother. Look at you. It's a good life for ya. When are you gonna shave, eh? Slap your arse. Why don't you chuck it all out, eh? I mean, look at it. Some of it hasn't been touched since Mum died. Can you use anything, Maurice, in your new house? Fill a space? No, thanks. Thought I might move in here. Front view. See the world go by. Remember this? Yeah. Now it's no use to you, is it? I don't think so. You ain't gonna make me an auntie now, are ya? Sweetheart? Listen, Cynth... I... b-bet... better be going. You'll let me know about the barbecue then, will you, sweetheart? Yeah, of course I will. Tell her if she can't make it, I'll give her a clump. - Not before I do. - Hang on. - Shall I say hello to Monica for you? - If you like, sweetheart. - There you go. - Thanks, darlin'. - See ya. - Ta-ta. What was your mum like when your dad died? - What do you mean? - How did she cope? I don't know. Too young to remember. She just got on with it, I suppose, like everybody else. Did you have to look after Craig? What, you mean like your big sister looked after you? No, I did not. My dad never said a word about my mum after she died. - That's men for you. - I hated him for it. He must have been in real pain. Maybe just couldn't share it. I didn't know what I felt. I still don't. Cynthia's antics couldn't have helped him much. - Do you miss Craig? - Why would I miss Craig? - He's your brother. - He's in Saudi Arabia, isn't he? Yeah. Well, I don't exactly miss him. Why? Do you miss Cynthia? Do you think Roxanne's serious about this scaffolder bloke? Well, she's only known him for five minutes. Mind you, I was married at her age, wasn't I? - Yeah. - I wonder if she knows. What, about us? - What's there to know about us? - You know what I mean. How would she know about that... unless you've told her. - I haven't told her. - I hope Cynthia doesn't know either. She doesn't. That's all right then. No, I meant if she knows about Cynthia... You know, before she was born. I don't know. I mean, she's got a half-brother or a half-sister, knockin' about somewhere. - She's got a right to know. - That's up to Cynthia. You'd never say anything, would you? - Of course not. - Good. Anyway, she must have told her. She never told her who her father was. None of us knew who he was. I wonder if she ever misses him. - Who? - Roxanne. - You can't miss what you've never had. - Can't you? I was gonna kill him. - Poor Cynthia. - Saint Cynthia. - She tried her best. - Did she? Yeah. Yeah, she did. She gave me a lot of love. - What shall I tell him if he phones then? - Who? - Maurice. - I don't know. Tell him what you want. - Are you gonna bring your bloke or not? - No, I ain't. - Have you asked him? - No! Hello? - That will be him now. - Hello? - Let me talk to him. - Shut it! Well, there ain't no one there. - One of them perverts. - Sweetheart? Oh, will you stop going on about this fucking barbecue? You're going to see him now, ain't you? You can ask him. I don't even know if I want him to go... and it ain't for ages anyway. See you later. - "I, Zoe, - "I, Zoe... - "take you, Darren, - "take you, Darren... - "to be my husband, - "to be my husband... - "to have and to hold... - "to have and to hold... - "from this day forward, - "from this day forward... - "for better or for worse, - for better or for worse..." For richer..." Darren and Zoe have given their consent... and made their marriage vows to each other. They have declared their marriage by joining of hands... and by the giving and receiving of rings. I therefore proclaim... that they are husband and wife. Ain't you seein' him tonight then? I'm havin' an early night. - Keep me company? - I've got a hangover. You should stop in more often. You are lookin' after yourself with him, ain't you, sweetheart? - What you mean? - You know, taking care. I don't want to ask you nothing personal, darling... but are you taking the pill? That is personal. - Why don't you bring him 'round? - Leave it out. I'd like to meet him. I wouldn't know him... - if he stood up in me soup. - Don't hold your breath. You don't want to leave it up to him, darling. Men are all the same. - Mum! - I hope he uses a what's-name... - Condoms. - Mind your own business. They can leak. You want to be careful. You're jealous, ain't ya? Where is he tonight anyway? - I don't know. - Most likely out giving somebody else one. That's how I got caught with you... running' out of the pill. - You could have a coil fitted. - Change the record! Dr. Mulholland, make an appointment. - You'd suit the sponge. - Keep your voice down! I got a Dutch cap floating' around somewhere upstairs. You could have that. Run it under the tap.

They've made a mistake down in the offices. You want to get down there, get that sorted. - That's someone having' a joke. - I don't think so. Let me have a look at that. I'm ever so sorry, sweetheart. That must be a bit of a disappointment for you. Look, I really think you ought to see these documents. Why, what is it? Why don't we, uh, go somewhere and have a sit-down? No, I think I better be going, darlin'. Look, you've come all this way. Please. Let's... Let's go and have a cup of tea or something.

My daughter smokes like a chimney. - You got a daughter? - Yeah. I ain't never been in here before. They shouldn't go raisin' your hopes like that. It ain't fair. Is this your signature?

I didn't know, sweetheart. Honest, I didn't know. - What didn't you know? - I didn't know you was black. See, I... I thought they got the dates all wrong. All this time, I thought you was born six... six weeks premature... but you weren't. You wasn't. Who was he? You don't wanna know that, darlin'. I do. Listen, I wanna be honest with you but I can't tell you THAT, sweetheart, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look at ya. I expect I'm a bit of a disappointment to you, ain't I? No. You don't have to say that, darlin'. I know. You've been better off without me, I can tell you that much. I done you a good turn. Your tea's getting cold. What's your mum like, then? Does she mind you lookin' for me? - My mum died recently. - Oh, I'm sorry. What about your dad? He's dead an' all. Oh. Are you married? No. No, um... I ain't, er... I ain't married, sweetheart. Are YOU? No. I bet you got a boyfriend. - No, not at the moment. - Nice-looking girl like you? Have YOU got a boyfriend? I give 'em all a wide berth. They got me into enough trouble in the past! You got a job, have you? Yeah. That's good. What doing'? - I'm an optometrist. - Eh? I test eyes. Optician? Are you? Well... There's a turn up. - What do YOU do? - I work in a factory. D'you like it?

Well, 'cause nobody knows about you, sweetheart. I don't wanna upset my daughter, do I? I mean when I was born. Well, I couldn't. I was too upset, see. They wanted me to look at you. They wanted me to hold you but I couldn't. I just couldn't! I didn't know if I was comin' or goin'. I was only a little girl meself, 16. I didn't have no choice. If I had've seen you, I would've wanted to keep you. You do believe me, don't you, sweetheart? I don't blame you, darlin'. You only just found out? No. I've known since I was seven. Your mum and dad told you, did they? Yeah, they did. They sound like nice people. Yeah. My mum told me on the plane on our way back from Barbados. Little girl. Was you upset? I just looked out at the clouds. Haven't you ever thought about me? Yeah, 'COURSE I have! But it ain't no good pinin' over what you ain't got, is it? But didn't you think I'd look for you? No, I... I didn't, as it happens. Wish you hadn't bothered now, don't you? No. I'm glad. I don't want to disrupt your family or anything. I just had to see you. I had to know who you were. Listen... I wanna wish you all the best, sweetheart, whatever you do. And I'll be thinkin' of you. Bit quiet, ain't ya? What's up? You goin' out? Yeah, in a bit. You feelin' all right? There's nothing the matter with ME. Nothing at all. - D'you find anything today? - Frozen chicken. - What, in the road? - No, in a bin. It was still cold. Some dirty magazines. D'you bring 'em home? No! Still, I suppose there are worse jobs. Gotta laugh, ain't you, sweetheart? Else you'd cry. Hello. Is that Hortense? 'Speaking. ' It's Cynthia. Hello. 'I didn't think you'd be in. ' I am. Well, I just, um... wanted to ring up and say... how nice it was to meet you yesterday. That's all. Thank you. Been thinkin' about you all day. I've been thinking about YOU. Yeah, well, um... I just wanted to say that. Thank you. Dunno what to say now. Daft, ain't it? Got home all right, did you? Yeah. Thank you. What have you been doin' today? Oh, just out the back, sunning' meself. 'What YOU been doin'? ' Just chillin' out, really. 'Yeah, hot, ain't it? ' Yeah. Well, that's all I wanted to say, sweetheart. Tada, then. I'd really like to see you again. - Would you? - Yeah. That'd be nice. D'you like Italian food? Yeah, eat anything, me. Chinese, kebabs, the lot! 'What? ' Nothing. It's great. And... OK, other side, please. And... Bring your face this way, please. Can you shut the door, please? Yeah, sure. Sorry. So who did your original photographs? My dad, actually, but my solicitor said they weren't good enough. D'you have a police photographer? No. I'm gonna come in a bit closer. Hope you don't get claustrophobia. No, I don't, actually. That's good. OK. I'm just gonna move your... Thank you. Sorry. That's great. And... Lovely. A little bit closer. Now... I know this isn't very nice. But it's gotta be done, hasn't it? I want 'em to look as bad as possible. Of course. I lost my job. I was GOOD at my job. What did you do? I'm a beauty consultant. OK. If you just bring your chin up. Lovely. And... So what actually happened to you? My seatbelt was broken. I went through the windscreen. It wasn't my car. I wasn't driving. It wasn't my fault. - Yeah, you said. - It wasn't! You OK? Mm. Did the driver sustain any injuries? No, unfortunately. He's not in your good books. I ain't seen him since. I don't wanna see him. Life isn't fair, is it? Someone always draws the short straw. OK, that's very good. Yeah. One more. - Here's your receipt. - Thank you. Ring us in the morning. We'll see what we can do. - Fine. - Bye, then. Mind how you go! Oh, Maurice, that's terrible. - How'd she do that, then? - Car crash. - Aw, she's so lovely. - Not any more, she isn't. It's tragic. She's getting earhole from that dosser. He's been lookin' at me. Gives me the creeps. I don't believe it. How much money d'you think she'll get? - What? - Insurance. Oh, if she's lucky - 15, 20 grand. I dunno what I'd do if it happened to me. Think I'd kill meself. - Hello. - Hiya. Didn't expect to see YOU. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Hello, Monica. Hi, Jane. Just been for a facial. I'm dying for a cup of tea. - Look over there. - What? - That bloke. - What bloke? See who it is? - What, by the lamppost? - Yeah. It's Stuart Christian, isn't it? No! It IS. - But he's in Sydney. - Is he? He's comin' over. Doesn't look well, does he? It's that man. - It's OK. We know him. - Do ya? - What's he want? - God knows. - It's over to you, buster. - Thanks very much(! ). Hello, Stuart. Maurice. Long time, no see. Yeah. How's things? Fine, thanks. Fine. Good. You're lookin' well. You're still 'ere then. Yup. Good. I thought we'd lost you to Australia. Well... How's the wife and kids? Maureen. Monica. Haven't got any kids. - No? - She's great, thanks. Good on you, mate. - You still in the game? - Look at all this! What are you doin'? It's lost its style, Maurice. Has it? Looks like a dentist's waiting room. I'd kill for a cup o' tea. If you're 21... or a millionaire... it's great. Or you've got nine kids... you're fine. Brilliant. Open arms. But for guys like you and me, doesn't matter how good you are - forget it. But it was an experience... and now I'm back. That's too bad. You were full of such big plans. It's a big place. - That's true. - Too fuckin' big. You're lookin' as gorgeous as ever, Monica. You thinkin' about setting up again? No, forget it. Too much of a pain. You know what it's like, Maurice. You sweat your balls off for years and try and make people happy. And what d'you get back? Nothing! (Thanks.) By the way, this is Jane, my assistant. I bought the business from Mr Christian. - Hello. - Hello, Jane. I hope he's treatin' you well. He's all right. You can work for me any time. I'm all right where I am, thank you. Your wife must've been sorry to come back. Which wife? Ah, that bitch. She never came out there in the first place. Oh. - So where you living now? - Down in Grays. - Essex. - Yeah. - Me mum's place. - Must be nice for her. - Havin' her boy to fuss over. - She's dead. She died when I was in Bangkok. Aw! - Sorry to hear that. - That's a shame. Didn't see much of her anyway. It's my dad I miss. You win some, you lose some. You must've had some lovely weather in Australia. Too hot. It's too hot over there, it's too cold over here. Hasn't changed much in here. Just a lick of paint. Still got the Bronika, then? Yup. I should've thought you'd be able to afford a Hasselblad by now, Maurice. I can. Oh, well off, are you? Survivin', mate, yeah. Yeah. You've done well out of my business, haven't you? MY business. It's MY business. No. I bought it from you. It's MY business. - This was an antiques shop. - That's right. There was nothin' here. - I know. - I gave you my goodwill, I gave you my clientele, I gave you my fucking reputation. You gave me nothing, Stuart. - Your client list was shit. - It wasn't. I followed it up. I rang 'em, I didn't get one bite. If there's any success in this shop, - it's down to me. - That's bollocks! It's not bollocks, it's the truth. - How many weddings do you do? - Enough. - How many? - About 40 a year. - I used to do 140! - What, personally? No. Nobody does 'em personally. - I do. - Then you're a bloody fool. Get people in. If the work's there, grab it while you can. I'm not getting some tosser in. He could fuck up my reputation. - I'm not a tosser! - I didn't say you were. - I'm not a fucking tosser. - I didn't mean you. - Don't call me a tosser. - I didn't, Stuart. I can still do it! I've still got an eye. They can't teach you that. - I'm still a photographer! - 'Course you are. So if you want someone to help you out, no worries, mate. I'll be all right. Right, right. I see what you're saying, Stuart, yeah. I'll bear it in mind. You could lend me a camera? Yeah, sure. I had mine nicked. Yeah, great. Thanks. Sure. I thought we were never gonna get rid of him. There but for the grace of God. Tea's on the table. Right. Ain't you havin' none? No. Why not? I'm goin' out. Where you goin'? I'm off now then, sweetheart. Ain't you gonna tell me where? You never tell me where YOU'RE goin'. You never go nowhere. I'm going somewhere tonight. Tada. - Have fun. - Don't wait up. She's been actin' right funny. Where's she gone? Fuck knows. She wouldn't tell us. He's all right, though, Maurice. Always got plenty of wine in. - We'll get well pissed. - Nice one. I'm a bit shy of you, to tell you the truth. Of me? Oh, you shouldn't be. Look at you sittin' there. You look like a model. Oh, do I? I'll bet you was a pretty little girl. Yeah, lovely. Don't do that! You'll stay like it. Stop it! Don't spoil it. I used to drive my mum mad pulling' faces. Bet she was a laugh, wasn't she? No, not really. Thought you said she was a midwife. Yeah. I'd like to have been one of them. I love babies. - I'm sorry, darlin'. - It's all right. Cheers. Cheers. Is that all right for you? Yeah, it's lovely. Wet, ain't it? Where's this food, then? I'm ravishin'! What? I've got so many things I wanna ask you but I can't remember what they are. Nice to have someone to talk to, innit? Give us your hand, here. Oh, you've got beautiful skin. Right, let's have a look at you. What, can you read palms? I used to. Ain't done it for years. Nobody's interested no more. Now, if I didn't know you, I could see by lookin' here what a nice girl you are. Big heart. You're gonna live to a ripe old age an' all. Let's have a look. Couple of kids. D'you want babies? - I'm not sure, really. - Oh, don't ya? - Maybe. I dunno yet. - Yeah, 'course you do. Star sign? Leo. I'm on the cusp of Cancer. When's your birthday? Oh, 23rd of July. You'd think I'd know that, wouldn't ya? - That was the other day. - Yeah. Sunday. Why didn't you say nothing when I phoned ya? It's no big deal. Did you have a party? - No. - What d'you do, then? Stayed in, read me book, had a drink. - What, on your own? - Yeah. Aw. Well, happy birthday for Sunday, sweetheart. Thank you. You're out now, ain't you? Yeah. In good company. With your mum. You thought about havin' driving lessons? What for? I could get you some for your birthday. Don't be stupid. Get yourself a little motor, eh? Ain't you goin' out tonight? - No. - Why? What's happened? - YOU goin' out? - Yeah, later. - Where you goin'? - Down the pub. I hope you're taking care of yourself. What? Don't wanna get knocked up. - Don't be so bloody cheeky. - Not at your age. - All right? - Missed a bit, darlin'. Who's this? Oh, don't start all that again! Come on, who is it? - It ain't me, is it? - No! Well, who? Sylvester Stallone. I can't understand a word he says. You like lookin' at him, though. No, he ain't my sort. - What IS your type? - What, film star? - Yeah. - Marlon. I like a bloke with a bit of meat on him. What sort of bloke do YOU go in for, then? Oh. Intelligent... sensitive... Don't you care what they look like? Yeah, but they've gotta have something going on upstairs. You only have black boyfriends, do you? No. How do YOU look after yourself, then? You know, if you don't wanna have babies. Condoms. You just stop at that, do you? Yeah. It's the best way. - Can't be too careful. - Gotta protect yourself. It's my daughter's birthday next week. - How old is she? - 21. Nice age. She's your sister now, ain't she? Yeah. Suppose she is. Does she look like you? Yeah, a bit. You look more like me than SHE does. We're the same build. What are her eyes like? Blue. My brother's doin' a party for her. That's nice. It takes the strain off you. Yeah, well. There is that. - Shame YOU ain't comin'. - Ah. Meet your new family. - Oh, sweetheart! - What? I nearly forgot! Happy birthday for Sunday. It's... Oh, you shouldn't have bothered. It ain't nothing much. Aw. Aw, thank you. Don't start crying. Perhaps I should ask him. - What? - If I can take someone. I don't know. It's a family thing. You're family, ain't ya? I'm proud of you. Listen, Maurice, sweetheart - I wanted to ask you a favour. 'Oh, yeah? What's that, then? You know the party Sunday? 'Barbecue. Yeah. ' Yeah. Can I bring a mate? Sweetheart? Hello? Is it a bloke? 'Course it ain't a bloke! ' Chance'd be a fine thing! 'Who is it, then? ' Just someone at work. We've been out a few times. I was meant to have seen her Sunday only I forgot. 'Ls that all right? ' I suppose so. What d'you mean, you suppose so? No, it'll be fine. I'll have to check it out, though. Who with? Listen, if I don't phone back, bring her, all right? I don't wanna upset nobody. 'No, don't worry. ' Are you sure, then? Yeah, yeah, no problem. 'OK, then, sweetheart. 'Lookin' forward to it. ' Say hello to Roxanne for me. 'Yeah. ' Tada, then. 'Bye. ' Listen, I spoke to my little brother today and he says it's all right. D'you wanna come? Ooh, I dunno. I told him you was me mate. I'd still feel a bit awkward. 'Don't be daft. You'll be with ME, won't ya? ' It wouldn't feel right. I thought you wanted to come. Yeah. 'Of course, if you've changed your mind... ' - I was lookin' forward to it. - Oh, I know. - What d'you think, then? - All right, I'll come. You're comin'? 'Yeah. ' Listen, I'll give you a ring later in the week and give you the address. OK, then. 'OK. Tada, then. ' Bye-bye. Jesus! You should've just said yes. Makin' me look like a... Oh! I can hardly say no now. That's up to you. We don't know anything about this person. Some new mate. They've been out a few times. Two hysterical nutters. I'm glad she's got a friend. I'm gonna have a great time(! ) Thought I'd ask Jane as well. Anybody else you want to invite? We've only got four garden chairs! Oh, give us two of them painkillers. There you go. D'you fancy some fish and chips? Don't be sarcastic. I wasn't. Sorry. Cheers, mate. There's a bell here. Don't. I've just done the knocker. All right. Hello there. Hello, sweetheart. You got here in one piece? Long time no see. Yes. Thank you. Hello, birthday girl. All right, Monica? - Look at you. - This is Paul. - Hello, Paul. - How d'you do? Nice to meet you. There's Maurice. Now come away in. - Hi, Jane. - Hello, Monica. This is Jane. Maurice just picked her up from the station. Here he is! Hello, sweetheart. Hiya. All right, Maurice? I got you that. - You didn't have to do that. - It's all right. This is Paul. Maurice. All right, mate. Ain't you got one for me? 'Course I have. Hello, darlin'. Don't kill him. You've landed on your feet here, ain't ya? This is Jane, my lovely assistant. - I talked to you on the phone? - Yeah. - Can I take your coats? - Yes. Drink? Red, white, rose, beer? - I'll have white. - Beer. Thanks a lot. - Cynth? - White, please. - Jane? - Rose. Okey-doke. - Where's the friend? - I've no idea. You got an ashtray, darlin'? There's one on the coffee table. I didn't think you'd have given up. One of the few pleasures in life. - These are very bright. - Don't you like 'em? I'll just put them in a vase. - What's that there for? - We like it. Oi, don't laugh. It's stupid. One of my early works. Miserable little git. You was fuckin' around. Oi, mind your language. - How's work, then? - It's all right, yeah. - Still enjoying it? - Yeah. - When you goin' to college? - Shut up. - You're goin' to college. - I ain't. - You got a good brain. - Don't wanna use it. - Suit yourself. - I will. Paul's a scaffolder. Yeah, your mum said. Bet that's hard work. It can be, mate. - Especially in the winter. - That's right. I wanted to give it a Mediterranean feel. It's a lovely kitchen. - And this is... Oops! - A big lavatory. The downstairs toilet. Handy if you're in the garden. It's really convenient. I think the peach tones make it quite tranquil. Yeah. So you know where it is if you need it. Now... Excuse me, Jane. This is the garage. I thought it was a cupboard! - Is that a new car? - Yes, that's my car. What was wrong with your other one? Nothing. I'll show you upstairs. We'll start with this. Oh. There's the tank. Where I keep towels and bedlinen. Your airing cupboard. Mm. Not very capacious. This is Maurice's bathroom. It's green. Matches your tank. These all new carpets, are they, sweetheart? Oh, yes. And this is the master bedroom. It's more like the bridal suite! It's beautiful! I've always wanted a four-poster. I can see Maurice thrashing about in there(! ) It is a king-size. It's out of a fairy tale. - Bet this cost a bob or two. - It wasn't cheap. And here's another lavatory. That bathroom's mine. The en-suite. You've got one each? Nice, ain't it, Jane? It's like a hotel. Don't want to trip over each other. Oh, you've got everything, Monica. - So where's this friend? - He's here. - No. Your mum's. - What you talkin' about? She asked if she could bring a friend from work. - First I've heard. - Is it? - She never mentioned it? - No. Peculiar. That must be who she's been goin' out with. She's a dark horse, ain't she? - Hello. - No, I'm sorry... I'm a friend of Cynthia's. Yes. Yes, of course. Hello, sweetheart! - Hello. - I thought you were, uh... Come on in. That's me mate, Hortense. Hi. That's me brother's wife. Pleased to meet you. - Monica. - Hello, Monica. Come on out the back, meet me brother. OK. Can I take your coat...? - Hortense. - Hortense. - Hortense. - Thank you. This is me little brother, Maurice. Pleased to meet you, Maurice. Ain't that little. That's Hortense. - Hortense. - Yeah, that's right. And this is me daughter, Roxanne. Oh, happy birthday. Oh, you didn't have to do that, sweetheart. It's OK. - That's Paul, her intended. - He ain't me intended. And this is, um... - Jane. - Maurice's assistant. - Hi. - Very nice to meet you. That's nice, innit? - Drink? Red, white, rose? - White, please. Thanks. That's really nice. You're welcome. - We'll have it later. - No, don't waste it. I've got some to have with the cake. We thought you'd got lost. I took a few wrong turns. - In a minicab? - She's got a car. - Thanks. - There you go. Who wants a top up? - I'll have one. - Not for me. Would you like a crisp, Hortense? No, I'm fine. Thanks. I only met Paul for the first time today, Hortense. - He's a scaffolder. - Are you? Another one bites the dust. That must be quite dangerous. Well, it can be. Come and lollop over here. D'you go up really high? Sometimes. Just you and the elements, really. Ever fallen off? Would you like a crudite? - Thank you, no. - Oh, well. - You work with my mum? - Yeah. - On the machines? - No. Comin' round tomorrow night, Paul? - Mum! - Well... - Eh? - We're goin' out. You'll come and have a drink? It's her 21st. It's no big deal. - I ain't give you your present. - Chicken drumsticks. - D'you want some salad? - Yes, please. I'll get you some. Doing something special tomorrow night? No. Down the pub, as usual. - Can we use fingers? - Use your feet if you want. - You've a knife and fork, Jane. - Bit late now. What d'you do at the factory? - This looks lovely. - Hope it don't kill ya. - You ain't her boss? - No. - Here you are. - Thank you. - Some salad, Paul? - No, thanks. - It's good for you. - He don't want none. What about Jane? Does she want salad? Ta very much. What do you do, Roxanne? I work for the council. - Down the dole? - No, I'm a road sweeper. Who's for a potato? - She's got my plate. - Here you are. - Hortense? - Please. - I'll have some of that. - Please. You DO get girl road sweepers. - Burgers and bangers. - Nice one. That's your one, Roxanne. With your name on it. The burnt one. - Potato for you, Paul? - Please. A nice big one. - Here, darlin'. - One for you, pet? Shall I do YOU, Monica? I'll see to myself. Sit down. What about Maurice? Who's lookin' after the worker? Don't worry about me. I'll eat in a minute. Your potato's there, Cynthia. I think I'LL have salad. Can I have my tongs back? - Got butter? - Yes. Just a minute. And mustard, Monica. You like the American, don't you, Roxanne? Yeah. Ta. I'll just get some salad. - Some butter, Paul? - All right, darlin'? - Please. - Waitin' for the butter. - There, Cynth. - Oh, Maurice! That'll shut you up. Having a steak, are you, Cynthia? Yes. Thank you, Monica. That'll put hairs on your chest. Like some mustard or would you prefer French? This looks lovely, Maurice. Right. There you go, mate. Half a cow for you. - Look at the size of it! - Ridiculous. There's enough there for ALL of us. Put colour in your cheeks. No-one else wants a steak? - Ain't you havin' one? - No, Cynthia. - Not allowed. - Mustard, Paul? - It's lovely. - Can't get rid of it, can you? Oh, it's a real communal thing, eating. Yes. This is a lovely house. Well, WE like it. I'll show you round later, if you want. Thanks. That'd be nice. Yeah, it's brilliant. You live in a flat, Hortense? Yeah. It's her own. She's got a mortgage. - Whereabouts are you? - Kilburn. That's a bit of a schlepp. Old Kent Road and back every day. - She drives! - I get on the tube. I drive to the station. You've got a bedsit, ain't you, Paul? - Yeah. - That's a shame. Wish I had a place of me own. D'you still live at home, then? No chance! You two work on the same machine? No. I'm the only one on slits. D'you choose your own working hours, Roxanne? Not bloody likely. - She's going to college. - I ain't goin'. Hortense went to college. Mm. What did you study? - Optometry. - What's that, then? - It's to do with the eye. - That's right. Testing. - Given it all up now, have you? - Not exactly. Why are you working in a cardboard box factory, then? - I'm doing research. - That's interestin'. What sort of research? - Medical. - What, you lookin' at her head? Take no notice. There's nothing wrong with HER head. - Did you go to university? - Yeah. - Did you do a degree? - Yes. - She just looks at our eyes. - Yes. What for? You can tell a lot about people - from lookin' at their eyes. - True. - Can you? - Windows to your soul. A nice way of puttin' it, Jane. - Who wants a top up? - No, thanks, I'm driving. Yes, please. - Here you are. - Oi, greedy guts! Take a leaf out of her book, Paul. - Lost his licence. - All right, Mum. - Did you have an accident? - Just had one too many. The demon drink, eh? Is that who you've been goin' out with? Yes. She thought I'd been seein' a bloke. Could've been, I suppose. - I still turn heads. - Turn stomachs! Oh, Jane! I was just playin' with it. D'you want one, Hortense? We might as well pop the lot. - No! No! - It's like a bonfire. # Happy birthday to you # Happy birthday to you # Happy birthday, dear Stinker Yeah, Maurice, very funny Darlin', join in. # Happy birthday to you # Hip-hip, hooray! Nice one - champagne. - Did anybody bring my camera in? - It's there. - D'you have to, Monica? - Of course. Watch where you point that, Maurice. And... Come on, blow your candles out, Roxanne. Everybody else gather round. - Come on, darlin'. - Cynth, you tuck in there. Hortense, in there. Hurry. It's burnin' me eyebrows off. Make a wish. One big blow. - And... - Cheese! Hey! I hope your wish comes true, pet. - Roxy. - Ta. Cynth. Here you are, sweetheart. Oh, that's nice. Mm. And Paul. - Cynth again. - Thank you, Maurice. - Cor, this is livin', ain't it? - Yeah. OK. One for me. Right. On you go, then. Oh, yeah. OK. Er... I would like to propose a toast for Roxanne on her 21st birthday. Now it's all legal and twice as boring for it. Mind you, it's been legal since you were 18 anyway. Happy birthday, sweetheart. - Ta. - Roxanne. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. - There you go. - What's that? - Book token. - Don't be stupid! Fuckin' hell, Maurice. Thanks! - Your 21st, innit? - Thanks, Monica. Happy birthday, pet. Don't spend it all in the one shop. Here, happy birthday. Wish I'd brought MY present with me. Give it to her tomorrow. That's her birthday. Don't expect I shall see her tomorrow. Gonna sit down, darlin'? Sit down, everybody. Have some cake. Hortense. Jane. Where am I goin'? Anywhere you like. - Come on the end, Paul. - Hortense. Where's the bathroom? It's just through there, sweetheart. The door straight ahead, the light's on the left. Thank you. - She's a nice girl. - Yes, she is, Maurice. - Seems very pleasant. - Yeah, she's all right. - How you doin', Paul? - All right. - Has your shirt dried off? - Yeah. She takes after her mother. Does she? You know her as well? Work at the factory, does she? You're lookin' at her. Eh? She's my daughter. What's the matter with ya? Maurice... it's me daughter. Don't be stupid. She's had too much to drink. She can't be the one that... What? Hortense, sweetheart. She's your sister! What? That's her half-sister, Paul. You... you eat your cake, sweetheart. Thanks. - What's the matter? - I'm all right. I told 'em. Tell 'em who you are, sweetheart. It wasn't supposed to happen like this. Well, it has. So you tell 'em, go on. Is it true? Yes, it is. You never told her, then? I'm sorry, darlin'. Will someone tell me what the fuck's goin' on? She's your sister! Maurice? Monica? I always said she had a right to know. No, Roxanne. Sweetheart, darlin'! - Darlin', please! - I'll smack you, you slag! Ain't enough you had one bastard, - you had to have two! - Stop it! Roxanne? Roxy? Sit down, darlin'. Sit down, Paul. Cynthia, I think I should go. I don't want you to go. You sit down. Eat your cake, Jane. You don't half choose your moments, Cynthia. When's the RIGHT moment, Maurice? You tell me that. Paul, get my coat. We're goin'. - Don't go. - Why didn't you tell me? - I thought you knew. - You used to tell me everythin'! - I'm sorry. - You've fuckin' let me down! As for you, you've ruined my party and I hope you're happy! Roxy... Roxanne! She don't mean it, darlin'. She's just a little bit upset. - Where you goin'? - I don't know. It's all been a bit of a shock, innit? Did you know about her? I always thought she'd had a boy. - She's a slag. - No, she's not. - She fuckin' is! - She loves you. We all love you. You comin' back? - No. Why should I? - You got to. - You gotta face up to it. - Face up to what? She's left her card. Oh, well. I'll post it on to her. I'll take it. You'll be lucky if you ever see her again. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Would I? You've been workin' at it for 18 years, ain't ya? You turned my father against me, you turned my Maurice against me and you turned me daughter against me. You'll be havin' a go at HER next. Sorry about this, Hortense. Finished, Jane? Why don't you sit down? - You got a short memory. - What is it now? You'd have none of this if I hadn't given Maurice the money to start with. That was your father's insurance money. - It was for me and Roxanne. - And Maurice. He didn't want none till he talked to you. He was entitled to it! I went out cleaning', took her to school, - then did a full day's work. - Didn't we know it! You've done nothing but spend his money since you met him. What else do you do with money? At least we made something of ourselves. Haven't you just. You wanna try bringing' up a kid on your own! She can't help it. She's never had enough love. And you've never got on. - That ain't my fault. - I know. But she needs you. - Come on. - I don't want to. What do YOU think, Paul? I think he's right, darlin'. - Do ya? - Yeah. Well, I ain't sayin' nothin'. You won't have to. You just have to listen. Come on. I'm sorry, Roxanne. It just came out, darlin'. I didn't mean to spoil your party. - Tell her, Maurice. - Leave her, Cynth. Just tell her the truth. Darlin'... I got pregnant when I was 15... and your grandad sent me away to this place. Didn't he, Maurice? I didn't know she was gonna come lookin' for me. But I gotta tell you the truth, darlin', I'm glad she did. It ain't her fault, sweetheart. She didn't wanna hurt you, no more than I did. You tell her, sweetheart. It's true. She didn't wanna upset you. I'm sorry. All right? She said you weren't never gonna come back. Who did? I never said any such thing. She's twisted everything as usual. Yes, you did. Well, you was wrong, 'cause she has come back, ain't you, sweetheart? I always thought you should've known. You should've told her. 'Course I should've. But I didn't think there'd be no need. You seem to have told all and sundry. Meaning me, I suppose. I am his wife, after all. Then behave like his wife. - Why ain't you give him no kids? - Quiet, Cynthia. That's between Maurice and me. You might not have wanted 'em but HE did. - Shut up! - You know nothing. - Don't I? - There are things... - Maurice. - Like what? Tell her. Tell me what? Why can't you tell her? She can't have kids. Simple as that. She's physically incapable... of havin' children. We've had every test known to medical science. She's been prodded, poked, had operations. We've had 15 years of it and she can't have a baby. I love you to bits... but it's almost destroyed our relationship. You know it has. There. I've said it. So where's the bolt of lightning'? Secrets and lies! We're ALL in pain. Why can't we SHARE our pain? I've spent my entire life tryin' to make people happy! And the three people I love the most in the world hate each other's guts! I'm in the middle - I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE! I'm sorry, Hortense. But you are a very brave person. - A very stupid person. - No, you're not. You wanted to find the truth and you were prepared to suffer the consequences. And I admire you for that. I mean it. You're so lucky, Cynthia. Have you really been working in the factory? No. What d'you do, then? I'm an optometrist. Welcome to the family. Maurice... I wish I'd had a dad like you. You're lovely! His name's... Bingham. Your father. He's from America. I met him on holiday. Benidorm. He's a medical student. One morning, I come down and he weren't there no more. But he was a nice man. He was. Was MY father a "nice man"? Oh, don't break my heart, darlin'! I'm all right. Oh, PLEASE, Roxanne, sweetheart! PLEASE! I'm frightened. Why? You don't love me any more. Not like you used to. Maurice! You don't know how MUCH I love you. Do you? We've got each other, haven't we? Bet you've never seen so much shit, have you? You wanna see my mum's house! D'you miss her? Yeah. - Did you get on with her? - She used to drive me mad! That's what they're there for, ain't it? Yeah. That's me old chair, there. Aw. I always wanted a little sister. It's just my brothers were much older than me so I ended up playing on my own. Oh, I know what you mean. What you laughin' at? Do you feel like we're sisters? I dunno. Do you? - It's a bit weird. - Yeah. I don't mind it, though. No. Nor do I. Don't even know you yet, do I? D'you wanna go out one night? Yeah. Yeah. You can take me to one of your pubs. Yeah, all right. How would you introduce me? As your half-sister? Yeah. No, man. Too much explaining to do. - It's what I'd say, though. - Would ya? Yeah. Yeah. Best to tell the truth, innit? Yeah, it is. That way, nobody gets hurt. Here you are, sweetheart. Tea's up! Go on, darlin'. - Want a biscuit? - No, I'm all right. Sit yourself down. - You all right with that? - Yeah. That's it. Who'd have thought it, eh? Look at you two sitting' there - like a couple of garden gnomes! Oh, this is the life, eh? Yeah.

That's it. OK? Yeah. That's really great, yeah. OK, as I said before, you're under no obligation but you can, if you want to, give me a tiny, little twinkle. That is lovely. Great. A little bit closer. Don't you worry, it'll be all right. There's just a little bit... That's it. And you've got an eyelash on your nose. We don't want that, do we? Supposed to be on your eye, not your snitch. You've got a lovely smile when you smile, haven't you? You keep that lovely, gorgeous smile. That's lovely. That'll do for the time being. Well done, Sarah. That's the easy bit. [Children sing loudly] They make a noise, don't they? At least they can play out around here. I suppose so. What is it? Is that a suit? Well, it came as a combination. Do they go together? Well, if you think they do, they do. It's nice. 21 in August. She is. Used to worry myself sick when she played out. She survived it, though, didn't she? All things considering. She's back on the streets now. - I beg your pardon? - Well, she is, in't she? - I don't half miss her. - I know. How long is it since we've seen her? Two and a half years. - We could always ask her over. - I'D like to. For her birthday? It's only a couple of months away. What now? "Roxanne, what're you doing for your 21st?" "I'm going to my auntie and uncle's house "for my birthday treat. " It was only a suggestion. She's probably doing her own thing. I suppose we'd have to invite Cynthia as well. There's no show without Punch. - She'd like to see the place. - I'm sure she would. - She can't help it. - Can't she? It's about time you showed it off. I mean, you've done a lovely job. I think so. I must get down to see her. - You speak to her on the phone. - Not the same thing, is it? She's YOUR sister. I'm really proud of that portrait. I reckon that's the last time she ever smiled. I dunno what's got into you lately. You complaining? No. Well, shut up, then. Sit on me own for years, can't get you to stop in. - Now you never go out. - Leave it out. You sit there with a face like a slapped arse! Well, what's there to smile about? Thought HE might've phoned at the weekend. - Who? - Who d'you think? - Ain't heard from him for ages. - He's busy. We're all busy. He's got his weddings. It's the summer. Out of sight, out of mind. Well, ring him yourself. He's YOUR brother. I'm not runnin' up me phone bill! He knows where I am if he wants me. He'd have had us up there to see it by now, I expect, if it wasn't for her. Toffee-nosed cow. What's HE want with six bedrooms, anyway? What's all your mates doin' tonight, then? I ain't asked 'em. You wanna get yourself a bloke. That's what you wanna do. I don't wanna get anything. I'm quite happy here. At your age, I could've had the pick of the crop. - Why didn't you? - I lost my poor mother. - Oh, here we go. - I was stuck at home, looking after Maurice and your grandad. - Yeah, we know. - Then I got saddled with you. - That was MY downfall, darlin'. - I didn't ask to be born. And I never asked to have you. You should've thought about that before you dropped your knickers! - With... or without? - I think without. Without? OK. What about this one? Better with... or without? - I think this time it's with. - With? All right. We'll pop this one in, then. - I hear you're a good runner. - Yeah. Cross country. Have you won anything? Not yet. I've only just started. OK, then. Look up again. This is gonna blur a bit but just tell me what you CAN read, OK? H... L... A... - C... T. - Right. - I can't read any more. - OK, that's good. Very good. I'm gonna do your other eye now. - You off, then? - Yeah. Plans for the weekend? Gotta sort through my mum's things. - Have you? - Yeah. - Hope it goes OK. - It's gotta be done. - OK, then. - See you on Monday. - Have a nice weekend. - Cheers. Ooh, enjoy the christening. I'll try. - Bye. - Bye. [People arguing] [Man] We've got a family... [Woman] It's ten past. We've got to pick Shelattica up. [Man] What are you talking about? [Woman] We've got ten minutes. [Man] We've got to sort this out while we're here. Basically, right, it's you here - in this massive house. - Thank you. We have got two children. You understand? - And we could have more. - What? We wanna have more. You can't stay here on your own. It's not fair. We can sell the house and split the money. You could split this house in two and it'd still be bigger than our place. [Man] You can't split it in two. I'll just sort your tie out. - Looks just a bit... ...skew-whiff again. - Can we have the paper out? - Yeah. Quick as you like. Smashing. Put your hands together. Really nice. OK. Put your paper down there. Right, here we go. OK, and... Do we say cheese, Maurice? You can say whatever you like. Just give me a little... That's it. A-A-A-A-AH! Oh, yeah. Very sweet. OK, that's lovely. - It took you 15 years? - Yes. - They give you a prize? - No. Not even a stethoscope? The baby! [Maurice] That's really lovely. I'm glad he's got his eyes open. That's it. Look down. Lovely! Are you gonna see that flea collar? Don't worry about that. Hang on. You just come out the way. Here we go... I think I had the comb in. Lovely. Very good. Does he look good? - He DOES. So do you. - Yes. Thank you very much, Jane. It's for my auntie. - Fond of you, is she? - No, she's in India. Time I got married, innit? Oh, I see. Pick a bride time, is it? I don't want flash... Ah... lovely! I never thought I'd have any. Fertility treatment. Oh! It's a miracle. Don't do that with your nose. Stop it. [Maurice] Look at that lovely cat over there. Oh, let him scratch it first. Go on, that's it. That's it. Lovely! I feel so silly. Lovely. And that's it. Thank you very much. - What d'you think you're doing? - Sorry. - Didn't you hear me? - I didn't, actually. - Hiya. - What? - Hiya. - Mind, out the way. - Wanna drink? - What? If I want a drink, I'll get it myself, thank you. Since when was hoovering a spectator sport? Can I have a glass too, please? - I thought... - I'm having milk. - Here you go. - Give me a highball. You don't put milk in a wine glass. - Thank you. - That'll do you good. - Meaning? - Nothing. Had a good day? Scintillating(! ) I suppose you'll be starving as usual. A little bit peckish, yeah. - D'you want ME to do something? - Like what? - Anything you like. - No, I bloody well wouldn't! Oh, all right, then. There's the fridge. There's the freezer. There's the hob. There's the recipe books. Help yourself. And don't make a mess. Unless you fancy a takeaway. - You're not gonna smile? - No. OK. It's a free world. You're under no obligation but you can, if you want to, give me a lovely big smile! Oh, go on. Come on. Lovely! You're under no obligation but you can smile if you like. - Did you smile, Mother? - No. To me, that's it. Now look at each other. That's it. It'll be all right. Look up. - Wait a minute. - You're closing your eyes. Don't forget to burp it properly. Give it a drop of gripe water. We used to pour it down Roxanne by the gallon. She farted like a trooper! It runs in the family. Would madam care to test the temperature? I'm sure it'll be fine. Thanks. Been bad, has it? It eased off at lunchtime. I managed a couple of crackers. It's unpredictable, isn't it? No, it's not unpredictable. You've drawn the short straw, mate. You're tellin' me. I wish it WAS unpredictable. What are you gonna have for your tea? - You know what I really fancy? - What? A steak. You're not havin' any steak in THIS house. Don't worry about me. You'll keel over with a heart attack. Do meself something later. There's Chicken Kiev in the freezer. Be a bit cold, wouldn't it? Anyway... I'm on a diet. You're disgusting. OK, that's very good. We can see the ring perfectly. Sir, if you just bring your chin up... Sorry. Listen, take your glasses off. I don't want to take my glasses off. Go on, take them off. - Doesn't matter. - It's all right. - He looks better with them off. - It's what I look like. Take the cross out, please. It's a gift. Take it
