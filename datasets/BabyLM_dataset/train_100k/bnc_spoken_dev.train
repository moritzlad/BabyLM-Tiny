very rarely not a lot cos you know in the department I've got it's ah we're in touch with all of the suppliers and all the sub- contractors right erm, and with agencies like Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise so a lot of the stuff we get in is written and we have to reply okay a lot of it's verbal right but but it's erm an amount of written work that needs to be done with ours it's a lot more telephone communication okay telephone so I'd say mainly verbal just confirmation of orders okay,again I mean these are things that talk about confirmation I mean quite honestly I'm I'd be quite happy if we had offices where people talk to each other ninety per cent of the time rather than send memos and faxes to each other, and on the whole we are really talking about inside the office with the people who we work with I mean obviously clients as well trying to find something different, we tend tend to find that it's very very easy sometimes to make a phone call it's much easier to make a phone call and to talk to that person and give them the personal touch. Really the only reason I could think of when it's you know it is important to put things on paper are really like the last three bits that we talked the last three things we talked about which detailed information would need to be there so people can read it when you know it's got to get to a lot people not all in the same place at the same time or when it's you need a copy. They're the only times really and as with the I B M the I B M people's the company I B M said if it's more than a page is it really worth sending it out . Okay. Gonna ask you to do an exercise now er it'll it'll take us to four o'clock before we start talking about assertiveness what I'm gonna ask you to do is in one, two three, one two in two twos and a three I want you to put on paper one side one sheet of paper to sum up all the things we've done about communication so far today and it's going to other people on this course, and it's going to be marked by one of them on this course. On the criteria we've been talking about today, so find yourself a partner that you haven't worked with today somebody erm if you go in the same group that Kathy's in because then if it comes up to four o'clock Kathy wants to go then you can be the other partner you've got half an hour to put on one sheet of paper clearly and concisely what we've done on communications. Okay, erm well if you go you go with erm Neil and Kathy then they can give you something different, alright. You've got I'll give you twenty minutes and it's gotta be ready to be handed over to the other group in twenty minutes time. Has just one of us gotta write it or Well we don't want no all we want is one so that at the end we want from each group to go to another group to be marked. that's stumped you hasn't it? that's one way of putting it Can we have some erm date Okay let me just I'm sorry ah yes Have we just gotta list it have we? er Have we just gotta list? What've I just been talking about, what did she say? You've gotta to do it so it's clear, concise and puts across the information that you feel is important to get across right Sorry you want some paper does anybody else want some paper And you can speak loud because then it'll get recorded okay and then we can actually expressing yourselves, express yourself erm oh yeah, oh yeah yeah Paper Gordon? He's going for it that's right erm Oh yeah yeah but you know yeah the set of circumstances described yeah said it was the minute or so Can we elaborate on that erm, the time the time I've given you you seem to be quite busy another five minutes or less? Five minutes, five minutes, that enough? Okay five minutes. Well it was there so I thought I'd bring it I know you can't have it huh on to the ring road there first roundabout I come to yeah, well that's no problem and then from there even I can't get lost famous last words yeah reactions that'll be an area should have been here this morning I was coming so but um Yes I am but I don't being as far away as I am yeah I mean I yeah West Ham Oh dear Okay, everybody seems as though they've finished right can you put your as I say team one team two team three please , one, two, three Okay that's group three you see just to prove I'm listening that's for group one one okay, okay I'm not telling you who's doing whose right please mark it, marks out of ten and I want you to be able to justify your marks. Marks out of ten Okay, just about it now Okay, gonna ask each group what marks they've given and why, now it's not for the other team to justify it because it's all a subjective thing but the thing is we're hopefully marking them against the same criteria as everybody else because we've all been in the same place and listened to the same things and read the same things, however, now we know obviously it doesn't necessarily mean that everybody's taken in the same things. So let's just see how people have marked and what people see as the criteria. Let's start with your group Mark cos yeah right well we have given team two six six, fine As we feel that they missed a fair bit out what they've written is very good but erm they've missed quite a bit out So is it not detailed enough for you or or? It is detailed alright but as I said what they've written is detailed enough but they've missed out erm various things that we needed to know such as? Such as er what we were trying to listen sorry what we were trying to talk erm with the person listening didn't listen er what we were trying to talk about right, okay that warranted more marks for that one but for missing that out but kept on repeating themselves okay, so is repeated, something being repeated and also something being missed out okay. Any comments on that? Group two Not really no Do you think it's fair comment? yeah erm, I think we felt slightly pressurised in the timescale Okay erm but er trying to get down as many points as we could, in a way that you can express yourself but to show that you were What was your priorities when you were doing that, what were your priorities as far as, was it to get it all down or was it just to get in down in a particular way what what do you see as the priorities when you were talking about doing it? Well to try and show that we'd covered we'd taken in as much of what was going on Okay erm and trying to show that we'd understood it Right,alright we say we do ah group three well they got two it depends on what their criteria is if it's erm just listening a diary of events of what's gone on right then they got ten, if it's showing an understanding of what was in that diary then we're give them four Good, why only four? erm, there's on certain parts of ah what they put has shown they they've understood what was in that part of the diary like in the exercises relating this morning to or to learning like with the Roman numerals and the other thing they shown that they understood what was in that context, but then on erm when you get later on it's just er they've started off with it erm the report described what they've learnt but they haven't actually put what they've learnt right, okay yeah it's what they've done to learn it right, okay You know on certain passages it's like we've completed a questionnaire and then discussed it right they're not sure what they the discussion was really about okay whereas other parts they have gone into more detail which is ones they've gone into more details with So what they've done is they've picked a way of doing but they kept chopping and changing the way they've been doing that all the time. Any comments group three? Yeah, at the beginning was when sort of got twenty minutes left to do it erm we were fine there and I think it was the beginning part was and then we started panicking then like sort of after that you said oh do you want five minutes or more and we all sort of looked at each other you know and we didn't feel that we had enough time erm so we just sort of really okay and yeah we did forget the first paragraph of the of what we had learned so we just covered what we'd done really Could this be time pressure then? We also er actually what was meant to be on the course yeah we weren't quite sure if that was what you wanted Yeah Yeah you know Before you mark it I did mark it Don't know what you were asking us to do we were a bit unsure of In what way? Well, we really know whether you wanted us to put what we learned from the report what we'd actually done that day as in just listing it as you said like a diary or Why didn't you ask? We were a bit Why didn't you ask? That's why we were chopping and changing because some of you'd say one thing somebody that couple of times Well you could have asked you know. Questions like that you can ask then. You know here we come down to very basic premise of communication yeah remember what we said the first thing to date you have to understand what you're trying to do it's the same with written communication as well, being clear and if you're not clear then make it clear. Now really it's the same thing, don't be afraid you can't be afraid to ask because if you're not clear in your own mind how the hell is the person who's trying to communicate with you going to be clear. So that's why Well well done at least it was a a time question of course time pressure is supposed to be there it's not supposed to be nice and comfortable A because we haven't got that much time and B because the little bit more pressure you're under the more likely likely to leave certain things out so maybe you've got the point. But you know you agree with the comments that came in there yeah righto well done, well done both groups okay and then I need your your comments on this group over Yeah we gave them Group two seven. Seven yeah Good, okay erm, they've covered all the areas discussed but they didn't sort of pinpoint the areas of the Ah like again something like this what we actually okay that's what we're really sure about that's why. erm like you we read the first passage and it was kind of what's what's all this about if you wasn't in the room and you didn't know what was being you haven't got a clue what was going on because it doesn't tell you, but the rest of the sections that put down they do give a sort of brief analysis so worth seven you reckon Well we was being a bit generous like if you take them down to six What were you trying to do? What were trying to me what were you trying to do? Cover everything in the Cover everything, that was your main priority was it? yep Okay, and they did that do you think? They covered everything they to do that but they just if I'd have just read that without knowing what had happened you know I Well the middle group said said that your one was yeah How does it compare to your one then, how do you feel it compares to your one? Well we went, we went into a bit more detail Bit more detail, yeah more at the beginning Measured by the middle group's criteria they would've had three then would they? Eh? We're not that cruel No, no no no we're just looking at what criteria we're measuring yeah And you know this brings another important aspect up which is very important about communications, erm you know we've jollied along talking about what communication is making sure people know you know what you want etcetera etcetera etcetera but also don't forget that different people can have different perceptions of the same same things but as I say here we are we sat here we done we've done about an hour an hour and a half on written communications and yet you know when we passed the papers around it hasn't been too bad but there has been different things that people have gone for both in the writing of these reports and both in the marking of them as well. So you know what this is a measure of it's not a measure of anything it doesn't mean that one group's done better than the others it just means that's the way it's been measured the work that they've done has been measured by another group which isn't good or bad it's just hopefully picking out the important criteria and applying them to the work that we've done and the notes we've produced and the way we've marked other people's. Now having said that different people might make take put the emphasis on different things. Bear that in mind and also an important part of communications that's why there's always so many problems about which is right. Everybody sees a different picture and of course most people see don't see it anyway because by the time they look and see what's happened it's already happened . Right well done yeah fine no problems Have I No leave it in you don't want any homework tonight Right exhausted now anyway Sorry if they don't turn up till eleven o'clock tomorrow yeah yeah Okay, alright, I want to move on now quarter past four now, I want to talk about assertiveness. Assertiveness always seems to be one of these subjects that really, I don't why but it seems to get to get people talking about about being aggressive about dismissive about lots of different things and I think assertion perhaps is one thing that we need we need to clarify before we do anything else. Let me ask you a question. I'll give you a minute each, write down what you think being assertive means. What does assertive being assertive mean? How'ya done ya finished? All done? What do we mean what is assertive mean to you?this is gonna be quite interesting I suspect. Anybody want to start the ball rolling erm, it's how confident you are in yourself and the way that you actually put your point across. on the same lines as getting your point across and not being afraid to do it your point across and not being afraid of doing it Okay, being afraid what sort of things scared ah what people might think or saying Good good I've got trousers on right getting your point across effectively yeah getting your point across effectively yeah apart from being positive in putting your point across and erm being clear in things that you say things that you do being strong about it clear and strong, when you say strong what do you mean? Or is it you know how can you be strong Making yourself understood clearly basically, knowing what you're talking about Knowing what you knowing what you're talking about being clear okay yep More or less on the same lines having a point of view and putting it across without wavering, don't erm Cover your point Yes,getting your poi yeah okay yeah, okay Having a point of view and putting it across to other people I think we've and words are put clear and strong and I think I'd use the word forceful forceful, okay but the other bit you're happy with Oh yeah great what ya say great are you scared? erm, the one thing that I thought was under person who is who is talking he's gotta be I think he's gotta be firm so that the person understands that erm that what is required but he's also gotta be fair at the same time hasn't he? than fair okay, good good What's a person like when they're being assertive? Anybody else? Right think of a time when you were assertive When was a time when you were assertive, just think you can be anything assertive over anything it doesn't matter think of a time when you feel you were being assertive anybody think of a time when they were being assertive hoovering, cleaning the windows a bit like all men Oh now here we go right, you be careful you're letting yourself in here is gone She's that's being assertive I can be a man okay just think of a time when you were assertive and you all everybody think of a time when you were assertive, can you think of a time, anybody can't think of a time when they were assertive? You not gonna tell me even if they can, now you know you're being non-assertive. Think of a time when you've been assertive it can assertive in the very very slightest form it doesn't matter, assertive of some sort. Got a time yeah yes great I know I have been but I can't think of one at the moment make it up, make one up what would it be like if you were being assertive ? Alright we've got that time you were being assertive, think of a time when you weren't assertive. Think of a time when you weren't assertive, just think of a time when you weren't assertive can you think of one yeah If you can't think of one make it up What's the difference, what's the difference well erm I wasn't being assertive I was a bit walked over you let yourself get walked over, okay. What made it what it feel as though you'd been walked over? well erm, it's just a sense of ya know I couldn't care less it's yeah go on an do that I don't give a stuff Did it bother you? Not at the time no it didn't it bothered me when it was done because I thought you've probably done something and the outcome would be that so at the time it didn't bother me because I wasn't interested in the situation So is that being as you weren't being assertive at the time yeah Not bothered yeah, I think what it does I mean because I had the change to alter the situation okay uh uh I wouldn't take the chance So what's the difference between the two situations in you? In me? I dunno I felt like I let myself down You feel like you let yourself down, okay I'd agree with that You feel like you let yourself down, what how would you say you let yourself down, I don't mean to be specific but in what way did you let yourself down erm, I I let the person do what they wanted to do and not what I wanted to do I just went along with what they said okay, okay you feel you let yourself down because of that yeah it could've be done better okay, right at the the time I think when I wasn't being assertive and when I wasn't the difference was the person was younger than me and I was being assertive and then when I perhaps wasn't and like said you feel after that you've let yourself down. The person was older than me and he's a bit higher up the rank than me and it's all about it probably comes with experience he's to stand for yourself really but it's when you're our age and a bit younger you don't want to be seen to be rocking the boat if there's something that's going on that you don't agree with but you're asked to do something that you don't want to do valid reasons you haven't got the time or it's not really up to you to do it right those are the two you'd have liked to have turned round and say look I don't wanna do it yeah it's difficult when you're a customer yeah, yeah that's right alright erm with me I don't feel comfortable being assertive What's the difference then like what's the difference what stops you being what stops you It's not knowing who I can be assertive with done it I don't think it comes naturally either I mean you have to work at it don't you? okay ya know some people can not coming naturally not being there you just sort of No I find the other way I I find that I am assertive whereas at times I shouldn't be in fact most of the time I shouldn't be and I am and I'm the opposite okay you find it hard you find it hard to do to make a special effort what is it you have to make a special effort to do? to get aggressive to get aggressive yeah erm because it's not in my nature to be aggressive alright erm I find that when I'm not being as assertive er I'm not very good in a one to one situation thinking your answers back straight away. I can go away from a conversation and half an hour later I think I should have said that right erm where I am assertive it's where I'm working to a rule book I know those rules backwards and I want somebody to follow those to the letter right then I can say that goes in that holder you do that that that and I don't want any variation just do it so you're very clear about what it is that you want yeah when you're clear about what it is that you want you can be assertive yeah, I can be assertive when you're not too clear about it you find it difficult being assertive that's it yeah okay, what's the difference between being assertive and not being assertive what's the big difference between the two? A matter of confidence A matter of confidence okay No I was just about to say confidence really I find it quite difficult to get assertive erm but when the situation does arise I suddenly get a gut feeling about it later okay whereas you look back at the end of the day and if you haven't done what you did you sort of feel like a bit down ah and you wish you had Being true to yourself yeah go on I mean is this being true to yourself and letting yourself down and you know not saying what you feel you should've said erm perhaps now I wanna talk about one area in particular and that is this thing about you know submissiveness it seems that most people look at things that disturb you either as submissive or aggressive. A lot of people tend to look at assertion as being aggressive there's a total difference. Being aggressive is just as bad as being submissive it really is because people swing to one side you know it some people are very good at being aggressive and are very good at diving in and getting their own way and just ju by being aggressive it's naturally aggressive. Now the only problem with that is I sometimes look that these people I wonder are they really happy being aggressive all the time does that really make them feel happy? I don't think so, really it's just the opposite problem of what we've got over here, being submissive now we all know what being being sub submissive yes we let people walk all over us we don't say yeah we we listen to what everybody else says and therefore the opposite is you're gonna get aggressive to get what we want. They're both two sides of the same coin y'know, being aggressive isn't what it's all about, being aggressive certainly isn't what it's all about. What's the point of being aggressive with somebody when they're gonna walk away feeling as if they've just been walked all over, so you've still got the same situation you've got one person walking away feeling a little bit fed up and the other person not so if you talk about assertiveness in terms of aggression and in terms of submission i.e. there's going to be a winner and there's going to be a loser depending which way round you look at it then you still haven't quite grasped what we mean by assertiveness. You don't have to be aggressive to be assertive, look at some of these comments we've got here how confident you are in yourself and how you put your point across. How you put your point across getting your point across and not being afraid of doing it, doing it effectively putting the point across, being positive in putting your point across so it's all about putting your point across effectively, clearly congruously i.e. my body says what I mean. I don't have to shout I don't have to be aggressive or intimidate people I just have to tell people what I feel, think etc. Does being assertive mean getting your own way? Not necessarily It never does, it should never it should never be tied in with getting your own way. Aggressive, aggression might be tied it with getting your own but being assertive is not about getting your own way. Being aggressive is about exactly what you put up here this is me this is how I feel about what we're talking about. This is what I think, not just hiding away and saying get on with it you know get on with whatever you want to do, no this is what I believe is what I believe that we're doing. It doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna get it but it means that you're being true to yourself because you're putting your point across. And it's how you put that point across, if you put it across and if the body language you use when you put it across and do you know what makes the biggest different the biggest difference about how you put it across the most important factor about how you put it across and what you're trying to do? Any idea? We talked about it being clear, being clear about what it is that you want. Any situation with any person you need to be clear in your mind what you want before if there's any dithering if there's any way I'm not sure that will stop ya it's being sure being convinced of what you want is you know exactly what you want you know which direction you're going in. If you don't there's plenty of people out there that do and they'll walk right all over you to get what they want. So it's not about being aggressive it's not about being aggressive or submissive it's about being clear to true to yourself being aware of what you want from any given situation. Just because you're assertive that doesn't mean you're gonna get everything that you want because you're not being assertive just means that other people are aware of what you want. Being submissive is the co point where what happens when you're submissive you keep it inside you don't feel you're worthy enough or you haven't got you haven't got the self esteem to rate yourself as being able to have what it is that you want, so you keep it inside and you don't say anything and then you walk away should've said this and should've said that and all it does is eat away at you and it does that to you physically as well I mean scientific tests are already showing now that physically these sort of things you do if often be submissive enough what that does it pretty much helps helps you to eat your body up from the inside and causes physical problems which pretty much do that anyway. Because you keep it all inside it against you, you begin to feel bad about yourself you begin to lose your self esteem erm you know and that's the most dangerous thing about being bullied in terms of being at school or whether it's even at work and being submissive is withdraw internalise and to take it out on yourself. All this is you're going to take out on somebody else you take it out on yourself. the total is different opposite on the scale, instead of all this stuff inside of you, you just let it build up and you let it build up until whoosh and you throw it outside at other people, and that itself that that as well causes physical problems. Apparently, I mean I've read this, but I don't know how there was actual references to it as well but apparently what they used to do run a test they used to do was they used to get people very very angry take some blood from them, put put them inside of rats and it would kill the rats. When you get angry you pump all sorts of different chemicals around your body and they don't do your body any good that's for sure, you know you get the adrenalin that starts making everything well making the blood move faster heart beat faster you get other chemicals ready and if those chemicals aren't used properly or if something doesn't happen and it uses those particular chemicals and they're left inside the body then that causes eventually physical illness in some sort of physical wearing of some sort or another, so gradually just the opposite of this where you're you're not internalising your throwing it out, but there's a hell of a lot in there that's been stored up there and bottled up there before it throws out, and when you do tend to be aggressive it's not because you're being aggressive on purpose it's because it's just something that just happens and wells up when you get to a particular point and whoosh out it comes. So you know there's the, don't link aggression with assertion, two difference. Assertion you're clear about what you want, you can't there's no need to get get up about it there's no need to worry about it this is what you want and this is the way it is, you don't have to shout, you just have to stick to your point. exercise that you do in terms of assertion in terms of helping build people's assertion is what we call a broken record exercise, okay where one person wants something and the other person is trying to change their minds, okay, you get it in conversation when people don't take you seriously and you've asked for something and they don't take you serious they try and avoid the point, they try and change the subject. Assertion comes into being when you still bring the conversation back this is what I want nothing else will do, and bringing it right the way back all the time to discuss what it is why it's called a broken record exercise, we'll give it a quick go now. What I want you to do is in your couples I want one of you to pretend that one of you's got a grievance okay, think about it before you do it. One of you's got grievance and you want something done, there is something that you want done and the other person, is the person you want to do it or the person who's got a part to play. Now this other person is trying to trying to change the conversation, trying to take you away from what you're trying what you want done. What I want you to do as as the person who's being assertive is to stick to the point. Stick to the point, even if it means you're acting like a bit of a broken record, get that person make sure they hear what you're saying even if you have to repeat it over and over again. What I want you to practice doing is to try and get yourself saying over and over again regardless of how the other person tries to ask you questions to get you out of it, and then swap over. Okay what I ask you to do as with being assertive, first of all be clear about what it is that you're going to try and do, be clear about what it is and what the situation is, explain it to the partner and then try it and let's see how it doing. Okay, working with anybody, just just for just for a few minutes each it's just because what I want you to experience is what it's like to continually go over the same thing, I want you to experience that, to continually stick to your guns just experience that okay? Alright off you go. Okay, let's swap over, what I want you to remember is it's not a conversation it's not the try not to get into a conversation what we're trying to do is we're trying to stick to one person's trying to stick to their point the other person's trying to take them off it, okay? I want you to try and do that for as long as you can, the person's who's trying to take them off it you try and take them off that point as long as you can, the other person stick to your guns, okay? Swap it round then off you go again. Okay, How did it go? erm difference Different Yeah, because I mean it's not a real life situation So I mean you can't talk, the problem with me is I I will always listen to the other person's point of view as I found it difficult to keep going because of the hypothetical situation you know we were talking it about it early Yeah the second time was better right Again I was I was willing to listen to what you got and what was saying okay and I was okay have you got a problem with the yeah, erm yeah it was different erm with it only being role play it was a bit erm difficult to keep up with it sometimes and actually keep it going like, erm if it was the real life situation outside right you'd know that the person you were talking to had more had been through that situation before right we used the situation of taking faulty goods back to a shop right so you the person you'd be talking to would be erm trying to put you off to stop you getting something a a direct replacement right they'd be offering you a okay, okay I understand that yeah, it was difficult to to get your what you need back because you always change what erm, okay bear that in mind, thank you al al although you you're trying to make the same but you do try and change tack a bit right erm word it a bit differently right but a when when somebody when it's becoming apparent that somebody is I wouldn't say is not interested in your little complaint that you've got and that that they're they're trying to change to subject it's difficult to keep them on it right But erm I felt er are the he did alright because he I don't think he was trying to change the subject he was trying to justify it right But er, what what had happened as opposed to trying people trying to get right but er but that was the only thing really it was difficult Okay, it is difficult, okay good. I I agree it is it's very difficult to do when it's not in a real life situation Difficult to do when it's in a real life situation believe me it's harder to do in a real life situation than it is in a situation we've got yeah but Harder, but it might not be for you I dunno is it? er well I found it harder to do it right Because you you're not actually talking about anything in particular yeah I mean you know if if you were complaining about something or if you were asking for something you'd be asking for it because you knew what you wanted only as you said it's all about being clear about what you want yes, yes it is true erm if if like I mean for instance we weren't clear about what we were talking about right okay so there's a big difference okay good point and that is that is a point, that you need to be clear about what you want to role plays on as good as the real thing you know but then again sometimes you know sometimes I've listened to people saying well role plays are a bit harder than real life harder than real life why are we talking about being assertive now. You know yeah may be may be and it is difficult situations do it but I think some of the problem comes in that it's very difficult for us to to stick with the point and hear ourselves say the same thing over and over again because it doesn't feel right how many how many of you didn't feel right doing doing what you were doing? How many of you? Don't want to be repetitive do you? That's right don't want to feel you don't want to be a pain yeah Mm and you carry on but sometimes sometimes it is the only way to do it stick with what you say and keep going. Now yes there are times when other people give you arguments and will try and change it around and and you know yes we will listen to them and will agree that but what we want to know is ultimately is what's going to be done about it. Now what's gonna be done about the way we feel is anything gonna be done about it, is the other person taking note of what way we feel and are they gonna do something about it or are they trying to dismiss it? And I think what we're trying to do is to see that we're being treated fairly just as we might listen to that person's argument as well. So it's not a case of just really being listened to, it's not just a case of just being clear, clear in terms of what you want by telling people what you want, and then finding out if they're going to do it. So assertive is just being clear in what you want being prepared to keep going until you've got something along those lines rather than letting people dismiss you or make you feel as though they've dismissed you and your point not being considered i.e. your point not being heard or going away feeling that your point you didn't have a fair crack because you didn't give your point properly. It's just a case of being true to what you feel and being true to yourself giving yourself as good a chance as any of being heard. I've got a little graph up here now one thing about communication and with good communication what you can do is you can actually increase trust and co-operation amongst people. You know if you communicate well with people what happens? Trust increases because if you can talk to people openly and they talk to you openly and you're communicating then you're quite trusting with that person. If your communication is good and you can work together to increase that co-operation and co-operation gets better really puts us with trust and co-operation puts us on a high scale. These are the two real components that we need from people, everybody needs to get trust and co-operation. If you trust somebody okay you're quite open to them, they're quite open to you if you co-operate you're flexible, you're being flexible and you like to work together and what happens is is if you've got low trust and low co-operation with somebody well what you've got is really everybody both people or everybody involved being defensive constantly being def defensive, if you don't trust somebody and you know you're not co-operative you're constantly looking over your back, what are they doing are they doing that's gonna mess something up you know what are they trying to do now. Now here when you end up with a lot of having arguments and listening to a lot of arguments a lot of them are like win lose. As far as being listening to you talking today earlier on it seems to you set up in your minds a win lose situation, I'll show that. That's a win lose, you might've lost that time but you're gonna get it back another time. If we look at a relationship or any type of communication as a situation where somebody's going to win and somebody's going to lose there's not gonna be much chance of two people working together on that so what happens is somebody's got to lose. Nobody wants to lose and if nobody wants to lose it means it gets fiercer and it goes on for longer and it does takes a long time to resolve, if it ever is and often to the detriment of one person to the success of another. You don't have to be win lose all the time, because otherwise you're gonna have a battle. One person doesn't wanna lose and the other one wants to win and is going to go backwards and forwards you just end up pushing and pushing and pushing against each other, pointless. But think about it any form of any form of problem that you have arguments that you have tend to tend to develop like that. You have up here you've got neither win lose but it's like it's a respectable thing you know you respect each other you don't trust them completely and you don't co-operate completely but they just respect just not you're just not willing to go that further little bit and it becomes more of a more of a rather than a win lose or a win win it's more of a people half and half okay I'll give this much if you give that much. Now what's the word that I want it begins with a C,I'll remember it tomorrow if you ever need to talk about it tomorrow. I haven't got it written down, oh a compromise that's it yeah, a compromise . Both sides are willing to give something up okay. So nobody wins nobody loses anything and nobody really gets what they wanted out of it at the end anyway or not everything that they wanted. However, there are ways of coming up to here we've got a lot of co-operation a lot of trust and here you get what's called synergies, new names, have you heard that name before synergy, synergy? No, I'll try to explain later on. Basically it's two things coming together and becoming more than their whole, you've got two things two people working together producing more than what two people can produce it's the relationship that produces that extra little bit more. Synergy,and what happens here there is no such thing as a lose you've got win win. Both parties can get something from that situation, if you trust people and you look at things a relationship over a period of time rather than this particular thing this is what I want now this is what I'm gonna get rather than well okay I'll help you do this now and later on they'll help me do something else, it becomes a win win. Now how you watch look at the relationship what your communication's like how much trust and how much you got co-operation you've got will depend on what type of of a relationship you have. That doesn't necessarily mean that everybody is going to have a win win relationship all the time but why not go for it. What stops us from going for it, nothing stops us from going for it. Just because you're looking for win win relationships all the time that doesn't mean that you're gonna get walked over all the time because by being assertive and by this is this is really what I want, what is it that you want and looking, listening to the other person's point of view as well as making sure your point of view goes across as well somewhere, somewhere in all of that through all this down here, there's a way of finding something for both people. If one person's aggressive and the other one's submissive win lose. We're not looking at that point of view we're looking at more like working together to find a solution. It takes a little bit of a little bit of maturity a little bit of communication skills and not everybody's got that. So who does the responsibility come down to in the end? It comes down to you, us you can't blame the other person, the other person's what the other is you've got no right to change that other person ever. That person is that person it's the way they are. The only person you've got a right to change is yourself. Therefore if you've got a relationship with somebody and all you seem to constantly to be doing is constantly arguing and it's either I win or you win you're never gonna get out of that unless other time. If we look at a relationship or any type of commu mean taking a bit of a different look at things thinking well what is it that this person wants from me and what is it that I want from this person? And when you can be clear about what it is you want and be clear what it is they want you've got more of a chance to get the solution to win win rather than if you're just interested in your position and your side. Any comments? Any comments No right no Alright, if it's so easy why don't we all do it what stops us Because you don't want to be the one to let go To let go It's a case of if I do what's gonna happen if the other person don't do it right I can trust trust, trust, somebody's gonna do it somewhere otherwise it just escalates But surely to if you've been working with your partner for a long time he's gonna it anyway Yeah I agree with that, if you know somebody well, especially if you know somebody well and if you work with people and you communicate with people you build up trust, and if the communication's there and people are talking to each other and passing on information, information's going round and round trust'll be there, the only time trust disappears is when somebody feels somebody's keeping something back. Not giving all of the information. When you work with people and you communicate you listen to what they say and you make sure you say what you need to say then that trust is there and that trust builds and it fosters trust, and really that's what we've gotta be looking for in the work situation. The problem with the work situation is that sometimes we tend to settle in, and there are you know, there are people who it's very very difficult to be trusted, to be trusting with to be co-operative with because we tend to feel that they're not the trusting or co-operative type. Maybe that's a mistake we've made and that's the way we've turned it round looking at people. Maybe there are other ways and other ways of forming relationships without people getting to know that person or working with that person. Maybe just listening. The onus is on nobody else, it's on you. You know and there's no such thing as failure, at the end of the day there's only results. So you know you might think well I just can't get on with him. Well all that means is that you just haven't got on with him so far, or you haven't quite found the right way to get on with that person yet. Gonna stop there. I'll want you to think about that tonight, I'm gonna hand out a few sheets that might might explain a little bit of synergy erm I believe synergy this is my this is more of a sort of worldly view. Now I'm not I like I like the thought of but I prefer the thought of in work and how people can work together using this type of thing and think about it in the context of work rather than in the context that it talks about erm and it'll be interesting to talk to you tomorrow so if to see what you think have the think about the things we've talked about. Tomorrow we've got quite a lively day ahead of us erm by the time we do our group work tomorrow first thing in the morning, and also tomorrow after that you'll be doing a role play as well using the things that you've picked up today and seeing how many of them you can practice and put into action what you talked about. Fun day, more fun than today and today I hope I've provided some of the ground work can't there's a lot of things I would've liked to have gone into more detail and generally I do but today there's just there's just not enough time in a day to do it. You know communications is a very big area there's a lot to be talked about erm certainly rapport and leading and things like that you asked for that we could've done a lot more with, the type of language people use we could do a lot more with but when we've got a limited time we're gonna have to take a limited snapshot and I hope that what we've done so far today you found useful and I hope when we put it into practice tomorrow maybe you can understand a little bit more of some of things that we've been talking about today. Please have a think you know have a think about some of the things have a look out if you get out anywhere tonight watching people when they're together just watch them any ideas that you have tomorrow we'll start off with the first ten minutes just going over some of the things we talked about this evening. Thanks very much for your time it's five o'clock have a nice evening and I'll see you in the morning. Nine o'clock tomorrow okay?the things that we've talked about you know the complete of the company worker and you're happy with those Oh yeah okay, okay thanks I think in certain aspects as as a team member it could be me er low in dominance I mean that that certainly is me right erm I know it's easy to say but I was prepared to anyone says which is obviously you know what I'd be prepared to do right erm but I'm not the sort to sort of push meself forward in front of other people right try to put my views forward okay erm extrovert I don't quite know about that alright, the terms extrovert and introvert here I mean we've had two comments on those are used slightly different. Extrovert doesn't necessarily doesn't necessarily isn't necessarily you know the image the popular image of an extrovert which means you know somebody who's always the loudest noise at the party and always that's that's really slightly not quite right picture of an extrovert. Or likewise an introvert doesn't necessarily mean it's a person who doesn't talk to anybody who keeps themselves to themselves and is a miserable, it's not like that at all. What it basically means is that an extrovert tends to tends to have a wide area of interests but won't investigate them as much as perhaps that that deeply, and that includes friends as well, and that includes people around them and they look at the wideness rather than the depth. Introverts are more the other way round whereas they've got narrow interests, narrow fields of interest but they look at them in depth. Likewise with friends they've probably got fewer friends but the friends they have got are very close friends and they know them on a much deeper level. That's really the interpretation of extrovert and introvert and the fact that it can apply to you know being loud and gregarious as an extrovert or being quiet and keeps to himself as an introvert that's more of a popular view which isn't the sort of thing we're trying to put across. It's more of the way that you see things. Wide and not so deep for an extrovert, very narrow very deep for an introvert that type of thing alright. So don't put too much emphasis on that. So you've probably got a wide amount of interests Yeah, yeah But you don't got you might not have one that you go into specifically in too much detail Not particularly, no Alright Okay, like friends probably got a lot of friends yeah and then maybe only one or two or three other interests you got you go to into very deeply the rest are just sort of friends yeah, that's okay, well that's extrovert so we in that particular instance. Alright did that make it make it a little bit better? Yeah Okay good I agree with the a I'll jump into things first and yeah and get bored half way through somebody else Um could be worked out. Yeah speaking about it because I do like to Okay The Chairman, Okay well don't worry don't worry he can't you know just think of something though having said that if you look at the role that you played in the group moving towards the chairman's style, taking over the group perhaps becoming and you weren't a person that sort of took over and forced your views on everybody but you were certainly up there at the front with and listening to people taking information and manipulating everything that you had to fit what was coming in from everybody so that does show Chairman's skills, Chairman tendencies Yes, it was subconsciously though Well perhaps in the future that it might be one thing that you might want to lift up and develop as time goes on well done mate. Is it, Is it? I mean there there's very heavily team worker isn't it? Yeah, yeah A person that would like to share their with everybody that's a classic team worker to me yeah that's a team worker, alright, okay. Now having said all this you know let's not identify with these too much like the that's me you know okay, it gives you an incl an idea of your in of your stance where what sort of attitude philosophy and behaviours you prefer to have within a group, okay and if you match those back to what we saw in the group erm then it's not surprising that the group got on so well together and you know we didn't have too much conflict with the amount of team workers involved because nobody in there wanted to upset anybody else in the team. You know that's really why why we've got so many team workers isn't it? And I mean I put an asterisk down there to say that's what I thought was going to come out quite heavily simply because this is is the case on these courses, you know the people that we get on these courses every single one of these that we've had, and we must have had coming up to what over ten now, every single one we've had people that the most the majority of people have had team work very high on the score. I wonder if it's something to do with the job that you do or the people you have to work with I don't know but that's generally the tendency of people in these groups, team workers come out quite highly. Let's go through all the different bits and see why, I mean all these all these type of things would indicate a different type of person different types of personality. Company worker and team worker are very very similar, except the team worker is more of a person that's interested in the other people within that team, whereas the company worker's more interested in the organisation of the company itself. You know so it's it's it's six of one and half a dozen of the other really, but the company worker learns to be the guidelines the rules the routines of the company and er also really backs up the company line you know and what they're doing for them really is for the company. Big big quite a big priority there so and you know are obviously people that like them like the guidelines that come with the company like the ideas of belonging to the company and like the ideas of actually extolling the virtues of the company and following the company policy. Ah Chairman. Chairman's the person that can sit in with the group of people and is good in terms of receiving information from people and disseminating information and giving it back out again making sure that everybody's being brought in so he's a person really not not so much a leader but he will be a person who can keep the group together and can make sure that all the information flows around the group and that everybody's getting a fair say a fair crack of the whip in terms of what's going on in terms of orienting towards a task, so everything's towards a task you need towards a task. The Chairman will make sure that it stays going in that direction and everybody works together rather than against each other so you got a high score there you know and as we asking you. And they want to get rid of the buses down Station Lane. But where do they want to send them? They really don't care where they send them so long as call up up Edingley Hill what They School Lane. What what I did say that Halam had already objected to them going down Station Lane at Edingley which we did. And so they they virtually what they said was would we would we again renew our pledge that they came through Edingley. Good idea. Now one at a time Harry. We could do without the stop the buses altogether. Well if it doesn't pay you're not going to them. We can't pick go round Norwood Gardens and not want to do it. We didn't object to the buses going down Station Lane before. All we asked was if it was possible for them to come through Halam and go down School Lane to pick to get an extra bus service at Halam. They said that wasn't possible and I think I'm the same opinion as Harry if you're writing off and stop them going down Station Lane they'll probably withdraw it altogether. Yeah. I'm also concerned that if they went down School Lane, although I think it you know I understand they've got to go to Norwood Gardens and things, that with the car park at The Plough now being blocked I mean School Lane at peak times for schools is a nightmare. And I think trying to get a bus through there as well would be absolutely lethal. Well I'm putting it to you it's up to you I don't mind. I mean it's Well as I say it is a different company now. Well I I think we can There's two companies. One one at a time Tony please. I I don't think they'd sort of hold up their arms and say well we'll finish altogether if that's your attitude. We can at least answer them couldn't we. They can always say no. Richard? I would suggest that it'd be a good idea to give . It would be beneficial to this village if they Well if they've got to pick up at Norwood Gardens how's the bus going to get to Norwood Gardens. They don't run a bus With with your permission I'm gonna ask Mr if he can recall the argument. Did they not say that these buses did not pick up at Norwood Gardens didn't they? They went direct. I think their suggestion was that they had to go via Norwood Gardens because they then turned right at the in and went up into the middle of and it was to get them on to that line that they had to go through . But they did say I think distinctly that they did not pick up at Norwood Gardens. There was another pathfinder service that goes down to Norwood Gardens . There is another pathfinder service that starts there. I mean you were at the meeting that's why I'm referring to you . I mean that's er that's what was said. service from Norwood Gardens goes to Nottingham. Yes but as I've I've seen many a bus coming towards Norwood Gardens goes round the little and back out again. As I understand it from what was said at Edingley it wasn't necessary for these buses to go to Norwood Gardens because they were well served without. I don't know. That's the trouble with being car drivers isn't it ? Do do you wish to take any action. You're you're proposing Tony that we do write to the bus company again and ask if the buses can come through just say through Halam rather than go down Station Lane at Edingley? You're second I would second that yes. Is anyone against that proposal? Are you all happy with that? Yeah fine yeah. Thank you. As long as the driver's to go through Halam and not Writing to what? Writing to the bus company and ask that the buses if the bus service can be diverted from going down Station Lane at Edingley to coming up Edingley Hill and through Halam to improve the service through the village. Alright got that. And bus company did you know. So long as they don't do it at those two times a day . What what I do suggest is you know the clerk at Edingley Yeah yeah. ring her up and have a word with her and she'll probably send you a copy of the letter she sent she should have done that. Yes. And er yes have a word with Pat and so that you're both writing along the same lines. Could we qualify that that we do not want them to go down School Lane? Yeah but if I don't see how go down Norwood Gardens otherwise. This way they they could tip over on the grass verge couldn't they? Very easily. If they're not picking up at Norwood Gardens they're they're Well that's that's what we understood at Edingley meeting and there was That's correct yes. no need for them to go to Norwood Gardens or or they they specifically didn't go to Norwood Gardens they just went through didn't they? Yes it's been understood that it was a routing thing to put them at the right side of Southwell to drive through the middle of it. Yes. What I don't understand if all they need to do is revert back to what they used to be and come straight through on the on the ordinary route. That's what we're really asking for yes. Yes. We've already got that service. Every two hours. Ah every two hours and it can make it every every hour. Which is what it used to be of course isn't it? Yeah because if you want to go to Southwell at the present moment you go on a bus and you got to wait two hours to get one back. Yeah. Well we've already agreed now that we write to them Yeah that's fine yeah. And I did s I did say through the village Harry so that we didn't er I really feel School Lane's out . Which way we go through the village doesn't really matter does it? Yeah it does cos no one 's Well they not They might go down Hill Lane instead . Can we get back to to other other matters arising please. Erm I not sure I er Don Don's planning application is approved. I understand it's passing erecting, there's been a problem with the erection of things. Er bus shelter. What what was Mrs 's reaction to that? Oh dear. Oh dear. Yeah well. Thank you I haven't very much but er I haven't seen her since as I was No she thanks you very much for that but er No go. She's just not interested. Just not interested. When you get report into this news was that factually correct? Or was I think what was in the village news it arose out of those children's survey down there and what happened was that Mrs didn't think we'd er put in perhaps as politely as we should. I don't quite know how to to put this but but er she found what was in the village news offensive. You Tony could be cleaner the bus shelter . So we're ba we're basically I'm deciding what Joyce said. You wrote it let him clean it. Basically we're looking for a we're looking for another cleaner. And I don't know whether anybody's been successful. Any ideas or I actually took all those letters home and I went and I listed all the things that were listed er mentioned in all the letters and also that I tried to consider giving you know my impression of the meeting and tried putting exactly what what they're saying. And I put it down entirely factually from all the letters you know. It it's one of those unfortunate things that I mean I think we've we've got to look around and see what we can do about. Do we do we ad did we advertise for one before village meeting? Yes we have done yes. What recently? No twenty year ago. No no no I mean since this. We we've used it for things like the street clean Street cleaning and things like that. and erm assume there's no reason why we shouldn't do it erm this way. It's er I mean it's the only thing to do isn't it? To advertise for somebody. Oh yes. Are you all agreed to that? Yes. Thank you. Might get somebody to do it half price. There was something else that came up out of the minutes. Can I Yes there was. mention it? And I've got several other things. Oh alright go on. There's the there's the names there's the stone erm the allot I'll deal with the stone for the last because I thought there might be more discussion on that. Halam Hill that Yeah. The work is not satisfactory yet. The buil the I've rung them up and they said they'd do it. The hole's got worse at the top of the hill. So I rung them again and said it was dangerous and they came out more or less straight away and did the few holes at the top. Yeah. They have put yellow marks round some of the holes but haven't been back to do them yet. No there're great big yellow marks across the road with big arrows facing down into the village now. I don't know what they mean. They've been they've done before I believe. Oh have they? Oh. They have started the work but it isn't complete and I was going to say it's not satisfactory yet. budget. There's one on Back Lane as well I haven't reported that one. One at a time yeah. So Well well I say I rang them first time. Nothing happened. The holes got bigger on top of the hill so I rang them again saying they're dangerous for cyclist for a motorbike could have an accident. And they did come out more or less straight away and well I say drop a bit in But they are aware of the situation on the hill and they haven't been yet. That's all I can tell you. Mind you I should think they've got holes absolutely everywhere aren't there. The roads are terrible they are dreadful. Oh it's terrible terrible all over the place. Can can we couple with this there's the room pavilion, can we coupled with this New Hall Lane. I've been away all this week because my wife took a telephone message from Nora yesterday and it is it is in our parish . It is dreadful I walked along there the other day. It's appalling. and er he said that when they took it up three years ago of course they from the first six months I think it is and we got on to them and they they did agree They did yeah. But since then nobody's done anything about it. It it's in a terrible state it really is. So so can we ask the clerk to look into that and couple it with Back Lane as well. And Back Lane as well. It's only one but it's quite a good one I think . And somebody's reported a bad pot hole near your house Harry. Mrs Mrs rang me up and ask me about the one Somewhere a big hole hole down between her drive and the road. Where the water's stuck and it keeps coming down and it's getting quite wide where anyone could slip in. And that you know they leave they've left it for er two years It's going to cost so much money to get all this right in the end isn't it? It's a false economy. But now now's now's the time strike on because for two reasons. Because of course the county council have And we all know why. and secondly it's coming to the end of the financial year and this is when they want to spend the money. So I think now's the time to er make a bid for all these. So is it agreed the clerk write to them again about all the ones we've listed? Well shall we mention School Lane then because that is absolutely Yes we might as well. appalling. The sides of the road are giving way aren't they ? They are yes. You have to stop They seem to be happening daily. I mean it's just getting worse and worse and worse. And perhaps perhaps Pat could we ask could we ask for a site meeting with them? And see if they'd somehow. That that's the best way and then you and I could perhaps walk round with them or ride round with them and show them. I used to be able to do that. But the last time I tried they didn't want to know because well nobody will take responsibility. No I know. At the end of the day. But they seem to get things done at Edingley at site meetings. They they've Well I'll try for a site meeting. They've er they've done fairly well there with Perhaps if it's happen to be a time when I'm busy Richard you might do it as vice chairman. If I'm available yeah. Some or one of us will anyway. If we can fix a meeting a date up to suit them Yeah. and one of us will fit in. Right fair enough. Right. Allotment hedge edging I've got down here. Yeah we spade work. we er spoke spade work that sort of told you about, spade work recommended a list of do work. He's billed them and they pay out direct. That's fine. So Hang on just a second. I was walking that way with Ernest on Saturday and he said he thought the bottom hedge belonged to anyway. Well I don't think that's right No. I I don't I don't think that's right Glynis because That's okay then. I just thought I'd mention it because I didn't want anybody That that hedge was cut by David 's father last time Oh that was a good long time ago wasn't it? Yes yes. Albeit I think it was done for the parish council so. Right okay. That's okay I just thought that you should know that . Well we're we're quite I mean we agreed to it last time and if the billing's going to go direct we we can we can forget about it now . Yeah oh yeah. All we've got to see is somebody that wanders up there just see that the work's done satisfactorily. I'm sure it will be. Well like keep and eye on it anyway. Yeah. Right now the only the only other item I've got er rising from the minutes is the stone and the names. Now just to complicate the issue who probably probably is the oldest person in the village I'm note sure, erm has brought another name to my attention. And she's even gone to the extent of checking on the stone which is a memorial in churchyard of the. The person in question was a relative of hers and was killed or died I'm sure not whether he was killed or died but certainly served in the forces in the four fourteen eighteen war in he was buried in . But there is a there is a er inscription on the stone in the churchyard to him. So that makes four now. Have have you found out any more the cost Harry of this? Yeah for a stone that is ? Yes. Inlaid stone into the brickwork. A stone of about eighteen inch four by four with the appropriate heading I would have thought up to four names, depending on how many names there is in the Yes. village. Er between a hundred and thirty and a hundred forty. That doesn't sound out of the way to me. Mind you if you do it properly and you put their rank and regiments and things Ah well that well that like that on it it makes it a lot more expensive wouldn't it? I said I didn't think probably that would be but I wasn't sure. But anything extra like that would be extra. Of course. Yeah mm. I mean if it's if it is a war memorial which it is I said to just the name of the person who'd died in the . That that's all we're looking for at the moment. And if we want to put rank and Yeah. I mean you'd be doubling that wouldn't you? Yeah yeah the writing is pretty It is it is. Because you're paying by so many letters usually. Usually on memorial stone you just put the initials and the name don't you? You do. I wouldn't I wouldn't bother with rank. No I wouldn't. Because I wasn't sure whether he get it right anyway. Not unless it's proper And and they don't know the date. I don't know it would have on the date actually. No it was really a case of things were residents Just four names really. residents of the village who lost their lives in the nineteen fourteen eighteen war isn't it? After all You think that would cover the situation. Well considering nothing's been done for fifty year I suppose really . Yeah. Matter of of people who'd died in the first world war. could be more. Well we've advertised in the village news and Miss Clark's the only one that's come up with anyone. Probably the only one who's got a member in . Yes. I mean she's I haven't heard any comment from people at all about it. Whether they willing that we I mean Well that's what we elected for I just I mean in some I I I'm afraid Harry I'm one of those that we take our our responsibility and if they don't like what we're doing they can What you mean is they had chance. They've had chance . Well they've had plenty of chance haven't they? Does that include erecting it Harry? Well no it's just the stone. Well no no no no. If they're gonna have to cut hole out and put it in. Well no won't it be built in. Well I thought the idea was to put it on one of the original walls though. Not on one of the new walls. Well it won't be on it'll be in. It'll still have to be cut in though wouldn't it? Yeah If it's no I think what we agreed Glynis if it was going to be a stone it could go in the wall where it could be seen from outside. Oh right yes sorry I beg your pardon . But if we were deciding on a brass plaque or something Yeah. like that then it would be It would have to be inside. And I for what I'm trying to do I didn't think we'd be able to afford a stone I thought I thought it would be much more than what Mr 's quoted. I still think the plaque might be cheaper. Oh it would be cheaper but I'm not sure whether it would be Then the brass plaques tend to get taken off and happens where a stone remains. So with this this stone could be built in so that it's facing the road couldn't it? That's right. Exactly like these are in this place. Like the ones out here yes. Been in there for a long time aren't they? Yes. Been there for a hundred years haven't they? Well they're all part of the history aren't they? Great memorial I think really isn't it? Beg pardon? Be a good appropriate memorial if we can afford it. Well I would have thought so but Pat have you found out about the names? Yes. David was going to let you know about his relations. No. He asked me to contact the War Commission. Yeah. He asked me to contact the The War Graves Commission. War Graves Commission. I haven't found them yet. We've found everybody but them. I've got the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. No you haven't. No not on the Well I think we do because I yeah it seems so Well if it's yes. The Salvation Army were trying the community council the local community council. Just phone the Citizens Advice Bureau they'll help you best. We didn't try them. But nobody else could find the address. If the Commonwealth War Commission don't know how to get hold of the War Graves Commission The Commonwealth War Graves Commission can give us the information we want provided we can give them the christian name of the person and the regiment. Then Ah well. They otherwise suggest they otherwise suggest er If we knew that we don't need them. chasing back to the local paper to the approximate time that we think they died see if they report enough about them. Or go back to your local paper to the end of the war to see if they were all honorary. Furthermore, they're they can can't get any information on deaths that would have occurred from injuries after the war. None at all. Well we're not looking for those anyway are we? Well there was one query wasn't there? Yes. Even for the thirteen fourteen year? Oh it would have been a long while after the war yes. In fact I don't think it was. No. I mean I wasn't born until nineteen thirty and I mean I I I can remember Jim well so he didn't die until probably nineteen forty. How how many years after? Fourteen fifteen year after Yes. So if you're gonna talk about him what about Jimmy I mean That's right. It's not relevant then is it really? No. No. I I think these are fellows that were either killed or died on active service. And I mean this one that Miss Clark's mentioned he probably died on active service through wounds or something like that . Well he's the least of the problem because if he's got something in the churchyard there'd be something dated probably . was actually going to get the information for tonight but she hasn't been able to and I haven't seen her. But she was trotting off to the churchyard to clean the stone the other day. Yes I was just trying to think as to who it was to be quite honest. I know which it is but it's somewhere down in the corner where your brother used to live that corner down there Harry somewhere down there. So we've got four definites at the moment. Mm. So in that case we've got to do a bit of research haven't we? Well I've got the Ah. Let's let's have the Well well you've just said we've got four definites. Well now you're saying that the one that was injured wasn't one. The one that died after the war Right Richard. that was his name Yes yes. nothing more. He was a member of the Sherwood Foresters mentioned in despatches died nineteen sixteen approximately. Was he anything No. No he was a relative There was a Tommy used to come here you see. I'll I'll I'll I went to cows one morning and they started Well do not let too many skeletons out of cupboards. Very naughty. The reason the reason we know it was nineteen sixteen was the fact that someone named died Which one Richard? The reason we know it's not it was nineteen sixteen er that had been killed was that he was home obviously at the beginning of the war he went off and then someone named left a house well left they died and the proceeds of the house were left to Mrs Miss 's grandmother. And to Seth. And Emma's mother got both lots of money because Seth was deceased and so was Oh yeah So we've Seth this one of Miss Clark's relations we can trace that. So we're really struggling on two . Some people say it's cos he's got a thing in the church don't they? can you can you chase David when you get home? Yes it's in the window. You've got this you've got this information off Richard I'll make sure excuse me, you get the information from May Clark. You chase it up from David . Now who does that leave us with? Er one more? Yeah er Clark the one in the one in the or ? . oh. Is there anything in the village book? Just another point of interest to you people just a little thing that dropped out was that Mr er Mr died Yes. and the and the same day as they buried Mr . of the shock? Yeah. He died in nineteen hundred and ten and that was the same day It says here Mr died on the same day as Mr St er was buried . You'd better get slimming then. Mm there you are you see. Anyway he was nineteen ten so I thought it would be interesting. Yeah but it was different But he was I tell you he was resurrected again. But er yeah so we've we we've got a fair bit of information on three. It's that we're struggling on. How would we find out about then. He's got to go to the War Graves on that Well in that case we we need a christian name do you have a christian name for him? I haven't no. And well Miss Clark might remember I mean she is as you say probably one of the oldest people and perhaps Miss could rattle her brains a little. Who else might know? I think er came to visit who did she come to visit? Well then ask either then may be. My dad will remember his name. Oh well ask him then David. That's the answer then isn't it? Yes. Yeah. Ruby she'll have she'll have some children though because I mean they're somewhere down in they're somewhere down in Gillingham down in Kent Yeah they're down in Kent. Yeah but you know after such a time with children there is something like that No I I I honestly don't know I mean we fetched Mrs home to bury her but I mean that was oh nineteen fifty odd. Can't remember the address. No we can't. I know it's somewhere near Tonbridge Wells because that's Ask ask Ida. probably with Jim and er his brother being buried . I wonder if he'd carried all the information Oh Ida will know if anybody does. I mean she's the link person in that family. can you have a word with Ida then? Okay. Or David what about you? You just want 's name don't you? Well want as much information about any of them but er but I think we can find er sufficient about the others. But it's 's name yeah. I'll ask my dad. He he told me but I forgot. I'm sure he told me when I was asked Oh well that we'll leave that with you then. Old Jack and so and so and so. It might be possible otherwise to go would it be in the local paper. I don't know I don't know. What would have been the local paper then the Advertiser still or what was perhaps the precursor of the Advertiser yes . There was the Newark Advertiser and the Newark Herald in those days. Newark Herald. But I would have thought that one lot of er papers would either have gone to the archives office or er been retained in the Advertiser if they amalgamated at some time. Another possibility is the censors for eighteen nineteen one which is the last one you can look at. There's a hundred year secrecy on them you know. Yeah. If he was born by then before then and lived in the village his name would be in the censors. Possible that there would be of course. I mean I don't . But a lot of people went quite young didn't they? younger than twenty three presumably. Probably mm yeah. If they were born in the village they could well be in the erm baptismal book in church . This this is first of all can we I should tell you that the planning permission for this is passed. The district council has no objections and of course the county's granted themselves planning permission on it Yes. and that actually came through this morning. So so they will now be getting on with it fairly quickly. So if we're going to do anything We'd better get on with it. we've got to act fairly quickly so can we decide in principle whether we're going to do this or not and let them know that we either are or we aren't. That's the important thing. Oh yes. You you've got the original letter there haven't you? Yes. So can we have a decision in principle whether we're going to do this or not? They they don't want any further payment for doing it on our behalf do they? No what we were invited to do. We were invited to provide as the parish council we were invited to provide a stone with the details on. And presumably their builder would build it in for us. Yes. I propose that we get on and do it a fast as possible. I'm going to second that. Thank you. That's all agreed. Yes. Thank you very much. That's a unanimous decision. Richard how far does the christening go back in church the baptismal book? Beg pardon? They start building on the twentieth of March. How long is it going to take to get the stone cut Harry? If we can take it back to about eighteen ninety I've no idea this time. I'd have to ask him again about that. We've got, can I have a bit of attention please. We've gone back quickly so I've been informed that build that's definite starting on the twentieth of March. Well there's two projects running side by side. Erm which they start they're supposed to be running together at the same time when they'll start I don't know. But er Well they're gonna start on the twentieth of March They'd better start doing something. so they'll want this pay the month's wages. Well it's only it's only No we've got to pull that It isn't Well it's only coming out a yard isn't it? They might not do that On the other hand on the other hand they could leave get the exact measurement right and leave a hole. There's no problem about that. The thing to do is have a word with Martin . Why why? Well he's hurt his hand hasn't he? No. No no no no. Oh he said he he's like tendering the er the erm project people doing the tendering. No. probably going back to it. But anyway we've got a tight we've got a tight time scale . Nothing Martin says so. That's the important thing. We've got a tight time scale so we've got to do this reasonably. Give them the measurement they the hole. I will is it agreed we just put the names on? I think I will I will get the get the information If that's a suitable inscription. as regards. You're going to chase David up you're going to chase up and you've already provided the information as regard Seth . So that's the so we've got it covered. And when we get it all together you and I'll get together and we'll draw something out ready for the next meeting to either agree approval or or yeah? We weren't going to say just the names initials initials and initial Yes that's why I want the christian names. We want the initials but not the rank and Yeah. If you don't see David have a look in the church It's the St Michael window I think. It's in the St Michael window just round back of the door. Yeah. The little door there it tells you The name of it on the back Yes it is it is Yes that's right it's all there yes so there's no problem. I'll have a look on Sunday morning and see if erm erm baptismal book I didn't realize I didn't realize we had such a tight schedule and it reminded me when they got the plan, well I don't know when it came through, but I opened it today and. Right now then that's dealt with all the matters arising that I've got down. Are there are there any other matters arising from No because the hedging was the one thing I wanted to talk about . The hedging I see yes. Alright. We'll now go on to correspondence then Pat please. You've got the seminar on planning haven't you? Yes seminar on planning and law . Oh by the way, just going back to that other thing, can you let them know Harry we're definitely going to take in this Yes I'll yes I'll er contact them yes. And and at the same time ask them for a date when they want the stone . Yes Well area education office. Right correspondence. Seminar seminars for parish councils on planning policy law and procedures. Have you come across this? Do you know anything about it ? Yes I do yes. Erm Do you want me to explain it or do you want to read it out? Yes I can explain it. Virtually what it did it came out of the last parish council's conference which I attended on your behalf and er the Director of Planning and Development, Colin promised to lay on a seminar for parish councillors because it seems to be the one service which always gets criticism at the parish council's conference. Either the district council planning committee hasn't agreed with the parish council. Or if they have agreed reasons why they haven't . And so they're laying on this seminar for as many parish councillors who want to go to explain the planning procedures. And when you've been to this you'll know more about it that what I do. The date is on the twenty eighth of March and the location will be at Hall and it will be it doesn't give a time but it will be an evening meeting. In the dome. I don't know where it could be in the dome if it's Twenty eighth is a Monday is that? Checking Glynis just checking. It is. Yes yes I've got a note in my diary that's right. Monday the twenty eighth of March. And they want to know how many's going. Edingley are sending about four and are sending about four but er as many as like want to go. But anybody who's interested in planning or you either don't agree with us. Is there a meal or anything? No No you should have gone to the one that I went to. You refused to go you see. I haven't had time Glynis. Glynis you would like to go. Yes please. That's one. Tony you would like to go? Two. Do you want to go Simon? No. He's just gonna sit and be argumentative isn't he . Richard? No Harry? What do you two know that we don't know? You'll enjoy it I'll tell you. Who's doing it. either you agree or disagree Come on. is that the whole meet what the meeting's about? Come on it's obviously something fishy about it Seminar for the parish councillors planning law and procedures. Those parish councils who were represented at the annual parish councils conference at Hall last year will recall that the suggestion was made that a special session may be held on planning topics should there be sufficient support from parish councils. And the intention would be to have three or four speakers from the planning staff here who would talk about different aspects of planning rules policies procedures etcetera. And there would then be a discussion section session. I would envisage the talk to last about sixty to seventy five minutes and the discussions for another thirty to forty five minutes commencing Oh it does say,commencing at seven thirty P M. I have earmarked Monday the twenty eight of March nineteen ninety four as a possible date and the location would be Hall. I would be grateful if you could let me know within six weeks whether your councillors wish to attend such an evening and if so how many representatives you will wish to send. You can if you wish ring extension three five one rather than send a written reply. If the demand is high we may need to limit the attendance to a maximum of three per parish council. At this stage it's not limited . It would not be the intention to discuss individual planning applications . So now then I've got two so far. There's myself anyone else? No I'm busy. Right three from Halam then Pat please. I'll be out that night. D'ya know I just wish that you'd share this inner knowledge with the rest of us. I do really. Go there on a false errand. We're all busy people aren't we? How do you know I'm on a diet? Put put three down from Halam if anybody else wants to go I'll You can turn up on the night if you want No. I want a reply to that one. Right that's seminar thank you. The second item of correspondence economic development strategy consultation. Oh yes yes it's it's for noting yes. Put your name in it like. Put your name in it and pass it on. That's the other one thank you. What's this scratch roof? Oh that's this er they want they can all have one of these. Not even a hand round one. It's the er one from Oh yes yes I see yes. Yes got their . There you are David I bet you picked one up in your And that's the district council newsletter coming round. Oh I've got I've got one of those yes. When is this erm commission due to report in April. Oh yes. Ah but they've erm It's been put back. I was going to say they've isn't it? The I can't remember the exact date but what I can tell you is those of you that take the Newark Advertiser and the exact dates are in today's Newark Advertiser. Oh I haven't read that then. But it has been put back. We expect the findings the final findings to be in the Autumn of this year now. September this year. But if the Government keeps changing its mind and it's then it really is Oh it is a pain isn't it? It's a very expensive undertaking all this and it's such a waste of our money I suspect . And you see now what the Government have said that they are going to accept that there are going to be two key authorities in some counties. Because their own backup their own back benches in rural counties are kicking up so much in Somerset and Hampshire in particular that they've had to back down. But well I mean I think they've reported they've gone down. I think local Government's gonna be an absolute pigs ear if you've got two tiers two tiers in one county and and authorities in another. I mean well I don't know but there you are. I don't really It's had everything else it goes the full circle in the end doesn't it? Rural rural voice here we all look through. I will say this Mr chairman Newark district council is much more appreciative of you can't put but you could the Notts county council one. They've guaranteed costs down. That's all I can say. Your not with me? Your all with I bet the whole thing is going to cost millions of pounds. Course it is course it is. We never it never ought to the exercise never ought to have gone out Harry. I mean that thing I went to on Wednesday it must have cost thousands of pounds. A total waste of money really. But it was a Government decision. And I want You've all read this from have you? I've read I want to stress this please I want to stress this. When I say it was a Government decision I'm not speaking politically because whoever had've won the last election whether it be Liberal Democrats Labour or Conservative all three parties were committed to reorganizing local government. God knows why but all three parties were. So the outcome of the last general election made no difference at all. It will take year and years to recoup They'll never recoup it never. Right. The final on the correspondence is highway briefing. You deal with this and Right well we've had these before. It's highway It's all in the Advertiser Mr chairman. Right As Mr it's all in the Advertiser. It's all in the Advertiser. The highway briefing we get one each month out. Tells you what major road er roadworks going to take place. Major maintenance schemes to start in the next month include Danby Road Newark Road and to Road Have we any in our Pat near us that are affected? No. We're going from that's the nearest. Oh well. Well done Pat. As from as from April nineteen eighty four. The word children will be removed from school crossing patrol sticks and will be replaced with the children crossing signal. Erm you can have a look look through if you want. No you can when they're doing these repairs You wonder who dreams these things up don't you? in your back lane Traffic traffic close it to both ends. traffic management the A two the A six one two Nottingham Road at Southwell er closed to extended thirty mile an hour speed limit. Er By a hundred meters further out Oh they they've applied for that at the bottom of Road isn't it? So anybody wants to have a look at these says it's not viable. Well if they take as long to do it I mean good heavens there's been one clanking manhole cover at Halam and it has taken them weeks to do it. And they've got traffic lights up again today. You know where you It's a sewer that's burst or something. No it's that clanking manhole cover. No. Yes it is cos they've resealed it again today. Right that's the actual clerical correspondence. Can we go on and that's the bill for the tables is it? Bill for the tables a total of one hundred and eight pounds ten pence. A hundred and eight pounds ten pence. I'm gonna make a note of that. When I'm complaining I might just as well Pay that price. Is it your wish that er about the same price for a table Well work out a fifteen Is it your wish we should pay this account? Yes. Thank you. Then we come to, oh the general consensus of opinion was yes. I never heard a word uttered except mine. Well David was nodding his head and that Richard. Is it is it agreed that we pay the account for the tables? Yes. Thank you. Ooh can I just mention while we're while we're on about tables, well we're not really on about it, but can I just mention it. Harry and I thought at one stage that if we could find a proper home Oh yes yes I wondered what you were going to say. Pinned And they wouldn't actually cause so much damage to the paint work all the way round didn't we? We ought to devise a scheme and an area So they didn't scratch the wall. That's right yes. Will they fit into the porch? Well They'd never get carried in there I don't think. one particular place They would but I doubt if any did you not? Well we just thought somewhere at the back where we could pin them against the wall. I think that's sensible. Well basically two up the wall to lean against basically. And probably a strap that comes round Some sort of clip to hold them in so that erm Every time a table it scratch the wall. Is it agreed that we ask Richard if he could deal with this for us please? We'll devise something Harry. You know you know what you want. You know what you want. Strung up to the ceiling. So as you don't ask me to get the so and so's down. Right. Now the clerk's got any other business down here and the date's two meetings past. No well you see. The annual parish meeting and the annual parish council meeting. Just advise you on the dates of last year. Last year we had the annual parish meeting on the thirtieth of April. Yes. And the annual parish council meeting on the fourteenth of May. Well that's how I've got the corresponding dates. So if you want random dates. If you want to settle them at this meeting. Cos they want settling No I don't they? It's a good idea yes to settle the next meeting. What d'ya mean. Why under any other business for? I saw planning on the A G M on the the You can see what you like. There isn't any there isn't any official but I've got one that I'll show. Can we just deal with this please. Well that comes It came as a great surprise to me for some reason or other . What date are we looking at? May the thirtieth that was a Friday. Yeah you're not tied to them dates at all. Just giving you an idea of when you had them last year. The corresponding date is the twenty ninth of April. How does that strike anybody? Yes. And that's for the parish meeting . Twenty ninth of April Is that it. Well we're all here tonight so that if we Yes. Twenty ninth of April. Start earlier. Seven thirty. Nor normally starts at seven thirty does it? Yes for the parish meeting. Well the parish meeting doesn't last very long as a rule does it? Ten minutes and it'll be done. Nobody comes. Might be a surge. Harry and a couple of other faithfuls and that's it. What time? Seven thirty? Seven thirty then. Annual parish meeting. Annual parish meeting. Seven thirty P M. And then the annual parish council meeting was May the fourteenth last year so the corresponding date will be Be the thirteenth. May the thirteenth. How does that strike you? Right. Which is the one where we carry on and have the meeting afterwards. The annual parish meeting The annual parish meeting yes. is the reporting one isn't it and we elect officers at that one do we? No no. This is the one we elect offic officers at. Officers at mm. Yes. This is the thirteenth. So what do we call this one ? parish council meeting early so that we get a committee meeting . Well we do have a committee we do have a council meeting afterwards yeah. So the annual parish The one you're on about is the A G M isn't it? The parish meeting I thought that's. We have a parish council meeting afterwards don't we? Yes. That's what I thought. Just on a technicality why do we need the two like this? Beg pardon? Why do we why can't we combine them with the parish council meeting? Because we've always done it that way. Well the annual parish we do have to have an annual parish meeting. That's statute. And we do have to have a meeting of an annual meeting of the council to elect your officers. I mean it's the annual meeting of the council that agrees the finance and everything else. Well you can have a committee meeting But we usually have we usually have a council meeting So you can start that bit earlier. Well you can start it at seven o'clock if you like I don't mind. What time I should have started the annual parish meeting at seven and followed by Is it agreed we start at seven? That's what you're talking about now is it? Parish meeting. The annual parish meeting on the twenty ninth of April seven o'clock. Followed by a parish council meeting. Yes it'll be followed by a parish council meeting. And then we're looking at May the thirteenth for the annual meeting of the parish council. Don't they call that the annual general meeting? Yes. That's at seven thirty then. Last year. Right. Now then. As you wanted some as you as you wanted some planning Glynis I haven't got any official plan this is just unbelievable planning for you but what I can show you is some sketches which the gentleman who bought the plot at Grey Lane brought to show me asked my opinion. I said it's no good asking my opinion I said it looks alright to me. I said, Take them to Hall and ask the planning officers if they'd be acceptable to them. Because it was agreed it should be a single storey dwelling and he's going for he wants a chalet type bungalow. But it it's sort of built into the ground apparently so that it'd be pretty low down. So I said, Well before you have your plans drawn up go and. He said, Well would I show the plans to the parish council and see what their reaction is. So there you are. I can't remember what their names are but somebody tells me they're are the most extraordinarily noisy family. They're not. They're er they live in at the present time and er his name's Paul and he's the main Skoda dealer in Nottingham. It isn't built into the built into the ground it's just following the the the level of the ground. It isn't built into the ground . Didn't know there was that much profit in a Skodas. And that with it being a chalet bungalow the roof goes up Their chain is in Nottingham. Yeah Where the hospital is up there. But that's not the main office they've got a big one. But I thought we wanted to keep this a low profile bungalow and that's pushing it up the same as the other one in Grey Lane went up. That's right that's right. And he isn't showing a ground level. No no. He isn't saying this is ground level at all. All he's doing is following the lie of the ground. That's a lot of artistic licence then. I I object to this. Yeah. I think we'd better switch off at this stage. Open your present then Antony. Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday dear Antony, Happy Birthday to you Shall we take a picture Go ahead. Enjoying yourself? Antony. You like my picture? Mm? No, no, no this is not made to play with I want you blow it now Antony Yes Antony, come and stand up over here now. Come over here. So the patches Yes. the patches, right now, you're on, we put you the Oestraderm fifties? Yeah. Right. Because you'd stopped the Premeren and how are you getting on with those? You've had your first month's worth. Er the first couple of weeks were fine, Yeah. I felt a lot better. But I just feel tired again, Oh it's got worse? Yeah, I'm just tired. And I notice as well er more so at night when I'm watching T VCV or even when I, I go to bed Mm. my heart starts racing and I can feel the pulses in my neck and like my throat's constricting. Mm. And I don't know why. Right. Any hot flushes? No. That I haven't had. Right. Now then you was put on Premeren it was given at the hospital, wasn't it? Yes it we because I was er my heart was racing and Yeah. er what have you there. And before that you were having er horrendous irregular periods? Yeah. Yeah. Let's have a look at er oh that's right, oh that's, that's a seven . Hmm. No, well yeah. Well I think the thing to do is to actually give you the higher dose patches. Mhm. Wh when you put people on the patches for the first time because the hormone goes straight into the system, rather than having to go through the gut, Aha. if you've been short of hormone, you'll get a big boost straight away and, and you'll get the benefits. But if it's not quite enough, although you'll get the initial benefits they, they can tend to wear off, so some people are better on the higher, some people are better on the lower dose. And it looks like you could do with more. Aha. The next step up is the hundreds, and you use them in exactly the same way, one twice a week. Instead of being round they're sort of, sort of rectangular Aha. type. Now the last person I had moved on to the hundreds had enormous problems with the stickiness of them. So if you find they're not sticking, I would be delighted to hear, cos that means it's not just this woman it's actually Aha. the patches that are causing Yeah. problems. Now in her case we put her on two fifties but that i uses up an awful lot of skin and it's a real hassle, so er I can imagine. so er I think that'd be the, the sensible thing to do. Now I checked your blood pressure only four weeks ago and that was absolutely Yeah. normal. Er what we'll do is that I'll give you another eight of these, now if they're a lot better just s give a ring in Yeah. okay? Er that's ring for repeat and wh what we'd do is give you three monthly repeats, Mm. after that, well I would, er it all depends who does the repeat prescription I suppose but er I would give you three monthly repeats. Is that okay? Yeah, that's fine. You've just got to be aware, they're a slightly different shape, and they're also bigger. Aha. And that's the other thing about it you see, you've got to stick them down carefully. But they say that they won't come off when you go swimming, and you take your clothes on and off. We shall see. Mm. Unfortunately they've got the market cornered with these patches. Mhm. One twice weekly the, so they're, there's only the these. No other firm does them so you can't say, let's try this firm's patches, cos they don't do them. Actually I found them a lot more convenient than Yeah. than the other form. Mm. Cos you tend to forget, Yes. with the pills. Yes. Some people say they're so convenient they forget these as well.
