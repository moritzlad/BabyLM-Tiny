He, He went into hospital and they said erm that it's the muscles of his heart that were affected they couldn't do anything more for him! Just sa , you know, so he said right well I might as well go home.

He probably was told to go home and take it easy, you know, and Mm. He's like me you get well like most You can't men they get fed up, that's like I know most women do the same. oh yeah bu you see, er er, you're not supposed to life anything for if one of my grandsons falls over, the first thing you do is pick him up you know!

Mm mm. Mm. Oh didn't wanna leave home, but anyway she went in and somebody said, oh it'll be about a week you know my fifth one really. Mm mm. What? Anyway, this somebody must of given her the idea, I think it was our local doctor oh you'll be alright you know, you have to have to have them in forty eight hours you see so Mhm mm. she was in this hospita , the, the City Hospital in Chester which is not used now for that. Mm. And er I do don't know which day it was but she was sitting there fed up second day I'm thinking she said well I, I'm going home tomorrow, so I said no you're staying in for the week! We Yeah. well that was it then,urgh ! Yeah Anyway she was that bad, anyone sa who she saw plus the doctor, you know oh he said, oh no! So I think they let her out the day after. Yeah. The proviso that she Took it easy , mm. I had to go there and er I could go back with her in the ambulance. Mm. And then of course, as you say strictly Yeah. no work, well No. Don't take any notice! You know what women are like, they ha Yeah. they got kids to look after, the first thing you do it's, it is silly really you know but I mean Oh I know but you're especially For working people, unless you got a maid or something, which you know wha Especially where there's children involved, I mean Yeah. you just don't think, you've, you've lifted Kids don't understand. them before you think about you shouldn't be doing that.

And he'd go once Counting, they do like the horses do in What the circus! what are the, what are these doing? I said, I don't know I need to think. Oh God, it was magic it was ! Yeah. And I look back on that and you know, nineteen Yeah. forty one, or whatever it was, forty, forty one Yeah, through the evacuation. Yeah. and it was er and then we came to er near er par Prenton Yeah. in the caravan Mm. mum and dad came to Yeah. stay in this caravan and these posh houses were ! We went there one day and my sister and I,mu , mum was in Liverpool and the sign went sister was elder sister, he was terrified, our John! And we ran to this house I said Aha!

It was And my different, yeah. my sister didn't, she was frightened No. you know the Is she a bit older than you? A couple of years older than me Mm. but she's a nervous type you know. Yeah. They'd go collecting shrapnel in the street, you know and Yeah, my brother would go out and do that, yeah! Sometimes it was warm! Yeah. Oh boy! If it happened now I'd be I'd be terrified for the kids you know! So you're It's in it's incredible isn't You it? Birkenhead lady are you? Yo ah I I was born in Liverpool and I mother, sort of a very old family a but erm In what part of Liverpool? Do you Er I was born in the it's off erm I don't suppose it's there any more erm What's the road? what is the road that comes down erm joins erm you know where the Hippodrome er, used to be? No, not at all. No, erm It's not West Derby Road, round there is it? Yes! It's at well i See when you said the Hippodrome it no, and it, no this this road comes , well there's the Hippodrome there or was, I don't suppose it's there now and you go, at this road here so it's this way on the West Derby Road comes this way I seem to remember the pub Erm called The Grapes round there, is there? The Breacon Well there was one called the Breacon Well on that road That's right! Lo , and this is, you go rou is is near to Lodge Lane and you went up round that way, it is? No, no. Erm Edge Lane? No. Prescott Road. No, Edge Lane is over that way. Got West Derby Road and Prescott Road. No, no, you're going the other way! Oh! Erm When you're coming You know, going, as if you were going to erm do you know where the erm the, the funny thing was and the Brow , Everton Brow , there was a Well I know Everton, yeah. cafe place erm what's that I use thing? Where they used to ma , yes. What wa , what is it ? But they used to make it. Yes. The I dunno I the old ladies we used make the erm Everton coffee. Coffee , yes. Erm there was like a water tower thing in erm I don't know and a piece of a green railing rai , you know, if it was railed all round. Oh I see! Erm well this road went up to erm Breckfield Road Oh yes, I remember that! Well Breckfield Road North Breckfield Road and then ran I know the name. between Beside the Cabbage Hall was it? No. Pictures? No. I don't think so. Yeah it's nineteen fifty when I left, you know, it's a long time ago! And we wha well what if that was Highton you know, not Liverpool Yeah. itself, that was a and then we moved from there to er Going out to Skelmey is it? Skelmersdale, or has tha that's gone? No, somewhere round er Queen's Drive, Oh Queen's Drive! that wo , you know at the end of erm That's nice,. Yes, it was very nice! mum liked Ooh! it, but pop didn't. Lot of doctors there and Because he printed the Echo and er when he was working late he couldn't get out there. Mm. And he missed his Mm. erm drinking partners I think. So he Oh yeah! decided that we're moving back further in you know. Mm mm back further in. Which is a pity and then of course they started throwing bombs around and we, we were, we were evacuated I see. to erm a place called Bridgenorth in between Bridgenorth and Kidderminster. I know I've se you know,Bridgenorth I've seen the signs there, I've never been there and er But the first time we went carpets, isn't that there? Where did we go first time? Lot of carpets. We we paragraphs four and five, page five the first of we will buy them including all the legislation that will reduce and if you got up to page three, paragraph six there's a claim that levels are eight percent higher on the same money! But you know,the these people ha have hardly been treated erm and a, a contract for obtaining more health care year by year so, you know if yo , if you're saying that erm these wi will will reduce or that the action has already taken place, it can't reduce erm so, then again it's, it's not really relevant to erm the proposal of running a, a health authority, you know, these people should talk . Erm I've, I I think I'll erm was talking about people attending the health authority meetings at the moment but the local health authority do move meetings around, Saffron Walden Bishop's Stortford, Harlow and and and one over at erm and this apart from it's was only us coming from Harlow at the meeting last week and the health authority met in Harlow er, you know the me the meetings are moving about, they are there for people to come to but if they're not coming to to the meetings while they're o on on the doorstep then, then really what else can the health authority do to me , to make people come? You know I erm Hugh was talking about erm somebody being thrown out of hospital after gall bladder operation after only two days well fortunately these days there are one or two strives in er in in health care erm to erm which is very much easier to er, operate on people if you're if you if you're going to put them out cos the operation's more er simpler it's far less stress on patients and and, and they they're becoming a lot quicker er, clearly if faded out er, the way is completed then er obviously things are serrated with with the chief executive of the health authority and I'd like to give you this October when when the Chief Executive was . ! Yes. Best person I think , you know. Erm there is just one, may I just er, make one final point erm paragraph on page four refers to improvements in services of minority groups and also on page five and six the need for sa input, input into priorities shall not be able to for this . One of the main purposes of o of a consortium is actually looking at the health needs erm it's impressions that I've I actually got o on a number of occasions that I've er I think involvement in assessing health needs but I've actually answered anywhere er, and I'd very interested as to how or what kind of input erm we will be looking to on that? Thank you, er Simon. Er er if they want to come back on anything Hugh? Do , do you, no? No, no, I mean No, right. I could come back and then Yes. can I say to Simon that Er, but is, are there any other questions before er er on the report that er Dermot and Vince has I think we ought to have a an adequate response Chairperson to the Yes, well just a minute! I want er, I'm just asking if er, anyone's got er, comments to make to Vince and then Vince will reply to them, that's the point, he's got to reply to some of the comments er, that er Simon has made and then we'll come to what we want our response to be. So as there's no other comments er, Vince would you have you got any? Yes Chairman, the figure of a hundred thousand as we said did, was erm a figure quoted on by account chief's executive of the purchasing consortium erm, that was spoken at a public meeting held here in Harlow last week erm the issue of the the transport around the area erm, was accepted by the the chief executive of the health authority erm or of that of the consortium erm, and the and the view that it would be much more difficult with the lack of public transport to get to the more relo , remote areas of Essex the the reason that the erm reduced use of London was put into this report was also erm, clearly stated by the chief executive,i it's their clear aim to provide more of, to purchase more of the services from within the north Essex area, and that was stated in a major part of the conta , of of their erm achievements and that automatically means a reduced amount of choice for those people who would otherwise for, to London. Erm it is er fair to say that London's far easier to get to er, from Harlow than certain areas in Essex are erm, those are direct comments from the chief executive of the proposed erm health authority. The financial position of the provider, this was erm well in the report because the consultation document that was it quotes a figure o of erm, in the amount of patient's treated erm, with the same amount of money. However, one has to bear in mind that at the last meeting of the West Essex Health Authority erm they are saying that they can't carry on treating the same amount of people erm, because they're overspend already this year and that they will not treat these er, extra contractual referrals without prior funding being approved and that was co , that was actually stated at the meeting last week. Erm, so that that was put in the meeting to show a balance, if you like, between, yes they've achieved an eight percent but over last two years the providal unit have run deficit and erm one interacts with the other and that was, that was also something that er that's Erm not true. The last thing I would say Chairer on the erm, what else can the authority do? Health authority meetings can't, they aren't very well publicised erm and in fact, sometimes we have go over and, and get our own agendas and er I would suggest that perhaps would it be possible for them to be much better publicised than they currently are? Yes. Thank you Vince. Now, er erm are there any members who want to add to er what's er, has been written in er this er response? I think that er Vince has has raised a point about er erm, informing er and consulting local people and to let local people know erm when the meetings are then local can't go, I'm sure that if they really wanted people to come they'd make it much more er, in erm with the advertising so clear that er people would be able to and also if they had it at the times when a their meeting at the times when it was mostly convenient to er, the general public. Hugh, do you want to comment? Yeah I was gonna move erm on a suggestion that we had not been convinced of the need for this consortium by er, so far and and that certainly we as an authority er, have remained opposed to it on the grounds that we've stated the terms of accountability in terms of the er, sensitivity to local needs in terms of transport issues and in terms of the clear intention to restrict patient choice erm which I think is a key think which should be emphasised Yes. the evidence that we've found out already from C H C is that the operation of the N H S reforms has restrictive patient choice because crucially those referrals to London teaching hospitals which used to made as a matter of course if treatment is unable er, unavailable in Harlow have actually been largely stopped, I got the detailed figures from the purchasing director erm er, recently in the C F C minutes and it shows a miniscule number of patients being referred to London teaching hospitals erm, and this is clearly the reason as this points out in this paper that London teaching hospitals are in serious financial problems and four of them, indeed are being threatened with closure by the Tomlinson report and I think many patients in Harlow would much rather as er, people have pointed out, go to er, Middlesex and U C H, should they still exist than to go to Colchester and er, but this is this a key question, so on the the basis of the this consortium doesn't meet those criticisms indeed,make the situation worse I move that we oppose it in principle that Vince reports on that line. So seconder for that? Seconded. Seconded, yes but Lorna? Erm ya, I mean I've already had what, I've had what I've had to say about the the the content of the thing I was merely going to ask where we go from here? I'm aware that our backs are up against the wall as regards time because the response is meant to be in by Friday erm I don't think actually that this is the the paper that Vince is presenting, although in fact, surely raises issues, I don't think it is actually response as it stands, I think it is a paper which raises items of issues for this committee to consider, I don't think in itself it serves as a response. Erm I wonder how substantially it's going to re-written, first, in order to make it a response rather than an issue raising paper and ah, secondly, in the light of what we've all had to say this evening and, if it is to be re-written I wonder erm who is going to actually see it and approve it before it goes off in time to get to the health authority by the day after tomorrow? Well that's er cos normally they a matter will be er that we going to fight er, easily er so I mean i , it meant that the er, that er er some more should be brought out so that it er does er adhere to what er these er er government departments er expect as a response rather than er er as this considered issue raising er, we can er facilitate that er quite er easily but er I think er the the main point is what Hugh has said, that er we opposed it because it's not going to help in my view it's not going to help er the patients, the patients are not going to come off any better as a result of er, these er er what I would say and I feel and er the, I I I'd like to know what er the GP's think about cos GP's usually erm er, advise their patients if they have to wait a long time from one hospital, they would advise them to go into London and er, if that's been stopped as been er that's been stated erm then erm, er the GP's are not going to feel very happy about their patients er, getting er erm a lesser service. So, the patients and our residents are our main er concern and er, if we all er, oppose it in principle and er, er er then er let us see how we'll erm er, revamp this er response. Alright? Jim? Yes Jim? considering, I mean, there is a closing date quite quick Mm. well may I propose that we put all this along of the lines with flexible that they expressed the committee tonight and use ? Exactly! We use Right, thanks. Er, I don't know if you er, meant er er er the various plans to achieve er,i in that order but I certainly want obey patient's choice er, er er a a at first that's the reasons I've found. Well yes, that will come out er . And and you mentioned GP's, I mean, this is one way of almost perhaps forcing some GP's to become er erm a fund holders, because then they can go an an an and buy their er er patient care from wherever they the they want to! But this er er er if they're not fund holders that they er er er and then it's a way out for er . Yes. Yes. Right, thanks er, Ann. Right, we agree with erm Agree. . Thank you very much. On the next er, item er, the er erm an elective member to represent the council on the purchasing strategy group ee er er you would I would like the move . Well, I was going to say we're take it to council alright? Alright. Yeah, okay. Erm, can I ? Yes. And I've kept . And now last week. erm on the next er, item er we have er on item ten we've got the welfare rights and er advice and we've got quite a long report which I hope you'll agree is an excellent report, er and er Sue is here to present it. Sue please? Page seventeen to ninety four. Erm because the report is er quite a long report mainly the er part of the report erm I will pick out the most important comments and if I could take the first part of the report first erm this concerns a new staffing structure between er, newly emerged welfare rights and advice service. Erm the council erm, the welfare and associate advi advice centres since nineteen seventeen eight however, until March of this year erm the staff the counter staff within the advice centre were divided into to two departments er, the information and community services department reported to committees and, as a result of the general move within the council and the service department to er neighbourhood erm offices and called the support services. We were asked to erm come up with a new structure erm, and and it, the purpose of this report and to put that . The I think the erm the main point that I'd like to make is that erm the structure as it's posed erm is for the same number of staff erm, however, the three, what were supervisory stroke managerial posts erm have changed, we feel, as a result of the merger and therefore, and there are three er little posts mainly, a head of, people called a head of and a head of the support, support a support services manager and a support services officer and erm the appendix details the main er, functions in each post, er those posts. But erm certainly they er if they are er, graded as we anticipate there will perhaps be a small saving, in fact, as a result of the merger. And I think they are graded slightly higher than the as , they they will come out at the same cost, same overall costs. And the new structure erm moves towards erm team working across the advice centre composes of three teams er and also, takes on the critical self managing team so that erm in terms of the this work and technical support that er, has in the past been offered by a team leader, er, team leader and advice centre manager that will be, in the future will be offered by a senior member of staff erm, for each other and for less experienced staff . The teams will er, in the service part, which is the second part of this report is, is who ? Erm the the service channel will be divided into the three teams and the teams will be expected to deliver erm an agreed level of service within the which ever is available . So chaired the first part of the report I recommend that the structure as outlined erm, be approved and that the necessary recruitment take place as soon as possible. Er, I understand that if that those recommendations are approved this evening that that will then go to erm council staffing erm, which is currently erm, decided the overall er, priorities intended . Okay, I don't know whether I repeatedly er, members of the council like to ask questions about the structure so they can ask, and I can move on, so The next, well I'll give them tha , er ja , er Jim, yes? Yeah,I I will take only part of this debate as my daughter works in . Alright Jim Okay. Er, Ann, yes? Now personally I understand that the benefit shop is o er er er will be moving to the advice dispensing of centre shortly. Er, what co-operation or a ar ar ar ar you,? The these could of been yeah, they were bringing er er an , I'm bringing it in because I Ann I'd rather you keep the reports if you don't Yes. mind! An and perhaps for that, I've never heard that one before! . Or or jumping up the council's face! The the the the the the of the Benefit Shop, I make people advice and several of us were set on, on on on er er that you handled recently er er er er i it was the . Am I allowed? Yes, you can. Yes, but er we're really dealing er with Yes. the advice centre and what has happened to with erm er, I've er, if you've read the reports you'll see that er, that had been working er under er er er a considerable amount of er er stress and strain. Erm there's been a reduction er, in the er, staff er because er er people have moved on and er, I take Sue's point about er if it weren't for the fact that erm they'd got fully e e experienced staff who've been there some time, they haven't, not used to this churning over o of, and therefore, that has paid off in er in er in erm so far as being able to deal with the problems that have arisen and er, you'll see further on er, addition profiles of the work that's been done with er in this area over the town . Er, the, so something must be done quickly, I fear, about the er, management er of er, er the, the new structure and I hope you would agree to it unless anyone else has got, yes? Er i i is Harry? council gonna erm pose it in the areas closer to it ? Well, er that's been, that's been outlined in er er,i in the er, the report! Yes, but I think . All, all I wanna ask really is that erm er, is the staff happy with it? I mean that's the main thing,i in that staff . As long as you that situation, I mean that's the main thing. Well that it means that we've got, there's going to be er, a certain amount of extra staff though required, that's what's in in the report. Well you can start by not depending on the structure er er the structure of which Susan's speaking Yes. Yeah. seems to me is a very sensible organise the system most effectively er whether there's any but that's not affecting the structure. bit And the the structure. I've just asked Sue, I'm sure you wrote this with the full support of your staff? Yes. Yes. Well I'll second what Peter said. What did you say again? Erm,structure. And very system Just a minute! structure is the the the er Sue wants to write it down what you've said are you moving that we Yes, that er, the recommendations that er , presumably our service approved which has got structure in it, does that er Yes. Bu but Chairer it's not a practised little structure it's a guaranteed performance and what's it committee. They do that with this recommendation. Sorry? The the It's not the practice, the questions of structure guarantee performance erm P and Q committee . Er, yes but er er, I under stand that this is going to Yes, you've said that I mean to er another panel isn't it? It's going to be erm In actual fact, Jim is right it's slightly complicated. Service plans come with relevant committees, being this one in this case but structures and structures strictly speaking, are still the remit of P and Q, so I think it might be a courtesy to let me have a look at the structure because they are simply right, guardians of the organisation P and Q Yes. As I think Shaun would phrase it. Yes. Erm but I think it would, really be a courtesy. Certainly the request of staff then could turn into of the panel erm but but I think at the same time if people want to look at the structure so that they have a complete view of the structural organisation Yes? That would be erm that would be a part of it. in Okay? We agree with that? Agree. Agreed! Nobody against that? No. Right! Thank you very much. So that er finishes er er, and erm the page. Now we go on to er housing er, issues. Er, and this is er Paul is it not? Yes, thanks Chairer. Yeah. The report on ! Oh sorry! Sorry! Sorry! There is the second part of the Oh! But I thought we erm just explained that? to service the service clan which, I don't think will be controversial but erm I did just seat for the first part of report, the little bit about . Yes. Did you want to, er well Well I thought that members had raised Yes, I thought, but then there's, but briefly er Sue, I was going to wanted to point out in fact er you just er if you don't mind Paul I'll just go back Mm. to Sue wanted to point out that er erm how well your staff had er worked on er that what they had done er er all over the town i in some instances er enabling people to get to their rights by you know, taking them to tribunals which is quite er time er er exercise. I, I certainly don't erm propose to go through the service requirements to approve it but I did say that to start with, I just wanted to clarify that all the policies have been by the people and Yes. that I don't . Yes. Yep! Moving straight up there Mm. Right. Thank you very much. Right er Paul, we're going over to Yeah, page ninety five, ninety Yes. six report on Field development. Erm members will remember at the last er, personal services committee on the twenty fourth of June er, the option to put forward by the Environment Trust and Widdings er, builders was accepted as the one that er officers could pursue and to actually get some final proposals worked up and bring back to both the neighbourhood committee and this committee. Erm at that erm meeting members did er bring up a number of points er, the comments and questions which have been put to the Environment Trust and the answers to them are there on page ninety five under progress to date and, and on onto page ninety six er, the main ones really are the question as to whether er, any rented housing could be provided erm, in the scheme is dealt with there the Environment Trust only develop for sale or for equity share er, they're not a housing association, they're a charitable body erm so they didn't feel that they were able to er, take on the role of er, provided rented housing in the scheme. Erm the other main point which was raised by planning if you remember, was that erm, they wanted officers to evaluate a two block scheme er, because they wanted er, good access to the land to the rear of Franklyns for er, perhaps some future development. When this was put to the Environment Trust erm they were er, unaware before that stage that there were erm may be proposals of developing that land and expressed an interest in being involved if that ever came to fruition. Erm now we have, as an authority to negotiate er, to put that land together erm the Scout's hut is on some of that land at the moment, and we've failed er, to do that in the past. Where, the environment trust, since our initial meeting have spoken er, both with Essex County Council and community groups in the area and have made substantial progress erm on the idea of er, using some of the land to the rear of er, the existing Franklyns block er, so they do want to come back with some wider proposals for a larger scheme which will be much the same as regards the Franklyns block but will include nine er, additional homes erm, and they will be two three bed houses and seven er, two bedroom houses. Erm it's it's quite an interesting erm er, addition to the er original proposal but clearly members will need to take a view as to whether er they want erm the Environment Trust to do that but erm, er what I would suggest is that we bring back er, some final proposals from Environment Trust at the next meeting er, for members to have a look at. The er, other recommendation really is just a member's note the outcome of discussion so far, it has been to the erm, we did take the paper to the Hare Street, Little Parndon er, committee er, in this cycle and there were no comments that came er, from that committee. Right. I don't remember maybe I've got a poor memory but er I can't remember you mentioning that the erm area committee but er there was erm going to be another block there and that er, the er this er trust, er Environment Trust had let one of the Northbrooks er and consulted with the Northbrook's people? Okay, at that point in time they hadn't actually er taken Ah! that consultation, they were waiting to meet with the county er Oh! to . Yeah. Er well erm I'll be very interested to know whether er, what sort of consultation with the Northbrook's er, people that they've had and erm when er, I recall asking about erm er, some of these er dwellings being for rent and erm I thought that , you said er i it was a possibility. But then you come and tell us well they're a charitable trust I would of thought that a charitable trust would of been very er, happy to have seen the some rented accommodation? So er but er, that's just maybe a bit Yeah. bit of a . Yes yeah, I, I'm also very disappointed that er er, in the negotiations that they didn't er er, come up with any sort of housing erm I think the, it's mucking any future negotiations with other partners or developers,speculators whoever they may be, I think it's important that we have, er we strike a balance between bu houses for sale and rented accommodation because, I mean they need to now the building er, this house for sale and each time we we we we knock down flats or building and ga gave the land free of charge to the speculators we have to de-count people, those people are moving th the existing te er people on the waiting list and they're getting moved further and further back and er I think i i i it's a very worrying situation where we are continually giving land free of charge and they're getting no rented accommodation. I mean well if I remember in Harlow er,we we i i in in nineteen seventy eight we had twenty thousand er, social er, council housing and about nine thousand owner occupiers the situation, that ratio's been reversed where we, where i by the end of the century we practically have about three thousand social social housing and about twenty two thousand er er, owner occupiers! Erm but er I hope you're not going to way that er Westminster Council has gone, for each er er er, er er th their property into disrepair they bought it up, do it up and flog it on the open market when a few yards away there are people no a er now sleeping under bridges and canals! Now I think that's disgusting! And er, we'll be a part, I know as councillors, Labour councillors we are caught in a trap because due the financial constraint that the government has placed upon us there is very little we could do but, oh I'll get I I er crumbs of comfort from the speculators who may decide to to give us a few social housing. I'm concerned for the people who are waiting for housing, I'm concerned about young people who are living in i i in ten er, on the tenth floor of high rise flats, these people have been waiting a very very long time and each time er, the er these they are, the properties are er, de-counted they are going further and further behind. So I think any future in and negotiations with the er,there has to be provision for social housing. Well I think that when yo , we're going to get a hundred percent nomination there . Yeah perhaps I could erm, reply to one or two of those points. Yes, as you pointed out we have been offered one hundred percent nomination rights to er, these equity share units the er, partners which members have shows as erm er the Environment Trust are a charitable trust, they're not they're developers, they're not speculative developers. Erm the point that they were at pains to make as well was that erm that because of the low cost nature of these homes erm the charge for a mortgage would actually be less than er, is is common in a charge for most association properties with similar sites erm in terms of rent. Erm members may also remember that er for the schemes that came forward on Franklyns were a result of a er, an advertisement being placed three of the schemes put forward erm, were for sale of equity share, one was put forward which came er, to the last meeting in this committee which was a rented scheme erm, but was for people for members took a view the erm the Environment Trust scheme er would prove a better option er, in Harlow. Chairperson. Yes erm Hugh, I want to ask you as erm the Chairer of the area er committee erm if you're happy with Yes I mean, I think that we had a big discussion at the last area committee on the scheme and the problem was of course that the detailed plans er, for the consultation erm to the, I'm at, I'm a bit worried that at this late stage there's this new idea of of building on the green wedge at the back and I wouldn't like to think that the scheme should be delayed the important thing, it seems to me, is that it should press ahead and and , and Northbrooks ever since it was built right next door to me when I was living there er, many years ago and er get the, the new development done, and so that I don't think we should hold on. Erm I'm rather sceptical about the notion of building on that green wedge at the back! It's does smack to me a bit of in-filling and er, Northbrooks is quite a dense area already, a ve , a very dense area erm, and erm I'm I'm, you know, I'd like to see any detailed plans on that before we even look at one in principle. I don't think we should hold up this one because of it, er so I would like to see the more detailed plans coming to the next meeting of the area committee er, so that residents can comment on this. Yeah, but isn't that going to be incorporated in as one package? Well I wasn't sure whether Paul was saying it's gonna be held up because of that? No, erm We no, I've I've had a meeting wi with colleagues around the table with the Environment Trust in the last couple of days and er Yeah. just that issue was raised that we would not want to see demolition of Franklyns that block held up by this. Mm. We would not want to see the scheme a held up or at least, the timetable that we could set down. Right. Erm the assurance from the Environment Trust is that i it need not happen erm, it may not hold things up Mm. erm providing they could get some planning applications at the next er, committee cycle. Mhm. erm, yes this is part of the planning process in any case the er the suggestion proposal all being . Yeah. Okay, thanks Paul. Yes, you wanted to say? It was the thing about er, my understanding is that people in the area and it's probably the most densified area in the whole of the town are very very cagey about this! I think in general term they will go along with the erm the de-furbishment or the destruction of the er but my understanding is they are reserving their judgement until they've seen some version of the plan. Mm. but er any attempt to put anything on at the back to the extent, right up to the Scout's hut in Beech Hall will, I think, generate a lot of feelings about Mm it in in, in the area. Something like, I think we've seen before, so er Mm. Yes. Right, so Yeah can I just Sorry? Oh Annabelle! wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa , thank you. Paul was saying that I mean, they're a hundred percent nomination housing the people who need the housing most are aren't the ones who who'll be able to er, to use the and there's no housing strategy on on er o o on the equity part,the the there might be, only a tiny bit, on on on the rent side but it doesn't homes fo for the people who really need it, even if they've got a hundred percent nomination flats! Okay, could I actually say something here? Erm, listening both to what Anna and Terry are saying here, I think er myself and and the colleagues in housing are very well aware that what this council doesn't have is a pre-developed strategy of social housing. Erm we've we've actually developed social housing really rather as it's been an opportunity we've grabbed it and we've done it, you know, some of it's been very very good an and nobody's knocking that but I think it is time that we took stock and actually had a a proper policy and a proper strategy on sa on social housing. Can I just say to you that that's already been developed and worked out we're intending in the next cycle to bring you proposals for a housing strategy, er on social housing, and within that we're intending to run a series of short seminars for members to give members, all members, not just members of this committee but members of all area committees until everybody has that information background information on things like, social housing, partnerships, housing association grant so that everybody's in a position to actually er, see and make a decision on what this council wants out of social housing, but all of that will take place in the next cycle Chair. Mm. So that I think the sort of questions that are being raised here will be addressed and will be able to be put within that complex, that overall strategy which I think now is sort of pretend, it doesn't exist at the moment. And I think it is important so that decisions like this can be made within a er, a framework that we've all, you know, been part of, and na are happy with agreed to. Though I think that that will be happening in the next cycle. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, that's very helpful. So could we get back to the recommendations. Agreed, the recommendations? Agreed. Thank you. Next er, item is er on er the consultation paper on the gypsy site policy and illegal camping. Thank you Chairer. Erm It's on page ninety nine. Yes, page ninety nine of this er, thank you Chairer. The er consultation and on the eighteen of August erm was circulated to many members on the fifth of the September, a thirteen page document erm, it was true to say that the er consultation paper contained some fairly radical proposals for changes in dealing with er gypsies and travellers. Give them ! Erm amongst other things erm ceasing the responsibility of local authorities to provide sites erm have the new powers to move er illegal or unauthorised erm on, from the land including er, season caravans in certain instances erm the curtailment by the government of er, grants for local authorities to provide and construct sites having spent fifty six million pounds erm doing just that since nineteen seventy eight according to the report. Er, various changes in planning proposals erm, and indeed erm encouraging travellers who are perhaps no long travellers, those who are resident on the sites to move progressively into government housing. Er, a particular concern at the time of writing the report was the position concerning the long outstanding proposals to develop to redevelop the two sites in Harlow erm to date we have no information from the county, er, there was scheduled to be erm, the meeting due to take place on the twenty second of September but the county er cancelled that meeting so it's impossible at this stage to give any further comment on that erm although I believe that matter's being taken up. Er comments are required in to the by the thirteenth of November er, and the Associations of District Councils have asked us to comment indeed by next week er, so member's views on the consultation paper are . Chairer? Well, er I've got quite a few comments but I'll ask first, Bill? The Yes, but On the last comment that er Chris made er bringing us and the letter to county about the the failure of the meeting on the twenty second cos we feel that they are just lying down to the situation and not pursuing a pursuing the D A P about whatsoever and erm we are, certainly in John's letter probably get it signed tonight complaining and asking for a a meeting as soon as possible because we feel that that they ought to be pursuing the question of these two sites, they're dragging their feet! On the question of the government's proposals I'm entirely opposed to the er the idea that they should wash their hands of their er, obligations er, the nineteen sixty eight act as as a number of members know er, gave it as they are the duty of a local authority to acquire some sites for gypsies some local authorities er, obeyed that and er they actually provide the sites, like Harlow, other authorities just ignored it! Completely ignored it! So if they, if they removed the local authorities judging we'll be in a terrible position! An absolutely diabolical situation because then the the the local authorities that have continued to avoid doing what they ought to have done will be rubbing their hands with glee while the others who have a a social conscience, a moral social conscience will be put under tremendous pressure! So, we must oppose that and er also they're asking for new powers er to move illegal travellers from land this is just another device because of their failure to provide sufficient sites throughout the country and if the of Essex County Council do their job er they they don't need these new powers, what authority ought to be ha , er having are powers to provide some er, camping places for people. And er the question of the grants as well, I'm opposed to the fact that they they're going to if we don't hurry up er, these two sites in Harlow will not, never be completed! If they stop the altogether we have to act very quickly. So I'm against all their proposals, I think they're an absolute disaster! Chairer? Thank you Bill. Er Could I just ask a question? Yes. Could you tell er could I mean, have you got any information about the grant here? Er, because er our submission for a grant regarding these two sites were submitted prior to all this coming forth Yes. so therefore, it must be granted. Now, will,tha I had hoped that we'd have an information that we'd have information at this meeting, it's the thirtieth now! Mm. Right? And I had hoped we'd get the information, have we got any information on that? Well, it's a hundred percent grant that the D of E gives to er the er county council, so then it's really it's transferred to us isn't it? Except the payment of er, the erm th the manager of the sites or the warden of the sites. But Chairer I have spoken to officers at county in the last few days to Mm. try and get some information on this they felt that they were confident that at the end of the day that erm, approval would be given but erm I I I asked for it in writing and they said we wouldn't be getting that. Oh! Well We would be getting it? Ah we wouldn't, you wouldn't. We wouldn't be getting it. Well I ca , I'll ask a question then so that will have to be answered. But, in reply to er Terry when yes, of course, we should get it if it was prior to their new act er but er the there's no morality with this government I'm afraid Terry, as you and I well know! Lorna? Right, thanks Chairer. I've already put in our comments in writing on this to to Chris and I'll just sort of draw some of them save me repeating them. Erm certainly, as a group we we welcome the fact that there is a provision for travellers in Harlow on the two permanent sites and we also welcome the upgrading er, of the to to happen, although I very much hope it doesn't . Erm I'll go through the consultation paper and pick out sort of paragraph by paragraph and any that we particular agree or disagree with. Er, certainly in, in the first paragraph we would say that we have drawn attention over the years to the nuisance of illegal parking erm, by travellers particularly in Stewards erm while travellers have the right to live their own lifestyle we also believe that other residents have the right to live free from that kind of nuisance and problem and that it does need to be addressed somehow. However, this definitely isn't the way to do it! Erm we will continue to say that Harlow should have applied for designation years ago erm it's very Sorry can you repeat that? Harlow should of applied for a designation a long time ago if Harlow had been designated then surrounding councils would have had to live up their responsibilities to provide adequate sites for travellers which they have not done and successive governments have also failed to apply the caravan sites act nineteen sixty eight adequately. If they'd done so, if they'd insisted that local authorities did provide the sites they are supposed to provide I believe there would now be sufficient pitches for all travellers and that they wouldn't be used for illegal parking erm at the level that there is at the moment. Er, on paragraph nine the government's own figures show that there is a shortfall of glee while the others who have a a social conscience, a and that they've mixed, the site provision isn't keeping pace with the growth of the number of caravans and yet, what it's proposing to do in this paper will make the situation worse by removing any incentive erm and any requirement on local authorities actually to provide the sites that are needed to make up that shortfall and it's quite clear that what this is about is actually what it is happening in housing in general and that is shifting provision from the pri , from the public to the private sector. Erm there's also a very strange statement in paragraph which says that the nineteen sixty eight act is intended to provide a network of sites to enable gypsies to move around or settle, but in practice many gypsies are settled on permanent sites and it seems to me that that is the logical result of having insufficient pitches in that if th you know there aren't enough pitches for you, you are not going to get up and go from a permanent that you've been living on and move off in case you can't one somewhere else and that seems to be the inevitable logic of the government's own failure to make sure that there is adequate provisions in local sites. Erm the caravan sites act nineteen sixty eight er, paragraph fifteen did actually, I think address the provision government sites quite well, or it would have if it had actually been properly implemented in that there was a carrot and stick, there was stick or requirement for a site and the carrot is actually being able to apply to designation whether you lived up to that. Now it seems that successive governments have just haven't lived up to their obligation to wield the stick, and Harlow council just haven't had the sense to reach for the carrot in that that local people are caught in the middle! Erm on paragraph twenty erm the government's proposals will penalise all the camping which takes place outside recognised sites while at the same time I've already said, removing any incentive or obligation for local authorities to provide enough sites anyway so i it's, it's a a total squeeze that on the one hand the government is restricting the number of pitches and then penalising everybody who hasn't got one! Erm paragraph twenty one, we'd certainly oppose any move to give local authorities the right to cease homes of travellers erm especially in view of the shortage of the good pitches I that is just totally and I don't think that that's on, I hope we can oppose that. Erm I don't think the on paragraph twenty three and consequently the suggestion that that kind of permission really are realistic at all, erm I think this government is totally obsessed with owner occupation at the expense of all kinds of housing, whether it's permanent, rented or or anything else! Erm and this seems to be the whole kind of class of which the government is coming to this this document. I British commercial law is amongst the most expensive in the world. With new firms in the North of England under cutting their city rivals, is the writing on the wall for one of London's most traditional professions. Behind the city calm a battle is raging. A business worth three billion pounds a year is at stake. The attack is being spear headed from his new London offices by lawyer Paul . There will be firms who are practising today who will probably figure in the er top one hundred in the city who in my opinion will not be practising in that shape or form three years from now. I think they've got their cost structures er a a little bit out of line and I have to be honest that I think that some of them have thought that er all you have to do is, you know, keep a brass plate outside your door for fifty years and the work would roll in. Paul is a managing partner of a controversial firm of Yorkshire lawyers,. Champagne has long been used by the city institutions to woo clients. It's now become the weapon of the invaders from the North to sell law. Since moving in to the heart of the city last year,has become the talk of the legal world. Paul is a lawyer other lawyers love to hate, but his is only one of a number of Yorkshire law firms that are sending a chill down the back of the London legal establishment. They may scoff and call them Yob and co, but the revolution that these firms have brought to the legal market is probably here to stay. The city law firms all clustered within the boundaries of the square mile have dominated the market in legal services. Like other city institutions they grew fat on the back of the eighties boom. Even when the recession hit there was money to be made from liquidations and restructurings. is Britain's largest law firm and occupies a plush new building in the city. We have er one thousand two hundred lawyers in our firm round the world er continuing to develop their skills, continuing to deal with clients on a daily basis to make sure they're able to service those those demands. , with two hundred and thirty partners, turned over two hundred million pounds last year. The profits averaged out at a quarter of a million pounds per partner. A recent survey showed the big London firms to be the most expensive in the world. They can charge over three hundred pounds an hour for a partner's services, but that's increasingly subject to negotiation. Clients are not naive, they understand the job that needs to be done. They understand the price that is the market price to be paid for that. It's at the end of the day what you do for them. How you do it and whether you provide real value for money that is the important thing. This week's London motor show. General motors is promoting it's latest models in face of falling demand in European markets. The recession has made it take a hard look at the cost of law and at the attitude of big London firms that it's used for more than fifty years. Keith heads its U K legal department. They maybe haven't listened to their clients enough, particularly their industrial and commercial clients over the years. I think there was a there tended to be a feeling that value for money was not a a a requirement along with quality. Why? I think it relates perhaps to the fact that er the city institutions and the city law firms er concentrated on quality and competitiveness, value for money, cost saving wasn't necessary a part of the issue. And for many of Britain's best known companies the cost of law has become an issue in a way it never was before. Many years ago you didn't query the fees erm and er that's no longer the case. Why don't you query the fees? Well in in th the year that I was brought up in there was a a much more er er traditional fee structure which simply wasn't negotiated in the same way as it is today. Until recently there wasn't anywhere else increasingly cost- conscious industrial firms could go. That was before the rise of the Yorkshire lawyer. Costs in the north are much lower and local lawyers have bred a hard nosed approach to business. One of the country's fastest growing law firms is . Leeds has has grown as a financial centre over the last four or five years, probably more than any other city outside London. The law firms within it have been competing very strongly with each other, there are six extremely good law firms in Leeds and their I think that that experience in competition over the last few years will stand them in very good stead. Yeah it wasn't bad at all. You came came up by train? Yeah Today the firm's rehearsing a presentation to a major public company which is conducting a beauty parade. It's becoming the fashion among big clients to make lawyers pitch for their custom. We've er handled nearly ten percent of all U K floats in nineteen ninety three. Some of those have been very substantial, companies coming to the market with er market capitalizations in excess of a hundred million pounds. It's the beauty parade that's allowed regional firms access to what had been exclusively London business. Certainly if we're beauty parading against er maybe London firms where perhaps the attitude might be a little bit more than it is from the provincial firms that perhaps are used to having closer relationships with their clients. And before beauty parades, presumably a lot of these clients you wouldn't even get to meet would you? Erm no it'd be very difficult to get an opportunity to do so. It was through holding a beauty parade that I C I discovered the benefits of using a regional firm. The company decided to put all it's litigation work, worth over a million pounds a year, out to tender. It started with a list of city firms, but it soon realized there were other options. There were only three er criteria when we set out to choose a firm. Er expertise was the first and foremost requirement. Cost effectiveness was the second, and willingness to take some of our staff was the third. er met all those criteria and they had one additional benefit, their Leeds' base er means that er their centre er their own centre of gravity is very near where I C I's centre of gravity is, up in the north of England. The northern lawyers haven't been slow to see the marketing potential of providing legal services close to home. This year has done six major floatations of northern companies. The biggest was valued at over one hundred and fifty million pounds. If you go back seven or eight years ago er the city institutions would be saying to the companies, you know this is a er a major matter in the in the growth of the company and you need you need city representation, you need a firm of city lawyers to deal with it. Erm nowadays that's not the case and erm all the institutions know that there are some damn good firms out in the provinces who can who can provide the service. But here in London's legal citadel, until recently, has been played down. The strength of the largest city firms stems from the international business that flows through the capital. is Britain's fifth largest legal business. It's certainly true that er the big regional firms now do a lot of corporate work. But we don't find, if you like at the top end of the corporate finance market, that they are yet as significant a competitor as are er rivals among the leading firms. But do do the city firms think that they will become tough competitors in that market? It depends really what happens to them I think. I think they've built They've opened London offices, many of them, if those offices grow so they acquire the sort of breadth and depth of experience in the relevant areas that the big firms have got and at the moment er they may not have, then of course they'll be more and more competitive. Because so much of the commercial law trade go through London,have opened up a second front in the capital. Determined to break up what it sees as a cosy cartel, it has already spent over a million pounds on marketing and corporate entertainment. Today's party is to celebrate the floatation of a Mercedes dealership, the client is more than happy with his choice of lawyer. I know that it was erm very much more cost effective er than we would have got er for similar services from a traditional firm in the city of London. What sort of saving do you think you've made? probably about a third overall, with all the various aspects of the transaction in terms of all the legal costs. And has another trick up it's sleeve. It's been actively recruiting partners out of London law firms, along with their clients. One firm to experience poaching is a second tier London firm,. It's lost two senior partners to Yorkshire firms in little over a year. They I think are strengthening or er strengthening their position in the market in London by erm er a very sensible strategy of looking for er able people with client following. No doubt its an attack but other firms are doing the same. They want to take your clients and see you off the map? Well I don't think its quite er the level of aggression is quite up to that, I'm sure that the market for legal services is now very much more competitive which is a healthy thing, and er if er if we were simply sitting on our hands from the nineteen eighties and not bothering to respond to that kind of challenge then I would be worried about it, but we're not. For all that there's no denying the distaste felt by many London lawyers for tactics. They've been seen as too aggressive and too greedy. Aggressive? In what sense? Aggressive in terms that we fight in the market place for for clients and that we er then if that's what aggressive means the answer to that is yes. Er in terms of greedy, greedy in what? In that we manage to take good lawyers from other people? That's not greedy, that's just sound business sense. The city revolution is far from over. This week hopes to emerge with a large Birmingham law firm to strengthen its hand further. The game plan is to grow big enough to threaten even the city giants. With other regional firms joining in the battle for city work, even the biggest London firms have had to cut their fees and shake up their ideas. That in itself could be a lasting monument to the Yorkshire Terrier. the afternoon's business as printed in the programme and I call Neil to give his national officer's report. Neil . Colleagues, settle down please. President, congress Neil , national office speaking to the general secretary's report pages one two five, one four three. Congress it has been my sad misfortune to encounter some of the most hostile employers over the past year that would make the grey hairs that I've got fall out. But, having said that, we have tried in the Ministry of Defence where market testing has been the order of the day to say that it's confusing, that would be being polite, Mr Chairman. There is utter and total confusion and anything that stands still they used to say they would paint it in industry they now say market test it and they do admit to us that the end object does not necessarily mean complete contractorization or privatization, but at this particular moment in time we have found that the opposite has been the situation.

Hello I'm fine thank you. What are you on here for? Because er because I was invited on to speak about current educational issues Oh that's good I couldn't you see it's very difficult for me you know I have to look up there I can never distinguish one one one call from another. Right. Do you have a tit do you want me to your a title do you have er? I'm Press Officer for North Yorkshire National Union of Teachers. Yeah. Yo you're very lucky actually Noel that this is not erm a quiz show. Shall I tell you for why? Why? I'll tell you why cos the B B C there's a directive just gone out I've just been informed the B B C for quiz show hosts on the B B C to treat their guests with a little more civility. Can you believe it? How much more flipping civil can you get. Have you heard these quiz sho I mean they're all on radio four aren't they? All the quiz show yeah basically ? Well rad radio one as well. Mm Where do you live anyway? In Leeds. Oh good. Mm it's freezing outside isn't. It certainly is yes. What are we talk oh education we're talking about education right yep. Okay let me do the prog right er Noel that's a funny name Noel by the way isn't it? It's erm appropriate for the time of the year nearly . Mm It's like pulse but not. Oh oh er yes. Is that how you pronounce it? Erm it it is pronounce to Not the Noel y yeah okay. Anyway right so erm head teachers in the area have been complaining their schools are not tidy not cleaned sufficiently. Yes. Why? I mean why why are our children going to school in in pig sties? Well I think it's er down to the competitive tendering process where the County Council has had to put out the cleaning contracts for schools to tender. There were problems a few years ago when it first started with th the initial contract which was was won by the the County's own direct service organization and now it seems we're having a repeat of of those problems. Er with the new contracts that started in September erm basically it seems that some teachers are having to do bits of cleaning themselves to keep their their classroom up to up to scratch up to the standards they ought they ought to be. Erm we're hearing reports that parts of schools having to to be closed or th threatened to be closed because they're not sufficiently hygienic for pupils or teachers to work in. Oh how disgusting. And er That is isn't that disgusting? It certainly is yes . That is disgusting yes. So all these a lot of these firms are not up to the job why do why don't you sack them people are not up to the job why don't they get sacked? Well there are monitoring systems which are meant to be in place a and which may be er are not are not effective enough erm. I mean I've heard representatives for County Council th this week saying that er as far as they were concerned th the standards weren't sufficiently low yet for them t to take action. But basically th every time the contract comes up for renewal, what will happen for a company to attempt to win the contract it's got to cut the hours of its employees and its also got to try and c cut the costs erm by cutting pay and that's the way that's the way contracts are won in this situation and as long as that keeps happening then the situation's going to get steadily worse. What are we going I mean we we've heard also I'm changing the subject now because that was the the sort of political answer I'd expect and er I suppose until I get somebody else come on and say he's talking absolute whatever er I mean I think it is down to the people who live and work with the school. I think if you all make a mess you should be severely reprimanded quite frankly expect other people to come round and pick up your mess. Well that's something that a as a teacher we're erm in my school we're constantly saying t to the pupils I mean if they ha they have a they have a certain responsibility t to tidy up after them and t to try and keep their work area tidy that's not the same as er as cleaning at the end of the day as sweeping up all all the dust and and so on. What about this mum's army of teachers is this going to come to fruition as some point or not? I don't I don't believe it is erm at the mo well earlier this week a report was published by the National Commission on Education which was er an independent erm Commission that was set up erm and they they've said that basically what we need to be doing is t if we're trying to raise standards is to keep the idea of having an all graduate profess profession followed up by high quality for train training for teachers once they've actually started work. The problem there is that graduates are so terribly boring and uninteresting people basically aren't they that they find it difficult to impart their er You would? I would yes. You're a graduate. I am yes. Yeah I thought so anyway. Er I would have thought that graduates find it more difficult to impart knowledge to people than anybody else. No I'd I'd I don't I don't believe that that's the case erm Karen come to the studio please. Karen come to the studio please. Karen co sorry I just want to do something go on. Yeah so okay I'm I'm I'm I don't think that's the case. I'm I'm winding you up a little bit but no I mean there's a little method in this . When are the teachers going to stop being political animals and get down to teaching rather than try to score points off the Government? Oh we're Cos anybody can score points off them I mean it's simple. We we well we'd love to be able to get get on with our job and er wi with far less interference than we receive at the moment but er when government insists on er on interfering to the extent it does an and there have been well I've been reading recently so something like five hundred new powers the Education Secretary has given himself in the in over the last last few years. Well he's not going to be there for ever. Decisions are made decisions are made erm there that we and we have to live with the consequences of them. If they affect education then it's our responsibility to speak up about them. You see I I think er er probably one of the best erm Ministers of er of er Education that er has been for quite some considerable time and I bet you throw your hands up in horror when I say this you will totally disagree and I'm talking here cos his name's just slipped out of my mind . Who was tha who was that oh for goodness sake tall thin gaunt looking man, always had to have about fifteen spoonfuls of sugar in his coffee whenever I met him? S Sir Keith Joseph? Er you knew you see Sir Keith Joseph. Now I I remember talking to him for hours once on a programme about education and this was when he first said what we want is teachers to be accountable. And I'm a great believer in everybody should be accountable right? Yes. We well I've no objections to that to that at all. No none of you do now but when he first suggested it everyone was up in arms and he poor old soul I remembered he said, I've had enough change I I believe in this I I've I've tried I'm too old now and out he walked. Is there a chocolate machine in the building? And off he went. He was addicted to chocolate. I I I think erm a lot of teachers would now look back on those days with er a certain fondness now bearing in mind what's what's happened since and the the the succession of education secretaries we've had since since then I mean had the only one in recent years who I would say has attempted a genuine dialogue with the teachers and tried to do something constructive is John McGregor. So when, and I would agree with you again, so when are the teachers going to be accountable, when is somebody who is a bad teacher and heck there are quite a few of them, you know it only takes a couple in every school to make it difficult for the rest, going to be got rid of you know you are not up to the mark out. There there are systems in place in schools already for that and there always have been. You jest with me now come on we're we're we're being serious Noel if you are a teacher it is almost impossible to sack you. Almost totally impossible. That's simply not true. There there are disciplinary procedures in in all schools erm which are there to be used. Why are they never used then? Are all teachers too good to be sacked because it is it is as rare as erm teeth in chickens. I think it's I think it's very easy to er to ex exaggerate the problem to take one anecdotal evidence of of one about one or two cases and maybe about one or two people and say this is a major problem in every school. Let me put it this way to you Noel I don't think it is. Let me put it to you this way you know as well as I do people who really ought to be doing something else other than teaching. You know that as well as I do and those people don't seem to be given the encouragement to move on to another profession. I I Some are some are promoted to head teachers I know and I knew you were going to say that. I wasn't going to say that no . Erm no I I honestly don't think that er that the the problem is as big as as big as you you say it is and I I think the the structures are there to deal with that and if if people had you know if people used them then they would they would work and they from time to time that they are used and you know it it is not impossible to get rid of rid of a teacher in in the way you are suggesting. Okay Noel thank you for your er your time and being a good sport this afternoon and I hear you have a little one you had better go back and sort things out. That's right. Okay. Okay thanks. Thanks a lot Noel bye bye. Noel from the er N U T. Erm I don't know what this is serious point actually if if you fancy yourself as one of these so called mums and I think it is a little patronizing the er title of a mums' army of teachers, if you think that maybe you could do that and you'd be interested in doing that and you think it's quite a good idea I'd be interested in hearing from you, all right? O nine O four serious talk O nine O four six four one six four one erm if you'd like to do that give me a call. Now where is er where is Rita where are you Rit all right my love all right where's Rita I've got I've got yellow I've got red I've got blue I've got green. What number is Rita on give me a number because I haven't got white? Twenty four Okay right if I put that down there Rita hi. Hi. How are you? I'm fine thanks . Hang on let me do that again that's good that isn't it? Makes a little noise click click click click. Can I have a chip does anybody hi Rita Hi. Lovely Rita meter Oh don't please. I hate that isn't it awful to be obvious. Well that's what everybody sings to me when them and they meet me for the first time or get introduced to me. Oh they don't. Where are you calling from we're very loud with callers today I know I'm not the most exciting thing on radio but you know there must be some callers out there somewhere? Where am I. I'm at a little place called Ellenthorpe. Ellenthorpe. Is the weather as bad as people keep telling me because it was Okay when I drove in this morning. No it's not it's it's quite mild, there's no frost on the ground it's all gone. So what's this about snow at Thirsk? Well they can keep it we don't want it. Bit strange in Thirsk anyway I thought. I think there'd probably somebody with expanded polystyrene ceiling that's been pulled out. Probably. Yeah it's it's actually it's not too bad it's a bit misty it's a bid hazy erm slight wind but it's not bad. It's not? No it's not bad No Okay. I've just got to get something do you mind? No go and get your chips or whatever. No I've got I've got I wanted t It's all right my hubby can wait for his lunch I aren't bothered. Jolly well ought to as well. Er I wanted to talk to Jim Bowen you see about this quiz show host ought to be a a little nicer than they are and apparently his answer machine is on at home. Well I must admit James I've threatened to put mine on. Have you? Well Karen said that if I won the competition she'd ring back. Mm and then you thought, Oh God I've done it now . But I had to speak to you you see and I dialled you while you actually said on the air that anyone that won had to speak to you and said to Karen look if you ring back I'll put the answer phone on . I know I thought that was good because then everybody puts the phone down you see and they all think they're going to be terribly clever. Yes I think it depends on what kind of a message you actually have on your recorder to start off with. Is your's rude. No it just says that it's basically to the effect of that the answering machine is quite reliable I I and if you leave a message it will be dealt with and people do leave a message, whereas before when it just said I'm sorry I'm not available they didn't they just put the phone down. I usually leave a message saying I'm having sex at the moment ring back in about three seconds. And do they? Sometimes sometimes they never ring back at all ever. I should've just say you're bragging. Yes you're right, you been speaking to my wife? Well yeah we'll probably use the same supermarket I don't know. So listen I wan er er so is there any snow out there at all anywhere? No no hon There's not. Any chips out there ? Well to be honest Ja I can't see that far normally from where I live I can see the White Horse bank but it's shrouded in mist at the moment erm no I can't see so I couldn't tell you whether there there is snow up there or not. Okay. I also I I also erm er what was I going to say I would take the disc but I can't find a way of getting into this machine actually it's broken erm . It sounds about par for the B B C. Young Danny, the big boss now weekend said er take a disc take a disc and I said yeah well it's knackered er erm. What? Sorry. I'm doing that talking to you look for Jim Bowen's mobile phone number so I thought we'd give him a ring that'll surprise him wont it? Yeah. Okay er Can the B B C afford these phone calls? I don't think so no I don't think so at all that's why they don't call anybody back. Oh well you can call me back. Erm oh hang on just a minute can you hang on there? Yeah Well hubby's waiting I'll I'll get to you in a minute. for his lunch but it doesn't really matter. No stuff that who cares? Er hungry. He well so am I. Actually I was hoping someone's going to bring in some er some some Nouveau Beaujolais Nouveau cos a new one came out on Thursday. Is there nobody round here listening that can erm that could bring in some Beaujolais Nouv no no little Off Licence that will do this free publicity on the B B C to come in a say, Look I'm an odd bin or something like that ? I I thought the B B C I thought the B B C couldn't advertise then? No the B B C can't. But you can? Well. You're the exception to the rule I suppose? Yes you wait till you get severely beaten and then you say I'm very sorry I didn't mean to do that. Hang on hang on I've got Rachael from er from Guide Friday Buses. Oh golly hang on just a minute . I think I think I think you've probably stirred a hornets nest up with that. Hang on just a minute. Er Rachael? Rachael? Hello. Is that you Rachael? Yes it is. God I've I've been in love with you ever since I met you all those where are you at the moment? I'm actually in the office in Tower Street over looking Are you? Clifford's Tower. Why don't you wonder over here? There isn't actually a bus in oh yes there is a bus in sight. Why don't you wonder over here and bring a bottle of wine and we'll share it over the next hour of the show. Oh I can't I've got things to do in the office, a busy company here. I never did like those open topped buses. Well unclear So I'll be back to you. at the moment I can see about half well a dozen people sat on one of the buses. Can you? Yes. No wonder there's no traffic moving out there today. There is traffic moving, it's moving quite freely apart from the cars going into the car park just behind Clifford's Tower. Is that right? That's right yeah. There's never any spaces behind Clifford's Tower so I don't know how you're just telling me fibs aren't you? Well they're all they're all queuing up to go in there so I not sure. I just don't understand all these buses with the open tops it's freezing out there and all these tourists look they could walk Rachael. Well are tourists They could walk, why don't they walk? It's a seven kilometre tour. It takes an hour and a lot of people don't want to walk around the city they'd like the option of going around on the bus. What did the Minister of Health say the other day? Obesity obesity and lack of exercise. and that's what you're encouraging Rachael . Not encouraging lack of exercise we're encouraging an informative tour around the city with a qualified guide. You still got that beautiful blonde hair? We're not on the air are we? No no no we're not on the air. Heaven forbid I wouldn't talk to you like this if we were on the air would I ? Anyway so go on. Right. What were we talking about? So you don't mind Talking about the buses. Yeah. So I mean I think it'd great Guide Friday you run around little flag in the air, I've seen them in London and you can do that and and and people get so fit. Not that you need to be any fitter than you are. Well they are fit cos they get on and off at any of the stops they go along to the attraction that they want to do. Yeah I walk from my front door to my car as well and people say that's not enough exercise. Well the a there's the Barbican Centre for the exercise perhaps they should encourage the tourists there then. Mm Forgetting all about oh dear I've got a frog when I go on the air I'll clear that. Er can you hang on a minute? Yes certainly. I just got a we commercial breaks call you back in a minute don't go away yet. Rita? Rita? Oi Rita where's Rita gone. You cut her off well get her back on. Get her back on or she's not having this I'm sorry about that hang on just a minute block your ears I'm just going to spin round again okay hang on oops er are you their Rachael are you there? I'm here yes. Oh you are okay fine good got you. I can't open me thing here. the the er music blowing machine. There's a problem hang on. are you do you ever go in for karaoke and stuff stuff like that? No I don't. Yeah all right never mind about the photo give me your teddy I don't care about that.

Do you get fed up with people saying, Are you really like that one in Coronation Street? No I don't actually cos I'm nothing like her . Erm You look similar. Well that's er that's a insult. It's not. It is. Yeah. I thought when we did we did that programme out to lunch in the summer and you came along and we talked all about buses and er your organization and I I I was very nice to you actually. You were very pleasant. And didn't say you know, It's flipping these tour buses in York that cos all the other people trouble because you can't get anywhere they clog the roads up. Well that's really not our problem I mean that's to do with the deregularization of er bus companies allowing any anybody to start up a bus company. Oh that's a bit political Rachael isn't it a bit political I wasn't expecting that featured the last er three years some of the other companies have only been here since last year and the year before so I mean we're a national tour operator experienced in running open topped tours around cities. Could you hang on just a minute don't go away just stay there hold on. Ah Rita. Yes James. Good. Sorry about that Still here. What? I said I'm still here.

So there's no chance of getting rid of all these coaches and getting people to walk round the er the guided tours and stuff like that? Er well that would defeat the whole object of offering the open topped tours if people were actually walking. Well it would defeat you making a few bob . There is actually there is actually walking tours around the city for those people who wish to opt for Mm. for a walking tour. So there is the option of doing both the walking tour or the bus tour.

Yeah okay I'll go and put the thing so I could be with you in a minute. Okay er right it's one twenty seven B B C Radio York the station that's first for travel. Oh hang on a minute er don't don't go just yet don't go just yet all right? I'll just I wasn't first for travel. Okay on the er A one area that's the er Bedale area, the earlier north bound lane closures have been lifted and the Leeming area the inside lane of the southbound carriageway's closed at Holby Grange for emergency gas repair works and delays are likely as a result. In York, travel near the butch very butch Knavesmire could be slow due to an event taking place and York City are playing Barnet at Bootham Crescent today so traffic will be fairly busy around that area. In Selby a demonstration is taking place this afternoon, it starts at one thirty and will go via Barlby Road and Scott Road and some traffic delays are likely. And finally in the Ripon area weekend roadworks mean the Road will be closed as it passes under the A one bridge and delays are likely. Gary Shaw A A Roadwatch. Do it again I like the bit do your name check at the end go on. Are you sure? Yeah go on. Gary Shaw A A Roadwatch. Yeah. Okay What on earth does that mean? Looking at the railways I wouldn't go anywhere near the station though I might oh hang on I mean what does that all mean? Isn't this better for tra wouldn't you take more wouldn't you take more notice of the traffic and travel if it was like this every time ? Okay er the thirteen twenty five erm when it looks like they all went early . It's the thirteen twenty five to Manchester Victoria left at thirteen O five. I need somebody to come in here and explain this. I think it is broken because it says also er Manchester to er I know it's expensive on British Rail but it says one thousand three hundred and five pounds up there. I'd phone the railway station if I were you I would phone it okay. That's okay that's traffic and travel's all right everything's snowing out there. Ah right John hello. John? Oh hang on you're not on there. You're on er red which is what number was football surely? Leicester City get the throw-in. Jochim won it Greyson not a very good ball Gemmell wins it back for Forest now Black forward Collimore's offside and that looked a very close decision. Ooh I'd like to look at that one again Alan . I mean that's bang in front of us and that's that's the sort of area they'll be looking to play the ball down the sides for Collimore's pace and I wouldn't wonder on it. I would wonder I made him, well it doesn't clearly show it there, I made him onside from our position. Meanwhile Agnew lifts it in and there is another offside decision and this time it's gone in Forest's favour. Speedy was offside. I think Stan Collimore's just said to the ref to the linesman on this side you know I started my run from m my half of the field but that would be a dangerous game to play against somebody with his pace is to give him too much space at the back of him. Oh that's a lovely header on as well it almost reached Rozario Greyson gets it clear. Chettle back into the Leicester half now Thomson and Agnew combining well and the first time Ball volleyed out towards Ormanroyd. Needs some help and gets it from Thomson who started this move off and lifted in towards Agnew, Cooper clears it still hasn't gone out and er Phillips just prevented it I think going for a corner, yes it's a throw. Thomson again for Leicester City looking very influential early on here. This is Lewis only nineteen this lad and very pacey and wins the corner. Yes you're spot there Alan erm Stevie Thomson is pulling all the strings for Leicester. I'm a little bit surprised Stone hasn't tried to get a bit closer to him although I think he's been given the job of tracking Agnew who's more of an attacking midfield player. Thomson takes the corner as well. Whitlow coming in on that near post the goalkeeper was very decisive then and er has benefited by getting the free kick Tommy Wright. Yeah that might be of those situations with the referee being over protective towards the goalkeeper. I don't really think he had a claim on that ball the goalie. I mean he's come out over the top of his own defenders and i over big Ormanroyd and he can do little else but push it back down into the pack. Couldn't really see how there was a foul there. Another free kick has been given this time against big Mike Whitlow Lively start to the game and a lively start for the referee. Eleven free kicks for fouls already. Gemmell swings the latest free kick into the box Pearce did well to win that one. Hill only half clear and that's a goal kick. But I think we're seeing something in the Forest side we haven't see for what twelve fourteen years are we. They just they th they refu you know they lift balls into the box now. I mean we've always associated Forest with playing their way into the penalty area now with Rozario er with Collimore they've got the licence or the facility just to knock long balls through the air at them. This is Kingsley Black and again he looks to use Collimore's pace and he moved into a great position there Collimore. Whitlow across to block he still gets the cross in that was dangerous. Agnew and Hill combining to get is clear but it's a corner and that cross caused real problems to Leicester. There's no danger if Leicester don't seal off this space. Here's that ball again up alongside. Defenders gone deep and kept Collimore on side and this is where you expect Stan to do his trick. Actually he's tried to play it in early there. Collimore will remain a threat from the corner he has just won. Rozario on the near post Chettle also has come forward for this kick and it goes in towards that near post area where Oldfield takes no chances. Second successive corner then for Forest and again it's aimed at Rozario who wins it this time that's dangerous. Scrambled away by Hill to Jochim. Lovely little turn he's deceived Cooper he's got the pace to go all the way here Jochim. How does the referee interpret that foul? Moore's the guilty player Jochim had got away from him and unless the referee decides that there was another defender coming round on the cover there Moores could be in big trouble. I think you'll find Cooper was just a touch deeper than him albeit very wide. I think Colin Cooper just got round the side of this a brilliant run from Young good turn and he's a he's attacked the heart of the defence and look at Cooper's position now I think he's just slightly nearer to the keeper than Laws. The yellow card for a foul on Jochim and but Laws will be relieved he certainly could have gone for that. Some referees might have interpreted that as a sending off offence. Whitlow driving the free kick into the wall and then lays it off to Lewis stabbed in and away by Collimore. Whitlow again finding Thomson now Agnew Pearce up well and Agnew on to it again Lewis Oldfield comes into the game Thomson. Good football this by Leicester Jochim across by Greyson Ormanroyd coming in on the back post. Pearce gets it away to Oldfield well he's scored some really spectacular goals in his career David Oldfield and he wasn't far off with that shot. I must confess when this one dropped down at him and he chested it out it's a lovely little bit of link up play by Jochim again. Good early ball in partial clearance I thought Ormanroyd might have got on that. Partial clearance here from Stewart Pearce. Now this is and I must admit when he pulled the trigger then I thought that was going to go right in the back of the net. But a good piece of attacking play from Weston. All credit to them they know they haven't got a big guy apart from Ormanroyd as an outlet player so they're prepared to be patient and build up and pass the ball al pass their way through. Leicester City in the middle of a good spell of form here. Seventh in the table of the start of play nineteen points from their ten games six wins a draw and three defeats. And unbeaten here at Filbert Street in six matches in League and Cup. Matches in hand on the sides all around them in the table and of course the team that has gone very very close to promotion the last two seasons loing losing in the playoff final. Looking in the mood and the form to be up there again. Greyson Gemmell comes in to win it back for Forest. Black was weak in possession and this is Thomson now Oldfield Lewis moving down the left and here he is eventually in possession. But he's lost it again, Forest throw. Stone no problem for Whitlow although that almost dropped in a bit short for Gavin Ward. We do see the problems we've seen it at both ends the goalkeepers have when people chase a lost cause like Rozario's just done there. You know rea no real no real problems at first but then they chase put the keeper under pressure and the keepers tend to panic. Midway through the first half here at Filbert Street still Leicester City nil Nottingham Forest nil but a good game. Good kick there by Ward Chettle wins it Thomson finding Agnew there's Leicester build now with Greyson Thomson Lewis making a run down the left Agnew wins it back again for Leicester, he's playing well. Thomson Jochim and Gemmell accepts the gift and then gives it back to Oldfield. And a little untidy period of play but here's Lewis to Ormanroyd Speedy sets it up for Greyson and in it goes again towards Agnew the captain and did that cross the line yes it's a corner. Well some of the football Leicester have played in this opening twenty o twenty minutes has been some of the best I've seen them. I I've probably seen them about four or five times in the last six months and they do tend to go a bit route one when Walsh is playing but today their link up play has been excellent. Thomson with the corner he's looking for Whitlow but it was headed by Rozario Thomson can try again. And that flicked off the defender and bounced kindly with Tommy Wright. But apart from this er for Leicester this Alan now they're starting to s squeeze a little bit and they've got to be a little bit careful they don't leave Collimore too much space to run into. But at the moment they're starting to dominate the game. Good header by Rozario Collimore couldn't control it and that's the sort of link up Frank Clarke'll be looking for. Ball onto Rozario a little touch through and then the blistering pace of er Collimore. Rozario wearing a vest I notice there Ron he wouldn't get into your team wearing a vest would he? Jochim turns it through to Speedy who couldn't repeat the dose. Here's Thomson and now Lewis turned back again by Ormanroyd and Leicester playing some good football in Forest's half. I think Leicester public are gonna have to be a little bit patient with their team. I mean Forest are pulling everybody behind the ball and you know they can't just sling the ball through. They're working is through and they they're playing some super little link up stuff. He's offside here it won't count. Long before er it got to Oldfield Speedy was offside. I mean we haven't seen an awful lot of er Julian Jochim yet but th the two occasions when the ball's been fed into him he's shown a brilliant ability to turn with the ball and get at the defenders. And I think if if people like Thomson can sort of give him that sort of service he's going to make life awfully difficult for the Forest de central defence. And his partner there of course Speedy he knows h you know he knows what's what in the game doesn't he. He's seen it all he's been there. Yes this is his eleventh League Club Leicester City. I was reading somewhere this morning where he'd been with eight clubs in one season. Good quiz question that one. Agnew turning it on towards Ormanroyd and the header by Laws was excellent. Back in the side now played six in a row. Des Little the signing from Swansea has been rested because er Frank Clarke felt he'd lost a little bit of confidence in Forest's poor start to the season. Ormanroyd wins the header Speedy flicks it on again and Chettle er Chettle rather got it away as Jochim came in on him. Collimore doing well there he really turned Greyson and he's got Black storming down the left and Rozario to the right. Good running by Oldfield to get back. I have to say I think big Stan took the wrong option then you know. It's still chances here for Forest Phillips playing it in again towards Collimore good one handed catch by Ward. I thought Collimore had good break three against two and I thought the the ball he should have played he should have measured a ball into er Kingsley Black's stride. It would have given a similar sort of chance to the one he missed in the first minute. Ormanroyd winning another header inevitably. Jochim to Speedy Ormanroyd's lay-off a good one for Lewis gets it in quickly on the left foot Ormanroyd and then Speedy collided with Pearce as he went in to try and turn the ball goalwards and it's all ended up a goal kick. Another very dangerous tact. I thought Ormanroyd g got more on that actually when he headed it. I thought he'd actually caught a defender as he headed it but er he hasn't really got a good contact on the ball. I think as you said earlier the wind is playing a big part in the game and I I would I would imagine er the Forest the Forest management'll be very happy to get to half time no score. I think they would fancy their chances going er with the wind behind them. It's a cold wind too I can tell you a real wintry afternoon here. On the day we lost the hour on the clock it looks as though winter's started in earnest. I think winter started in August. I don't know about in earnest. Well you should never worry you always manage to find the sunshine somewhere don't you? I could do with a little bit up here pall. Here's Collimore. Oh it's a great effort by Collimore. Splendid work there Ron by the big man. Yes he did well. It it's not his best side er his right foot but you know he can weigh in on that side but er he does have a hunger for goals. Which is understandable considering the vein he's in at the moment. That's er eight in seven games for him the last seven. There goes Oldfield Lewis it's exciting this young man when he goes forward like this. Oh it's a tremendous run and it took a very fine tackle by Chettle to stop him. Oh that was brilliant wasn't it? Picked up the pace picked up the square ball here and attacked he went went like a bomb . That's brill no defender in the world whatever level they are likes being attacked with by a pace player running at them. He really forced the issue there didn't he Lewis and caused the corner. That's a tricky corner too turns it back in an Agnew's header and Speedy has turned it in . Half an hour gone the captain has an injury but his side have taken the lead. David Speedy's goal. Yes and thoroughly deserved. I mean we could sense a goal was coming. Good ball in they they've ch changed the tactic a little bit on this one. Thomson he's hit a deeper corner. Yep they've get in each other 's way but there's Speedy a predator yard off the keeper. That's a good area to be on corner kicks when the ball's bobbling about. Just in front of the keeper because it's amazing how many things fall down just in front of the keeper. David Speedy's eighth goal of the season he's top scorer here he got a couple in the last home game against Notts County and that was as Ron perfectly described it a real predator in action there. Well I think it's reasonable to say as well it was one that was deserved wasn't it? They've been threatening that for the last fifteen minutes or so. Had a er not the best of starts but they've taken control of the game for my money o over the last period. Agnew has just er received treatment from Alan Smith. He got kicked in the head by his own player Mike Whitlow there but I don't think he'll mind because er it all contributed to the goal. Fourteen minutes of the first half remaining and Leicester City deservedly in front. Here goes Collimore and Black good ball for Rozario Stone Black again. Needs the cross now and he supplies it towards Collimore touched away and a shot by Phillips took a deflection off Lewis for a corner. And you wouldn't have bet against that fellow volleying one in would you Phillips. I mean that's that's one of his stock in trades he's a superb volleyer of the ball and it was there for a second with a chance was there for a second. Very good signing Phillips has been already he's er played both sides of midfield filled in at centre back as well in recent matches. He's only been with the club a few weeks. Black lifts the corner into the near post and that astonishingly evaded everyone. Jochim took that beautifully Agnew to Speedy good ball. Oldfield nice form out from Leicester. My word they're spraying it around beautifully. Lewis great running by Oldfield just played it in too long for him but he's gonna get it anyway. And a good ball to Lewis Thomson Agnew splendid football from Leicester City. Greyson's cross into the near post Speedy just missed it it almost sat up perfectly for him. Forest on the record a little bit here but they suddenly break themselves and that's great defending again by Whitlow. But at the moment they're on fire Leicester are on fire at the moment. As I say this this fellow the last twenty minutes are the best I've seen Leicester City play for a long long time. And it's been bought upon by necessity really they've had to play their way through and they certainly should be capable of doing that. And some of the buildup play has been tremendous in this period of time. Here was that previous attack Ron. Yeah it's a good good early ball in from Greyson as well. A combination of I would think of about twelve passes but tha they switched the play from side to side Whitlow judging a difficult bounce well. He looks the part at centre back as well. But here's Rozario Gemmell Black Pearce is up in support but he goes for the long ball in and Hill met it first. And that came off Simon Greyson. Oh no it didn't the the linesman changed his mind. I think it was very very important as well for Leicester to get a goal while they're having a good good spell because er there's no there's no doubt I would expect Forest to put a far more sustained pressure on the second half with the wind in their backs. I could see them able to hit their front players a lot easier. What lovely skill that was by Thomson in a very tight situation although in the end he's given it away. For me he's been the best player on the field this first half. Yes. Rozario's lay off well read by Whitlow Agnew Ormanroyd and now Oldfield. Good work though Gemmell came back to rob him. Kingsley Black on the counter attack Rozario slipped I think fortunate to get it back and finds Black in a good position. And Leicester worked hard to win that back. Chettle wins back the header but it's gone straight to Whitlow Thomson takes over and why not the way he's played. Always one to get and usually using it well and he's got a throw-in. Yeah I think the biggest single difference in the two sides at the moment, let's see what happens here first. Turned back to Ormanroyd who couldn't control it first time and that was enough for Forest to win it back. Rozario did well then. Black seeing quite a bit of the ball on this side of the field. Pearce look for Phillips on the right Lewis got there first but it dropped to Stone. Rozario Stone again that was a clever effort really was. It was clever. I don't think the keeper was entitled to do that was he? I think Gavin Ward might have got er got a catch on that. But I was just saying, here let's have a little look at this as he pops it off now. Stone stood it in there just stood it in there but it's it's a bit innocuous really. I suppose safety first is the order of the day. It has produced a corner though. Black will take it swinging it in flicked on by Rozario and the goalkeeper made up for er what might have been an error a moment or two ago by coming bravely in with Pearce right in front of him and Rozario I mean on the flick. I was saying the single biggest difference for me between the two sides has A been the passing but also the movement. There's been some tremendous movement from the Leicester City, if you like the front six the midfield players and the er front three. You know I've talked about Thomson's passing from midfield but you've always got to be have targets to hit you see if you're a passing player and certainly the Leicester players have given him that. And Phillips found Collimore a willing target then but Hill came back to deny it. Yes at the moment he's sort of he he's the lone ranger isn't he Collimore. Always a threat. Oh no what's he Gavin Ward has picked up a back pass. And they've taken the free kick quickly and tried to take full advantage of the situation and the referee has said you can't do that. I think they can Alan I think they can. Be interesting that one isn't it? The goalkeeper's he's committed the cardinal error by picking up the er the back pass, oh he's given a free kick the other way. Well that's mystified me. That's why it happened. Could you call that a deliberate back pass it almost came off Greyson's er foot by mistake. Well I can't see what else he's given this decision for now. Well that was a mystery a little bit initially. Why the second free kick was given in Leicester's favour must remain an even greater one. We need Alfred Hitchcock to sort that one out. Well Gary Newbon somebody's got to unravel the mystery. I mean for me they for me they should be drawing one each actually now . What Alfred Hitchcock and Gary Newbon you mean, or the teams right fair enough. Thomson good ball out to Lewis. That's a fine ball into Speedy and a lovely little lay off to Jochim. Yes that was a very interesting talking point and er no doubt Greavesie'll have a view on that at half time. There's Black Gemmell Pearce bit long to Rozario good ball that, oh he almost chested it down into the path of Stone. Now don't pick this one up Gavin Moore, no he knew about that. Good spell this for Nottingham Forest. Law's in possession looks for Colin Moore in the middle, hand ball. Well that was totally unnecessary from Pete . The ball's he let the ball drop behind him but er he still had a chance to get back on this. I mean Simon Greyson is not not picking up here neither is Colin Hill and really it's come on a little bit sudden but that was totally unnecessary as well. That well we've seen some comic cuts things going in the last five minutes or so haven't we. But I must admit I've got to know what happened with that goal, or free kick in Yes another assignment for the dreaded Newbon I think he'll have to speak to the referee about that. Gemmell straight on to the head of Hill and Thomson dispossessed by Gemmell. Pearce whips it in dangerously and no risks taken by big Mike Whitlow. Corner. Actually they've picked up the pace Forest since the goal erm don't this Leicester are playing anywhere near as well as they were at the time they scored. Corner goes in deep Pearce getting up well and Ward got up better than anyone and good safe hands as well by the keeper. Can smile now. Were we right did he give a free kick? In my book he gave a free kick for Forest. Certainly looks as if he did I mean he didn't give any other indication. Well I can't think why a free kick would have been given for anything else. Er certainly Forest believed it was and Ward believed it was a free kick you could tell by the expression on his face. It's one to leave to half time when we've got a bit more time to er examine the incident perhaps. Here we've only got er what four minutes less than that remaining Leicester leading remaining. Leicester leading one nil against Nottingham Forest. Fortunately no dispute about the goal. Agnew Speedy Thomson not long for Jochim and it's a good ball. Oh well played Colin Cooper. Oh that was almost a classic build up wasn't it? Little ball up to Speedy drops it off to Thomson a good through ball to a running forward Jochim. Ormanroyd Phillips denying the room and Lewis with the cross Speedy getting up well with Pearce and it breaks to Black. Against the wind he can't get any er meat behind the clearance. Greyson Thomson back to the fullback again and he wins it back off Chettle but Cooper's there and that was a foul by Whitlow in the back of Rozario. Play on says the referee Forest in possession. A bit of a luck break there off Oldfield takes it to Collimore. Typical Stan Collimore and now Black. Phillips on the far post well he is a great volleyer of the ball as Ron mentioned before. He's not the greatest header of the ball although he has won a corner. Yeah but you see that was a good chance you know. I mean s Kingsley Black has stood it in here to the second post now if he doesn't feel he can get enough on it to go for goal he should keep it in the danger area just turn it back across the face of the goal and let one of the other lads have a go at it, Collimore or Rozario. Corner kick. Black headed away by Oldfield. And did that cross the line it hasn't yet and Ormanroyd comes out with the ball. I think they're actually appealing for hand ball you know the Forest players. Here's Phillips for Forest still one down Black onto Hill's head. Good clearance Speedy. Oldfield Lewis making a great break again down the left. He really is quick and he's got the chance of a cross here. Knocks it in towards Speedy and got the final ball wrong but a shame he'd done so well. Great great sort of break from the kid there. Think Ed took out one club too many there didn't he? Little little sand wedge would have found er Speedy on the on the back Yes post. And Hill finds Speedy. He's playing well as well Speedy leading the line very well. Here's Jochim. Cooper gets it clear. Phillips for Nottingham Forest. Only about half a minute of the first half remaining and er certainly Whitlow has hardly put a foot wrong at the back for Leicester so far. Played at left back and centre back this season Mike Whitlow. Here's Jochim He needs a bit of help here Cooper breathing down his neck. Did well. Agnew turned in towards Speedy Pearce gets it clear. Good defending in the nick of time but still Leicester press Greyson and again Greyson headed away by Laws to Ormanroyd. That was a chance. Well that was a glorious opportunity wasn't it. Coming off the back of some more good build up play from er Leicester. Good little stand in ball there you see Laws can't quite get it up on it. No he big sticks there falling on his left foot. It maybe came down a little bit too slow for him. I think that's about er the saving grace on that one. He's there to win it back and find Jochim nice turn by him. Taken off him though by Stone. Good work from Rozario now Black down the left-hand side for him. Five men forward here Nottingham Forest. Swung back in towards Rozario. Collimore good tackle by Hill a really effective challenge and Collimore and Hill having a real scrap as the ball comes over and the referee steps in and stern action might be required here by referee Kirby. The referee's got a real problem here. It's bad enough with er Collimore and Hill wrestling on the floor but without the goalkeeper coming and getting involved. Now he was lenient earlier on in the half the official when he might have shown a red card to Laws. Is he going to be similarly lenient again with the two players here. Came on the back of a very very good move as always. And you see the two players tangling on the ground here. I think I don't think big Stan will be very happy with what he's done there. No he was certainly the aggressor more so that Hill. What's it to be? Yellow yellow. Well fair enough we criticize referees often enough for perhaps harshly sending players off I suppose we should compliment Mr Kirby for not showing the red card there. Though I'll say as I said earlier in the half there's some play some referees might have seen that as a sending off offence. What d'you think Ron? Well I saw a sending off yesterday on television that er I thought was nowhere near as severe as that and I must say that he's a very luck man Stan. So the first half ends in real drama. And a lot of talking points for Jimmy Greaves and Tony back in the studio at half time to discuss when they rejoin us after the break with the score here at Filbert Street Leicester City one Nottingham Forest nil. Welcome back. Well not the least interesting moment in that first half was that peculiar back pass and the free kwick kick which followed it and we'll come to that in a moment. Mm. But I think Leicester as Ron was saying look a lot better side without Steve Walsh funny to say. Well what they're doing actually it's quite right because they're they tended to play the long ball to Steve Walsh so that he could head it down and what they're doing actually they've got two four foot eight forwards in Jochim and Speedy and a nine foot seven winger Ormanroyd but because exactly but because of that they're playing the ball through the Forest er midfield and they are looking a lot better side. This is the best I've seen them play for a long time Leicester They're playing Forest type football They're playing very well. Very well indeed Although Forest should have gone ahead within a minute. Forest should have gone ahead first first forty seconds of the game. I mean Black who is consistently doing this along with and Crosby and co. I'd if I if if I was poor old Frank Clarke I'd be tearing me heart out. That that look at that. That's that's that's a terrible terrible effort from from there. And they could have easily been one up at that particular time which was a minute. Then there's a whole different ball game isn't there after that but er And then Leicester got the bit between the teeth and scored what was a very goal really by your standards wasn't it? It was a good goal erm they they played well it was a good move it, we we saw a great run by Lewis to get this corner which was a smashing bit of football. Then Agnew who doesn't out there at all heads it back in and Speedy in the ideal spot in the six yard box a nice little flick on. Er a lot of courage here by Agnew because he can see his own player's gonna go to kick the ball but he doesn't flinch out of it, knows exactly what he's gonna do. Tailor made for Speedy that isn't it. Cos there's always defenders Good goal on the line you can't Yeah be offside. No no no it's a well taken goal and and that's that's what he was looking for just a little touch on. Now let's try to clarify this peculiar moment about the back pass Right mm yes yes yes it was peculiar wasn't it? Well as far as we can work out what actually happened is is the referee does give a free kick for this back pass there. Now it wasn't really a back pass although it did actually come off of Greyson. Keeper picks it up now Rozario you can see is is is protesting. Now the referee's given it and what we reckon here is Rozario's taken the free kick to Gemmell but Gemmell is now offside. Which is fair enough. And that's how we look at it. Now I don't know whether that is the fact that's the sort of assessment we've made. Er that as far as we know is the referee's confirmed that it was offside and actually if you look at that it was offside. I don't think there's much doubt about it is there ? But justice was done really cos it wasn't really a back pass in the first place. No. Er it's just one of those marginal things. Quick thinking by Forest. Penalized there bit unfortunate but justice was done. Yes and Forest have got to find a better route to goal than that and we'll find out whether they can in a few moments. Hello again. One nil to Leicester City good game so far. Let's just have a look at some of the statistics from that eventful first half and er an eye-catching one at the bottom there look fouls conceded twelve to Leicester four to Nottingham Forest. One that Forest got away with Jim. Somewhat surprising that actually isn't it you wouldn't have thought there by Laws would have been that er discrepancy. The the laws for I don't know I mean I get a bit fed up. I keep harking on it and I don't want to be labelled as the man who who constantly whinges about forwards diving. But I don't know there was no attempt really to he went down after Laws had tackled him. I'm sorry I I okay you book the player but it it appears to me that that forwards just don't want to stay on their feet or even try to stay on their feet. And if I was the referee And since it was such a long way from goal there was no no advantage in going down was there ? Oh there was no question of him being no not really. And there was not question of Laws being being er sent off for that. Professional foul and But if I was a referee now unless I saw the forward actually trying to stay on his feet I would view all of those fouls very suspiciously. Right Forest are gonna have the wind behind them Yes in the second half so we can expect to see Collimore racing on to all sorts of long balls now . Well it's up to Stan to yeah to have a go he's got the pace he's the quickest man on the field probably. Apart from Lewis who looks a bit lively Yes. the Leicester full back. Erm and you would expect Stan to with his with him facing goal to have a go. But it doesn't always necessarily apply Ton. Sometimes I we always felt that you'd like to play against the wind it gives you just that Cos it holds the ball up. little bit more control. And er and with the wind sometimes the ball's al that ball's always running away from you and the way goalkeepers play now they tend to come out very quickly and more times than enough they get there first . All right we can grab a quick word with Frank Clarke the Forest Manager who's talking to Garry Newbon. Frank what about this argument that's going on about the free kick that was disallowed? Well I mean I'm not interested in that really till after the game. Erm the referee said it was for offside I mean I'm not I'm not arguing about we'll we'll think about that after the game. Leicester were quite a handful in the first half. Yes yeah they played quite well but I thought we got our game together after the goal and created a few chances ourselves and er if we keep that going we're get something from this. And finally Cooper's shoulder's obviously very bad you've had it taken Yeah er doctor thinks it's best if he comes off. So er we've had to take him off. Thank you. And as a result of that David Phillips who as I was saying in the first half has proved himself to be a very valuable all-rounder already to Forest has slotted back in at centre back again and that Garry Crosby has come on as substitute and taken up his usual position and Phillips' first half position on the right wing. So that's going to be a problem for Nottingham Forest who threatened towards the end of that first half to get back into this game one down remember. David Speedy's goal for Leicester in the first half and with the wind behind Nottingham Forest now ironically is often happens in these cases it seems to have just calmed a little. But with the wind behind Forest I I would think Leicester would be expecting a lot of pressure. Whitlow and his colleagues have looked good under any kind of pressure that Forest have managed to exert so far. It won't be a problem for Phillips slotting in there a very good footballer. Rozario finding Collimore, that's a great turn by Collimore my word the shot has actually gone into the second tier of the stand behind the goal. And having done so beautifully in the buildup how did he get it so wrong with the shot? I think we'll see a lot of this the second half. Rozario looking for the first flick on as you say. He's leaning well back there. There was a suggestion he might just have got you know as that up. *MOT: because every time I go to make the bed or hoover I've gotta move massives of little furry creatures before I can do any jobs. *CHI: I help you. *MOT: you you help?

Now give me that dollar.” “I didn’t promise you a dollar, Tip. It was only fifty cents.” “It’s worth a dollar,” said the boy, screwing up his face. “I had awful hard work getting him here. Told him my mudder would beat me if he didn’t come along and get me off.” “You’re a smart one, Tip—take after your uncle.” “Den it’s worth a dollar.” “Here, I’ll give you seventy-five cents; that is, I’ll see first if he’s there,” added Standish cautiously. “You don’t think I’d lie, do you, Uncle Sam?” said Tip with an injured look. “It wouldn’t be the first time, I’m afraid.” “I take after my uncle,” said Tip, twisting his elf-like features into a grin. “You’ve got me there, Tip. You are a smart one. Where is he?” “Up-stairs, in de room.” “Is he locked in?” “Well, I reckon.” “Come up with me, Tip, and, if I find it’s true, I’ll give you the dollar.” “Come along, den.” Tip went up the rickety staircase, two steps at a time, and Samuel Standish followed in a more leisurely way. Arrived at the landing, Standish signaled to Tip to knock on the door. Tip did so. “Is you dere?” he asked. “Yes; let me out!” cried Gerald eagerly. “What’ll you give me?” Gerald was tempted to answer “a licking,” but he reflected that it would not be prudent. He must temporize. “You’ve played a trick on me, and you don’t deserve anything. But I’ll give you another quarter, and won’t say anything about it.” “So he gave you a quarter, did he, Tip?” inquired Standish. “No; he’s only gassin’,” said Tip. “Now, do you believe he’s dere?” “Yes; it’s all right.” “Where’s de money?” It was like some of the old Bolsover days back again, only with the difference that now he steeled himself to endure all patiently for young Forrester's sake. It disappointed him to see Percy, led away by his company, sometimes lift his heel against him; yet it suited his humour to think it was only right, and a part of his penance, it should be so. Percy's revolt, to do that youth justice, was short-lived and speedily repented of. As soon as his friends were gone he returned to Jeffreys with all his old allegiance, and showed his remorse by forgetting all about his recent conduct. Perhaps the most trying incident in all that trying time to Jeffreys was what occurred on the last day of the Brothertons' visit. The colonel and his family had been so busy seeing the natural beauties of Wildtree, that, till their visit was drawing to an end, they found they had scarcely done justice to the beautiful house itself, and what it contained. Consequently the last evening was spent in a visit _en masse_ to the library where Jeffreys was duly summoned to assist Mr Rimbolt in exhibiting the treasures it contained. As usual when the lady of the house was of the party, the librarian went through his work awkwardly. He answered her questions in a confused manner, and contrived to knock over one or two books in his endeavour to reach down others. He was conscious that some of the company were including him among the curiosities of the place, and that Mr Rimbolt himself was disappointed with the result of the exhibition. He struggled hard to pull himself together, and in a measure succeeded before the visit was over, thanks chiefly to Mrs Rimbolt's temporary absence from the library. The lady returned to announce that coffee was ready in the drawing-room, and Jeffreys, with a sigh of relief, witnessed a general movement towards the door. He was standing rather dismally near the table, counting the seconds till he should be left alone, when Mrs Brotherton advanced to him with outstretched hand. Imagining she was about to wish him good-evening in a more friendly manner than he had expected, he advanced his own hand, when, to his horror and dismay, he felt a half-crown dropped into it, with the half-whispered remark, "We are much obliged to you." He was too staggered to do anything but drop his jaw and stare at the coin until the last of the party had filed from the room, not even observing the look of droll sympathy which Raby, the last to depart, darted at him. Left to himself, one of his now rare fits of temper broke over him. He stormed out of the place and of the little book worries me. A critic on this side has said that my Prefaces to reprints of my earlier works are of the nature of parting kicks, and I have no desire just now to kick this poor innocent. That evil-tempered old woman, Mother Nature, in one of her worst tantrums, has been inflicting so many cuffs and blows on me that she has left me no energy or disposition to kick anything--even myself. The trouble is that I know so little about it. Did I write this book? What then made me do it? In reading a volume of Fors Clavigera I once came upon a passage which sounded well but left me in a mist, and it relieved me to find a footnote to it in which the author says: "This passage was written many years ago and what I was thinking about at the time has quite escaped my memory. At all events, though I let it stand, I can find no meaning in it now." Little men may admire but must not try to imitate these gestures of the giants. And as a result of a little quiet thinking it over I seem able to recover the idea I had in my mind when I composed this child's story and found a title for it in Blake. Something too of the semi-wild spirit of the child hero in the lines: "Naught loves another as itself.... And, father, how can I love you Or any of my brothers more? I love you like the little birds That pick up crumbs about the door." There nature is, after picking up the crumbs to fly away. A long time ago I formed a small collection of children's books of the early years of the nineteenth century; and looking through them, wishing that some of them had fallen into my hands when I was a child I recalled the books I had read at that time--especially two or three. Like any normal child I delighted in such stories as the Swiss Family Robinson, but they were not the books I prized most; they omitted the very quality I liked best--the little thrills that nature itself gave me, which half frightened and fascinated at the same time, the wonder and mystery of it all. Once in a while I got a book with something of this rare element in it, contained perhaps in some perfectly absurd narrative of animals taking human shape or using human speech, with such like transformations and vagaries; they could never be too extravagant, fantastic and incredible, so long as they expressed anything of the feeling I myself experienced when out of sight and sound of my fellow beings, whether out on the great level plain, with a glitter of illusory water all round me, or among the shadowy trees with their bird and insect sounds, or by the waterside and bed of tall dark bull-rushes murmuring in the wind. These ancient memories put it in my mind to write a book which, I imagined, would have suited my peculiar taste of that early period, the impossible story to be founded on my own childish impressions and adventures, with a few dreams and fancies thrown in and two or three native legends and myths, such as the one of the Lady of the Hills, the incarnate spirit of the rocky Sierras on the great plains, about which I heard from my gaucho comrades when on the spot--the strange woman seldom viewed by human eyes who is jealous of man's presence and is able to create sudden violent tempests to frighten them from her sacred haunts. That's the story of my story, and to the question in your publisher's practical mind, I'm sorry to have to say I don't know. I have no way of finding out, since children are not accustomed to write to authors to tell them what they think of their books. And after all these excuses it just occurs to me that children do not read forewords and introductions; they have to be addressed to adults who do not read children's books, so that in any case it would be thrown away. Still if a foreword you must have, and from me, I think you will have to get it out of this letter. I remain, Yours cordially, W. H. HUDSON.

BILLABONG Norah’s home was on a big station in the north of Victoria—so large that you could almost, in her own phrase, “ride all day and never see any one you didn’t want to see”; which was a great advantage in Norah’s eyes. Not that Billabong Station ever seemed to the little girl a place that you needed to praise in any way. It occupied so very modest a position as the loveliest part of the world! The homestead was built on a gentle rise that sloped gradually away on every side; in front to the wide plain, dotted with huge gum trees and great grey box groves, and at the back, after you had passed through the well-kept vegetable garden and orchard, to a long lagoon, bordered with trees and fringed with tall bulrushes and waving reeds. The house itself was old and quaint and rambling, part of the old wattle and dab walls yet remaining in some of the outhouses, as well as the grey shingle roof. There was a more modern part, for the house had been added to from time to time by different owners, though no additions had been made since Norah’s father brought home his young wife, fifteen years before this story opens. Then he had built a large new wing with wide and lofty rooms, and round all had put a very broad, tiled verandah. The creepers had had time to twine round the massive posts in those fifteen years, and some even lay in great masses on the verandah roof; tecoma, pink and salmon-coloured; purple bougainvillea, and the snowy mandevillea clusters. Hard-headed people said this was not good for the building—but Norah’s mother had planted them, and because she had loved them they were never touched. There was a huge front garden, not at all a proper kind of garden, but a great stretch of smooth buffalo grass, dotted with all kinds of trees, amongst which flower beds cropped up in most unexpected and unlikely places, just as if some giant had flung them out on the grass like a handful of pebbles that scattered as they flew. They were always trim and tidy, and the gardener, Hogg, was terribly strict, and woe betide the author of any small footmarks that he found on one of the freshly raked surfaces. Nothing annoyed him more than the odd bulbs that used to come up in the midst of his precious buffalo grass; impertinent crocuses and daffodils and hyacinths, that certainly had no right there. “Blest if I know how they ever gets there!” Hogg would say, scratching his head. Whereat Norah was wont to retire behind a pyramid tree for purposes of mirth. Hogg’s sworn foe was Lee Wing, the Chinese gardener, who reigned supreme in the orchard and the kingdom of vegetables—not quite the same thing as the vegetable kingdom, by the way! Lee Wing was very fat, his broad, yellow face generally wearing a cheerful grin—unless he happened to catch sight of Hogg. His long pigtail was always concealed under his flapping straw hat. Once Jim, who was Norah’s big brother, had found him asleep in his hut with the pigtail drooping over the edge of the bunk. Jim thought the opportunity too good to lose and, with such deftness that the Celestial never stirred, he tied the end of the pigtail to the back of a chair—with rather startling results when Lee Wing awoke with a sudden sense of being late, and made a spring from the bunk. The chair of course followed him, and the loud yell of fear and pain raised by the victim brought half the homestead to the scene of the catastrophe. Jim was the only one who did not wait for developments. He found business at the lagoon. The queerest part of it was that Lee Wing firmly believed Hogg to be the author of his woe. Nothing moved him from this view, not even when Jim, finding how matters stood, owned up like a man. “You allee same goo’ boy,” said the pigtailed one, proffering him a succulent raw turnip. “Me know. You tellee fine large crammee. Hogg, he tellee crammee, too. So dly up!” And Jim, finding expostulation useless, “dried up” accordingly and ate the turnip, which was better than the leek. To the right of the homestead at Billabong a clump of box trees sheltered the stables that were the unspoken pride of Mr. Linton’s heart. Before his time the stables had been a conglomerate mass, bark-roofed, slab-sided, falling to decay; added to as each successive owner had thought fit, with a final mixture of old and new that was neither convenient nor beautiful. Mr. Linton had apologised to his horses during his first week of occupancy and, in the second, turning them out to grass with less apology, had pulled down the rickety old sheds, replacing them with a compact and handsome building of red brick, with room for half a dozen buggies, men’s quarters, harness and feed rooms, many loose boxes and a loft where a ball could have been held—and where, indeed, many a one was held, when all the young farmers and stockmen and shearers from far and near brought each his lass and tripped it from early night to early dawn, to the strains of old Andy Ferguson’s fiddle and young Dave Boone’s concertina. Norah had been allowed to look on at one or two of these gatherings. She thought them the height of human bliss, and was only sorry that sheer inability to dance prevented her from “taking the floor” with Mick Shanahan, the horse breaker, who had paid her the compliment of asking her first. It was a great compliment, too, Norah felt, seeing what a man of agility and splendid accomplishments was Mick—and that she was only nine at the time. There was one loose box which was Norah’s very own property, and without her permission no horse was ever put in it except its rightful occupant—Bobs, whose name was proudly displayed over the door in Jim’s best carving. Bobs had always belonged to Norah, He had been given to her as a foal, when Norah used to ride a round little black sheltie, as easy to fall off as to mount. He was a beauty even then, Norah thought; and her father had looked approvingly at the long-legged baby, with his fine, well-bred head. “You will have something worth riding when that fellow is fit to break in, my girlie,” he had said, and his prophecy had been amply fulfilled. Mick Shanahan said he’d never put a leg over a finer pony. Norah knew there never had been a finer anywhere. He was a big pony, very dark bay in colour, and “as handsome as paint,” and with the kindest disposition; full of life and “go,” but without the smallest particle of vice. It was an even question which loved the other best, Bobs or Norah. No one ever rode him except his little mistress. The pair were hard to beat—so the men said. To Norah the stables were the heart of Billabong. The house was all very well—of course she loved it; and she loved her own little room, with its red carpet and dainty white furniture, and the two long windows that looked out over the green plain. That was all right; so were the garden and the big orchard, especially in summer time! The only part that was not “all right” was the drawing-room—an apartment of gloomy, seldom-used splendour that Norah hated with her whole heart. But the stables were an abiding refuge. She was never dull there. Apart from the never-failing welcome in Bobs’ loose box, there was the dim, fragrant loft, where the sunbeams only managed to send dusty rays of light across the gloom. Here Norah used to lie on the sweet hay and think tremendous thoughts; here also she laid deep plans for catching rats—and caught scores in traps of her own devising. Norah hated rats, but nothing could induce her to wage war against the mice. “Poor little chaps!” she said; “they’re so little—and—and soft!” And she was quite saddened if by chance she found a stray mouse in any of her shrewdly-designed traps for the benefit of the larger game which infested the stables and had even the hardihood to annoy Bobs! Norah had never known her mother. She was only a tiny baby when that gay little mother died—a sudden, terrible blow, that changed her father in a night from a young man to an old one. It was nearly twelve years ago, now, but no one ever dared to speak to David Linton of his wife. Sometimes Norah used to ask Jim about mother—for Jim was fifteen, and could remember just a little; but his memories were so vague and misty that his information was unsatisfactory. And, after all, Norah did not trouble much. She had always been so happy that she could not imagine that to have had a mother would have made any particular difference to her happiness. You see, she did not know. She had grown just as the bush wild flowers grow—hardy, unchecked, almost untended; for, though old nurse had always been there, her nurseling had gone her own way from the time she could toddle. She was everybody’s pet and plaything; the only being who had power to make her stern, silent father smile—almost the only one who ever saw the softer side of his character. He was fond and proud of Jim—glad that the boy was growing up straight and strong and manly, able to make his way in the world. But Norah was his heart’s desire. Of course she was spoilt—if spoiling consists in rarely checking an impulse. All her life Norah had done pretty well whatever she wanted—which meant that she had lived out of doors, followed in Jim’s footsteps wherever practicable (and in a good many ways most people would have thought distinctly impracticable), and spent about two-thirds of her waking time on horseback. But the spoiling was not of a very harmful kind. Her chosen pursuits brought her under the unspoken discipline of the work of the station, wherein ordinary instinct taught her to do as others did, and conform to their ways. She had all the dread of being thought “silly” that marks the girl who imitates boyish ways. Jim’s rare growl, “Have a little sense!” went farther home than a whole volume of admonitions of a more ordinarily genuine feminine type. She had no little girl friends, for none was nearer than the nearest township—Cunjee, seventeen miles away. Moreover, little girls bored Norah frightfully. They seemed a species quite distinct from herself. They prattled of dolls; they loved to skip, to dress up and “play ladies”; and when Norah spoke of the superior joys of cutting out cattle or coursing hares over the Long Plain, they stared at her with blank lack of understanding. With boys she got on much better. Jim and she were tremendous chums, and she had moped sadly when he went to Melbourne to school. Holidays then became the shining events of the year, and the boys whom Jim brought home with him, at first prone to look down on the small girl with lofty condescension, generally ended by voting her “no end of a jolly kid,” and according her the respect due to a person who could teach them more of bush life than they had dreamed of. But Norah’s principal mate was her father. Day after day they were together, riding over the run, working the cattle, walking through the thick scrub of the backwater, driving young, half-broken horses in the high dog-cart to Cunjee—they were rarely apart. David Linton seldom made a plan that did not naturally include Norah. She was a wise little companion, too; ready enough to chatter like a magpie if her father were in the mood, but quick to note if he were not, and then quite content to be silently beside him, perhaps for hours. They understood each other perfectly. Norah never could make out the people who pitied her for having no friends of her own age. How could she possibly be bothered with children, she reflected, when she had Daddy? As for Norah’s education, that was of the kind best defined as a minus quantity. “I won’t have her bothered with books too early,” Mr. Linton had said when nurse hinted, on Norah’s eight birthday, that it was time she began the rudiments of learning. “Time enough yet—we don’t want to make a bookworm of her!” Whereat nurse smiled demurely, knowing that that was the last thing to be afraid of in connexion with her child. But she worried in her responsible old soul all the same; and when a wet day or the occasional absence of Mr. Linton left Norah without occupation, she induced her to begin a few elementary lessons. The child was quick enough, and soon learned to read fairly well and to write laboriously; but there nurse’s teaching from books ended. Of other and practical teaching, however, she had a greater store. Mr. Linton had a strong leaning towards the old-fashioned virtues, and it was at a word from him that Norah had gone to the kitchen and asked Mrs. Brown to teach her to cook. Mrs. Brown—fat, good-natured and adoring—was all acquiescence, and by the time Norah was eleven she knew more of cooking and general housekeeping than many girls grown up and fancying themselves ready to undertake houses of their own. Moreover, she could sew rather well, though she frankly detested the accomplishment. The one form of work she cared for was knitting, and it was her boast that her father wore only the socks she manufactured for him. Norah’s one gentle passion was music. Never taught, she inherited from her mother a natural instinct and an absolutely true ear, and before she was seven she could strum on the old piano in a way very satisfying to herself and awe-inspiring to the admiring nurse. Her talent increased yearly, and at ten she could play anything she heard—from ear, for she had never been taught a note of music. It was, indeed, her growing capabilities in this respect that forced upon her father the need for proper tuition for the child. However, a stopgap was found in the person of the book-keeper, a young Englishman, who knew more of music than accounts. He readily undertook Norah’s instruction, and the lessons bore moderately good effect—the moderation being due to a not unnatural disinclination on the pupil’s part to walk where she had been accustomed to run, and to a fixed loathing to practice. As the latter necessary, if uninteresting, pursuit was left entirely to her own discretion—for no one ever dreamed of ordering Norah to the piano—it is small wonder if it suffered beside the superior attractions of riding Bobs, rat trapping, “shinning up” trees, fishing in the lagoon and generally disporting herself as a maiden may whom conventional restrictions have never trammelled. It follows that the music lessons, twice a week, were times of woe for Mr. Groom, the teacher. He was an earnest young man, with a sincere desire for his pupil’s improvement, and it was certainly disheartening to find on Friday that the words of Tuesday had apparently gone in at one ear and out at the other simultaneously. Sometimes he would remonstrate. “You haven’t got on with that piece a bit!” “What’s the good?” the pupil would remark, twisting round on the music stool; “I can play nearly all of it from ear!” “That’s not the same”—severely—“that’s only frivolling. I’m not here to teach you to strum.” “No” Norah would agree abstractedly. “Mr. Groom, you know that poley bullock down in the far end paddock—” “No, I don’t,” severely. “This is a music lesson, Norah; you’re not after cattle now!” “Wish I were!” sighed the pupil. “Well, will you come out with the dogs this afternoon?” “Can’t; I’m wanted in the office. Now, Norah—” “But if I asked father to spare you?” “Oh, I’d like to right enough.” Mr. Groom was young, and the temptress, if younger, was skilled in wiles. “But your father—” “Oh, I can manage Dad. I’ll go and see him now.” She would be at the door before her teacher perceived that his opportunity was vanishing. “Norah, come back! If I’m to go out, you must play this first—and get it right.” Mr. Groom could be firm on occasions. “Come along, you little shirker!” and Norah would unwillingly return to the music stool, and worry laboriously though a page of the hated Czerny. CHAPTER II. PETS AND PLAYTHINGS After her father, Norah’s chief companions were her pets. These were a numerous and varied band, and required no small amount of attention. Bobs, of course, came first—no other animal could possibly approach him in favour. But after Bobs came a long procession, beginning with Tait, the collie, and ending with the last brood of fluffy Orpington chicks, or perhaps the newest thing in disabled birds, picked up, fluttering and helpless, in the yard or orchard. There was room in Norah’s heart for them all. Tait was a beauty—a rough-haired collie, with a splendid head, and big, faithful brown eyes, that spoke more eloquently than many persons’ tongues. He was, like most of the breed, ready to be friends with any one; but his little mistress was dearest of all, and he worshipped her with abject devotion. Norah never went anywhere without him; Tait saw to that. He seemed always on the watch for her coming, and she was never more than a few yards from the house before the big dog was silently brushing the grass by her side. His greatest joy was to follow her on long rides into the bush, putting up an occasional hare and scurrying after it in the futile way of collies, barking at the swallows overhead, and keeping pace with Bobs’ long, easy canter. Puck used to come on these excursions too. He was the only being for whom it was suspected that Tait felt a mild dislike—an impudent Irish terrier, full of fun and mischief, yet with a somewhat unfriendly and suspicious temperament that made him, perhaps, a better guardian for Norah than the benevolently disposed Tait. Puck had a nasty, inquiring mind—an unpleasant way of sniffing round the legs of tramps that generally induced those gentry to find the top rail of a fence a more calm and more desirable spot than the level of the ground. Indian hawkers feared him and hated him in equal measure. He could bite, and occasionally did bite, his victims being always selected with judgment and discretion, generally vagrants emboldened to insolence by seeing no men about the kitchen when all hands were out mustering or busy on the run. When Puck bit, it was with no uncertain tooth. He was suspected of a desire to taste the blood of every one who went near Norah, though his cannibalistic propensities were curbed by stern discipline. Only once had he had anything like a free hand—or a free tooth. Norah was out riding, a good way from the homestead, when a particularly unpleasant-looking fellow accosted her, and asked for money. Norah stared. “I haven’t got any,” she said. “Anyhow, father doesn’t let us give away money to travellers—only tucker.” “Oh, doesn’t he?” the fellow said unpleasantly. “Well, I want money, not grub.” He laid a compelling hand on Bobs’ bridle as Norah tried to pass him. “Come,” he said—“that bracelet’ll do!” It was a pretty little gold watch set in a leather bangle—father’s birthday present, only a few weeks old. Norah simply laughed—she scarcely comprehended so amazing a thing as that this man should really intend to rob her. “Get out of my way,” she said—“you can’t have that!” “Can’t I!” He caught her wrist. “Give it quietly now, or I’ll—” The sentence was not completed. A yellow streak hurled itself though the air, as Puck, who had been investigating a tussock for lizards, awoke to the situation. Something like a vice gripped the swagman by the leg, and he dropped Norah’s wrist and bridle and roared like any bull. The “something” hung on fiercely, silently, and the victim hopped and raved and begged for mercy. Norah had ridden a little way on. She called softly to Puck. “Here, boy!” Puck did not relinquish his grip. He looked pleadingly at his little mistress across the swagman’s trouser-leg. Norah struck her saddle sharply with her whip. “Here, sir!—drop it!” Puck dropped it reluctantly, and came across to Bobs, his head hanging. The swagman sat down on the ground and nursed his leg. “That served you right,” Norah said, with judicial severity. “You hadn’t any business to grab my watch. Now, if you’ll go up to the house they’ll give you some tucker and a rag for your leg!” She rode off, whistling to Puck. The swagman gaped and muttered various remarks. He did not call at the house. Norah was supposed to manage the fowls, but her management was almost entirely ornamental, and it is to be feared that the poultry yard would have fared but poorly had it depended upon her alone. All the fowls were hers. She said so, and no one contradicted her. Still, whenever one was wanted for the table, it was ruthlessly slain. And it was black Billy who fed them night and morning, and Mrs. Brown who gathered the eggs, and saw that the houses were safely shut against the foxes every evening. Norah’s chief part in the management lay in looking after the setting hens. At first she firmly checked the broody instincts by shutting them callously under boxes despite pecks and loud protests. Later, when their mood refused to change, she loved to prepare them soft nests in boxes, and to imprison them there until they took kindly to their seclusion. Then it was hard work to wait three weeks until the first fluffy heads peeped out from the angry mother’s wing, after which Norah was a blissfully adoring caretaker until the downy balls began to get ragged, as the first wing and tail feathers showed. Then the chicks became uninteresting, and were handed over to Black Billy. Besides her own pets there were Jim’s. “Mind, they’re in your care,” Jim had said sternly, on the evening before his departure for school. They were making a tour of the place—Jim outwardly very cheerful and unconcerned; Norah plunged in woe. She did not attempt to conceal it. She had taken Jim’s arm, and it was sufficient proof of his state of mind that he did not shake it off. Indeed, the indications were that he was glad of the loving little hand tucked into the bend of his arm. “Yes, Jim; I’ll look after them.” “I don’t want you to bother feeding them yourself,” Jim said magnanimously; “that ’ud be rather too much of a contract for a kid, wouldn’t it? Only keep an eye on ’em, and round up Billy if he doesn’t do his work. He’s a terror if he shirks, and unless you watch him like a cat he’ll never change the water in the tins every morning. Lots of times I’ve had to do it myself!” “I’d do it myself sooner’n let them go without, Jim, dear,” said the small voice, with a suspicion of a choke. “Don’t you do it,” said Jim; “slang Billy. What’s he here for, I’d like to know! I only want you to go round ’em every day, and see that they’re all right.” So daily Norah used to make her pilgrimage round Jim’s pets. There were the guinea pigs—a rapidly increasing band, in an enclosure specially built for them by Jim—a light frame, netted carefully everywhere, and so constructed that it could be moved from place to place, giving them a fresh grass run continually. Then there were two young wallabies and a little brush kangaroo, which lived in a little paddock all their own, and were as tame as kittens. Norah loved this trio especially, and always had a game with them on her daily visit. There was a shy gentleman which Norah called a turloise, because she never could remember if he were a turtle or a tortoise. He lived in a small enclosure, with a tiny water hole, and his disposition was extremely retiring. In private Norah did not feel drawn to this member of her charge, but she paid him double attention, from an inward feeling of guilt, and because Jim set a high value upon him. “He’s such a wise old chap,” Jim would say; “nobody knows what he’s thinking of!” In her heart of hearts Norah did not believe that mattered very much. But when the stables had been visited and Bobs and Sirdar (Jim’s neglected pony) interviewed; when Tait and Puck had had their breakfast bones; when wallabies and kangaroo had been inspected (with a critical eye to their water tins), and the turtle had impassively received a praiseworthy attempt to draw him out; when the chicks had all been fed, and the guinea pigs (unlike the leopard) had changed their spot for the day—there still remained the birds. The birds were a colony in themselves. There was a big aviary, large enough for little trees and big shrubs to grow in, where a happy family lived whose members included several kinds of honey-eaters, Queensland finches, blackbirds and a dozen other tiny shy things which flitted quickly from bush to bush all day. They knew Norah and, when she entered their home, would flutter down and perch on her head and shoulders, and look inquisitively for the flowers she always brought them. Sometimes Norah would wear some artificial flowers, by way of a joke. It was funny to see the little honey-eaters thrusting in their long beaks again and again in search of the sweet drops they had learned to expect in flowers, and funnier still to watch the air of disgust with which they would give up the attempt. There were doves everywhere—not in cages, for they never tried to escape. Their soft “coo” murmured drowsily all around. There were pigeons, too, in a most elaborate pigeon cote—another effort of Jim’s carpentering skill. These were as tame as the smaller birds, and on Norah’s appearance would swoop down upon her in a cloud. They had done so once when she was mounted on Bobs, to the pony’s very great alarm and disgust. He took to his heels promptly. “I don’t think he stopped for two miles!” Norah said. Since then, however, Bobs had grown used to the pigeons fluttering and circling round him. It was a pretty sight to watch them all together, child and pony half hidden beneath their load of birds. The canaries had a cage to themselves—a very smart one, with every device for making canary life endurable in captivity. Certainly Norah’s birds seemed happy enough, and the sweet songs of the canaries were delightful. I think they were Norah’s favourites amongst her feathered flock. Finally there were two talkative members—Fudge the parrot, and old Caesar, a very fine white cockatoo. Fudge had been caught young, and his education had been of a liberal order. An apt pupil, he had picked up various items of knowledge, and had blended them into a whole that was scarcely harmonious. Bits of slang learned from Jim and the stockmen were mingled with fragments of hymns warbled by Mrs. Brown and sharp curt orders delivered to dogs. A French swag-man, who had hurt his foot and been obliged to camp for a few days at the homestead, supplied Fudge with several Parisian remarks that were very effective. Every member of the household had tried to teach him to whistle some special tune. Unfortunately, the lessons had been delivered at the same time, and the result was the most amazing jumble of melody, which Fudge delivered with an air of deepest satisfaction. As Jim said, “You never know if he’s whistling ‘God Save the King,’ ‘Pop Goes the Weasel,’ or ‘The Wearin’ o’ the Green,’ but it doesn’t make any difference to Fudge’s enjoyment!” Caesar was a giant among cockatoos, and had a full sense of his own importance. He had been shot when very young, some stray pellets having found their way into his wing. Norah had found him fluttering helplessly along the ground, and had picked him up, sustaining a severe peck in doing so. It was, however, the first and last peck he ever gave Norah. From that moment he seemed to recognize her as a friend, and to adopt her as an intimate—marks of esteem he accorded to very few others. Norah had handed him to Jim on arriving at the house, a change which the bird resented by a savage attack on Jim’s thumb. Jim was no hero—at the age of eleven, he dropped the cockatoo like a hot coal. “Great Caesar!” he exclaimed, sucking his thumb, and Caesar he was christened in that moment. After his recovery, which was a long and tedious process, Caesar showed no inclination to leave the homestead. He used to strut about the back yard, and frequent the kitchen door, very much after the fashion of a house-dog. He was, indeed, as valuable as a watch-dog, for the appearance of any stranger was the signal for a volley of shrieks and chatter, sufficient to alarm any household. However, Caesar’s liberty had to be restricted, for he became somewhat of a menace to all he did not choose to care for, and his attacks on the ankles were no joking matter. To the dogs he was a constant terror. He hated all alike, and would “go for” big Tait as readily as for cheerful little Puck, and not a dog on the place would face him. So at last a stand and a chain were bought for Caesar, and on his perch he lived in solitary splendour, while his enemies took good care to keep beyond his reach. Norah he always loved, and those whom he had managed to bite—their number was large—used to experience thrills on seeing the little girl hold him close to her face while he rubbed his beak up and down her cheek. He tolerated black Billy, who fed him, and was respectful to Mr. Linton; but he worshipped Mrs. Brown, the cook, and her appearance at the kitchen door, which he could see from his stand, caused an instant outbreak of cheers and chatter, varied by touching appeals to “scratch Cocky.” His chief foe was Mrs. Brown’s big yellow cat, who not only dared to share the adored one’s affections, but was openly aggressive at times, and loved to steal the cockatoo’s food. Caesar, on his perch, apparently wrapped in dreamless slumber, would in reality be watching the stealthy movements of Tim, the cat, who would come scouting through the grass towards the tin of food. Just out of reach, Tim would lie down and feign sleep as deep as Caesar’s, though every muscle in his body was tense with readiness for the sudden spring. So they would remain, perhaps many minutes. Tim’s patience never gave out. Sometimes Caesar’s would, and he would open his eyes and flap round on his perch, shouting much bad bird language at the retreating Tim. But more often both remained motionless until the cat sprang suddenly at the food tin. More often than not he was too quick for Caesar, and would drag the tin beyond reach of the chain before the bird could defend it, in which case the wrath of the defeated was awful to behold. But sometimes Caesar managed to anticipate the leap, and Tim did not readily forget those distressful moments when the cockatoo had him by the fur with beak and claw. He would escape, showing several patches where his coat had been torn, and remained in a state of dejection for two or three days, during which battles were discontinued. It took Caesar almost as long to recover from the wild state of triumph into which his rare victories threw him. CHAPTER III. A MENAGERIE RACE The first time that Jim returned from school was for the Easter holidays. He brought a couple of mates with him—boys from New South Wales and Queensland, Harry Trevor and Walter Meadows. Harry was a little older than Jim—a short, thick-set lad, very fair and solemn, with expressionless grey eyes, looking out beneath a shock of flaxen hair. Those who knew him not said that he was stupid. Those who knew him said that you couldn’t tell old Harry much that he didn’t know. Those who knew him very well said that you could depend on Trevor to his last gasp. Jim loved him—and there were few people Jim loved. Walter—or Wally—Meadows was a different type; long and thin for fourteen, burnt to almost Kaffir darkness; a wag of a boy, with merry brown eyes, and a temperament unable to be depressed for more than five minutes at a time. He was always in scrapes at school, but a great favourite with masters and boys notwithstanding; and he straightway laid his boyish heart down at Norah’s feet, and was her slave from the first day they met. Norah liked them both. She had been desperately afraid that they would try to take Jim away from her, and was much relieved to find that they welcomed her cheerfully into their plans. They were good riders, and the four had splendid gallops over the plains after hares. Also they admired Bobs fervently, and that was always a passport to Norah’s heart. It was on the third day of their visit, and they were making the morning round of the pets, when a brilliant idea came to Wally. “Let’s have a menagerie race!” he cried suddenly. “What’s that?” Norah asked blankly. “Why, you each drive an animal,” explained Wally, the words tumbling over one another in his haste. “Say you drive the kangaroo, ’n me the wallabies, ’n Jim the Orpington rooster, ’n we’ll give old Harry the tortoise—turloise, I beg pardon!” “Thanks,” said Harry dryly. “The tortoise scored once, you know, young Wally!” “Well, old man, you take him,” Wally said kindly. “Wouldn’t stand in your way for a moment. We can use harness, can’t we?” “Don’t know,” Jim said. “I never studied the rules of menagerie racing. Use bridles, anyhow. It’s a good idea, I think. Let’s see how many starters we can muster.” They cruised round. Dogs were barred as being too intelligent—horses were, of course, out of the question. Finally they fixed on the possible candidates. They were the kangaroo, the wallabies, a big black Orpington “rooster,” Fudge the parrot, Caesar the cockatoo, Mrs. Brown’s big yellow cat, Tim, and the “turloise.” “Eight,” said Harry laconically. The starters were all mustered in one enclosure, and were on the worst of terms. “We’ll need more jockeys—if you call ’em jockeys.” “Well, there’s black Billy,” Jim said; “he’s available, and he’ll drive whichever he’s told, and that’s a comfort. That’s five. And we’ll rouse out old Lee Wing, and Hogg, that’s a ripping idea, ’cause they hate each other so. Seven. Who’s eight? Oh, I know! We’ll get Mrs. Brown.” Mrs. Brown was accordingly bearded in her den and, protesting vigorously that she had no mind for racing, haled forth into the open. She was a huge woman, as good-natured as she was fat, which said a good deal. In her print dress, with enormous white apron and flapping sun bonnet, she looked as unlikely a “jockey” as could be imagined. Lee Wing, discovered in the onion bed, was presently brought to the scratch, despite his protests. He said he “couldn’t lun,” but was told that in all probability no running would be required of him. He also said “no can dlive” many times, and further remarked, “Allee same gleat bosh.” When he saw his arch enemy Hogg among the competitors his resentment was keen, and Wally was told off to restrain him from flight. Wally’s own idea was to tie him up by the pigtail, but this Jim was prudent enough to forbid. Hogg was, as Jim put it, rooting amongst the roses, and grunted freely on his way to the post. He could never refuse Norah anything, but this proceeding was much beneath his dignity, and the sight of Lee Wing did not tend to improve his view of the matter. He stood aloof, with a cold, proud smile, like a hero of melodrama. Black Billy was, of course, in the stables, and came with alacrity. He had not much English and that little was broken, but he worshipped the Linton children—Jim especially, and would obey him with the unquestioning obedience of a dog. “All here?” asked Jim, looking round. “Five, six, eight—that’s all serene. Now who’s going to drive who?” Opinions on that point were mixed. Every one wanted the kangaroo, and at last a general vote gave him to Norah. Wally chose one Wallaby. He said it was only natural, and made a further remark about the feelings of the others when “Wally and his wallaby should wallow by them” that was happily quenched by Harry, who adopted the simple plan of sitting on the orator. Harry secured the second wallaby, and black Billy was given the Orpington rooster as his steed. Mrs. Brown from the first applied for the tortoise. She said it meant less exertion, and she preferred to be slow and sure, without any risk of over-work. Hogg chose the yellow cat, Tim, and Lee Wing was given Caesar, the cockatoo. “Leaving old Fudge for me,” Jim said ruefully. “What sort of a chance do you think I’ve got? Never mind, I’m used to being suppressed.” “Good for you,” observed Harry. “Now, how about harness?” “Well, we’ll leave that to individual taste,” Jim said. “Here’s a ball of string, and there are plenty of light straps. Mrs. Brown—you’re the leading lady. How shall I harness your prancing steed for you?” “You will have your joke, Master Jim,” retorted Mrs. Brown, bridling and beaming. “Now, I don’t think I’ll harness my poor beastie at all. Give me a couple of sticks to keep his head the right way and to poke him gently, and we’ll beat you all yet!” Norah and the two boys fixed up fearful and wonderful harness for their nominations—collars of straps, and long string headpieces and reins. The animals objected strongly to being harnessed, and the process was most entertaining. Mrs. Brown was particularly appreciative, and at length in a paroxysm of mirth narrowly escaped sitting down on the tortoise. Black Billy’s harness was not extensive. He tied a string round the black Orpington’s leg, and retired to the stable for a few minutes, returning with a bulging pocket, the contents of which he did not communicate. Hogg did not attempt to bit and bridle the yellow cat, which was much annoyed at the whole proceeding. Instead he fixed up a collar and traces of string, and chose a long cane, more, he said, for purposes of defence than for anything else. Lee Wing and Jim harnessed their steeds in the same way—with a long string tied to each leg. “All ready?” Jim queried. “Toe the line!” The course was across a small paddock near the house—a distance of about thirty yards—and the competitors were ranged up with no little difficulty. Luckily, the line was a wide one, admitting of considerable space between each starter, or the send-off might have been inextricably confused. However, they were all arranged at last, and Jim, in a stentorian voice, gave the word to “Go.” As the signal was given, the drivers urged on their steeds according to their judgment, and with magnificent results. First to get off the line were the wallabies and the kangaroo. They fled, each his several way, and after them went their drivers, in great haste. The kangaroo had all the best of the start. So remarkable was his bound that he twitched his reins quite out of Norah’s hands, and made for the fence of the paddock. It was an open one, which let him through easily. The wallabies, seeing his shining success, followed his course, and midway managed to entangle their reins, at which Wally and Harry were wildly hauling. Confusion became disorder, and the wallabies at length reduced themselves to a tangle, out of which they had to be assisted by means of Harry’s pocket knife. Jim had no luck. The parrot went off well, but very soon seemed to regret his rashness and, despite all Jim’s endeavours, returned with solemnity to the start, where he paused and talked fluently in the mixed language that was all his own. In desperation Jim tried to pull him along, but Fudge simply walked round and round him, until he had exhausted his driver’s patience, and was “turned out.” The most spirited of the competitors were decidedly the cockatoo and Tim. They were panting for each other’s blood from the start, and before they had been urged over a quarter of the way they found an opportunity of warfare, and seized it simultaneously. Then the air grew murky with sound—cockatoo shrieks, mingled with cat calls and fluent Chinese, cutting across Hogg’s good, broad Scots. Naturally, the strings of the harness became fatally twisted immediately, and soon the combatants were bound together with a firmness which not all the efforts of their drivers could undo. A sudden movement of the pair made Lee Wing spring back hastily, whereupon he tripped and stumbled violently against Hogg. Hogg’s temper was at vanishing point, and this was the last straw. “Ye pig-tailed image!” he exclaimed furiously. Drawing back, he aimed a blow at Lee Wing, which would have effectively put that gentle Mongolian out of the race had he not dodged quickly. He shouted something in his own language, which was evidently of no complimentary nature, and hurled himself like a yellow tornado upon the angry Scotsman. They struck out at each other with all possible ill-will, but their science was much impeded by the fact that the cat and cockatoo were fighting fiercely amongst their legs. Finally Lee Wing tripped over Tim, and sat down abruptly, receiving as he did so an impassioned peck from Caesar which elicited from him a loud yell of anguish. Hogg, attempting to follow up his advantage, was checked suddenly by Jim, who left his parrot to its own devices, and arrived on the scene at full gallop. “You are a blessed pair of duffers!” said Jim wrathfully. “Look here, if father catches you fighting there’ll be the most awful row—and I’ll be in it too, what’s worse. Clear out, for goodness’ sake, before he comes along, and don’t get in each others’ road again!” and each nursing bitterness in his heart, the rival gardeners returned to their respective beds of roses and onions. Left to their own devices, the yellow cat and the cockatoo departed also, in a turmoil of wrath, with fur and feathers flying in equal proportions. Eventually Tim found discretion the better part of valour and scurried away to the safe shelter of the kitchen, pursued by Caesar with loud shrieks of defiance and victory—sounds of joyful triumph which lasted long after he had regained his perch and been securely fastened by the leg with his hated chain. Black Billy, meanwhile, had paid strict attention to business. The vagaries of wallabies and kangaroo, of cat and parrot and cockatoo, had no attraction for the dusky leader of the big black Orpington rooster. The Orpington—Jonah, Norah called him—was not inclined to race. He had tugged furiously at his leg rope, with much outcry and indignation, until Billy, finding himself alone, owing to the eccentric behaviour of the other starters, had resorted to different tactics by no means devoid of native cunning. Slackening the line, he suddenly produced from his pocket a few grains of wheat, and spread them temptingly before Jonah. Now Jonah was a tame bird. He was accustomed to being handled, and had only been indignant at the disgrace of bonds. This new departure was something he understood; so he gobbled up the wheat with alacrity and looked up inquiringly for more. “Right oh!” said Bffly, retiring a few steps down the track and bringing out another grain. Jonah sprang after it, and then was dazzled with the view of two lying yet a few yards farther off. So, feeding and coaxing, black Billy worked his unsuspecting steed across the little paddock. No one was near when he reached the winning post, to which he promptly tied Jonah, and, his purpose being accomplished, and no need of further bribery being necessary, sat down beside him and meditatively began to chew the remainder of his wheat. Jonah looked indignant, and poked round after more grains, an attention which Billy met with jeers and continued heartless mastication, until the Orpington gave up the quest in disgust, and retired to the limit of his tether. Billy sat quietly, with steadfast glittering eyes twinkling in his dusky face. “Hallo!” It was Jim’s voice. “Where are all the rest? D’you mean to say you’re the only one to get here?” Billy grinned silently. Sounds of mirth floated over the grass, and Norah, Harry and Wally raced up. “Where are your mokes?” queried Jim. “The good knights are dust, Their mokes are rust,” misquoted Wally cheerfully. “We don’t know, bless you. Cleared out, harness and all. We’ll have a wallaby and kangaroo hunt after this. Who’s won?” “Billy,” said Jim, indicating that sable hero. “In a common walk. Fed him over. All right, now, Billy, you catch-um kangaroo, wallaby—d’you hear?” Billy showed a set of amazingly white teeth in a broad grin, and departed swiftly and silently. “Where’s Lee Wing?” “Had to tear him off Hogg!” Jim grinned. “You never saw such a shindy. They’ve retired in bad order.” “Where’s Fudge?” “Left at the post!” “Where’s Mrs. Brown—and the tortoise?” “Great Scott!” Jim looked round blankly. “That never occurred to me. Where is she, I wonder?” The course was empty. “Tortoise got away with her!” laughed Wally. “H’m,” said Jim. “We’ll track her to her lair.” In her lair—the kitchen—Mrs. Brown was discovered, modestly hiding behind the door. The tortoise was on the table, apparently cheerful. “Poor dear pet!” said Mrs. Brown. “He wouldn’t run. I don’t think he was awake to the situation, Master Jim, dear, so I just carried him over—I didn’t think it mattered which way I ran—and my scones were in the oven! They’re just out—perhaps you’d all try them?”—this insinuatingly. “I don’t think this tortoise comes of a racing family!”—and the great menagerie race concluded happily in the kitchen in what Wally called “a hot buttered orgy.” CHAPTER IV. JIM’S IDEA Two hammocks, side by side, under a huge pine tree, swung lazily to and fro in the evening breeze. In them Norah and Harry rocked happily, too comfortable, as Norah said, to talk. They had all been out riding most of the day, and were happily tired. Tea had been discussed fully, and everything was exceedingly peaceful. Footsteps at racing speed sounded far off on the gravel of the front path—a wide sweep that ran round the broad lawn. There was a scatter of stones, and then a thud-thud over the grass to the pine trees—sounds that signalised the arrival of Jim and Wally, in much haste. Jim’s hurry was so excessive that he could not pull himself up in time to avoid Harry. He bumped violently into the hammock, with the natural result that Harry swung sharply against Norah, and for a moment things were rather mixed. “You duffer!” growled Harry, steadying his rocking bed. “Hurt you? “—this to Norah. “No, thanks,” Norah laughed. “What’s the matter with you two?” “Got an idea,” Wally gasped, fanning himself with a pine cone. “Hurt you?” “Rather. It’s always a shock for me to have an idea. Anyway this isn’t mine—it’s Jim’s.” “Oh.” Norah’s tone was more respectful. Jim’s ideas were not to be treated lightly as a rule. “Well, let’s hear it.” “Fishing,” Jim said laconically. “Let’s start out at the very daybreak, and get up the river to Anglers’ Bend. They say you can always get fish there. We’ll ride, and take Billy to carry the tucker and look for bait. Spend the whole blessed day, and come home with the mopokes. What do you chaps say?” “Grand idea!” Norah cried, giving her hammock an ecstatic swing. “We’ll have to fly round, though. Did you ask Dad?” “Yes, and he said we could go. It’s tucker that’s the trouble. I don’t know if we’re too late to arrange about any.” “Come and ask Mrs. Brown,” said Norah, flinging a pair of long black legs over the edge of the hammock. “She’ll fix us up if she can.” They tore off to the kitchen and arrived panting. Mrs. Brown was sitting in calm state on the kitchen verandah, and greeted them with a wide, expansive smile. Norah explained their need. Mrs. Brown pursed up her lips. “I haven’t anythink fancy, my dear,” she said slowly. “Only plum cake and scones, and there’s a nice cold tongue, and an apple pie. I’d like you to have tarts, but the fire’s out. Do you think you could manage?” Jim laughed. “I guess that’ll do, Mrs. Brown,” he said. “We’ll live like fighting cocks, and bring you home any amount of fish for breakfast. Don’t you worry about sandwiches, either—put in a loaf or two of bread, and a chunk of butter, and we’ll be right as rain.” “Then I’ll have it all packed for you first thing, Master Jim,” Mrs. Brown declared. “That’s ripping,” said the boys in a breath. “Come and find Billy.” Billy was dragged from the recesses of the stable. He grinned widely with joy at the prospect of the picnic. “All the ponies ready at five, Billy,” ordered Jim. “Yours too. We’re going to make a day of it—and we’ll want bait. Now, you chaps, come along and get lines and hooks ready!” “Whirr-r-r!” The alarm clock by Jim’s bedside shrieked suddenly in the first hint of daylight, and Jim sprang from his pillow with the alertness of a Jack-in-the-box, and grabbed the clock, to stop its further eloquence. He sat down on the edge of his bed, and yawned tremendously. At the other side of the room Harry slept peacefully. Nearer Wally’s black eyes twinkled for a moment, and hurriedly closed, apparently in deep slumber. He snored softly. “Fraud!” said Jim, with emphasis. He seized his pillow, and hurled it vigorously. It caught Wally on the face and stayed there, and beneath its shelter the victim still snored on serenely. Jim rose with deliberation and, seizing the bedclothes, gave a judicious pull, which ended in Wally’s suddenly finding himself on the floor. He clasped wildly at the blankets, but they were dragged from his reluctant grasp. Jim’s toe stirred him gently and at length he rose. “Beast!” he said miserably. “What on earth’s the good of getting up at this hour?” “Got to make an early start,” replied his host. “Come and stir up old Harry.” Harry was noted as a sleeper. Pillows hurled on top of him were as nought. The bedclothes were removed, but he turned on his side and slumbered like a little child. “And to think,” Wally said, “that that chap springs up madly when the getting-up bell rings once at school!” “School was never like this,” Jim grinned. “There’s the squirt, Wal.” The squirt was there; so was the jug of water, and a moment sufficed to charge the weapon. The nozzle was gently inserted into the sleeper’s pyjama collar, and in a moment the drenched and wrathful hero arose majestically from his watery pillow and, seizing his tormentors, banged their heads together with great effort. “You’re slow to wake, but no end of a terror when once you rouse up,” said Wally, ruefully rubbing his pate. “Goats!” said Harry briefly, rubbing his neck with a hard towel. “Come on and have a swim.” They tore down the hail, only pausing at Norah’s door while Jim ran in to wake her—a deed speedily accomplished by gently and firmly pressing a wet sponge upon her face. Then they raced to the lagoon, and in a few minutes were splashing and ducking in the water. They spent more time there than Jim had intended, their return being delayed by a spirited boat race between Harry’s slippers, conducted by Wally and Jim. By the time Harry had rescued his sopping footgear, the offenders were beyond pursuit in the middle of the lagoon, so he contented himself with annexing Jim’s slippers, in which he proudly returned to the house. Jim, arriving just too late to save his own, promptly “collared” those of Wally, leaving the last-named youth no alternative but to paddle home in the water-logged slippers—the ground being too rough and stony to admit of barefoot travelling. Norah, fresh from the bath, was prancing about the verandah in her kimono as the boys raced up to the house, her hair a dusky cloud about her face. “Not dressed?—you laziness!” Jim flung at her. “Well, you aren’t either,” was the merry retort. “No; but we’ve got no silly hair to brush!” “Pooh!—that won’t take me any time. Mrs. Brown’s up, Jim, and she says breakfast will be ready in ten minutes.” “Good old Brownie!” Jim ejaculated. “Can’t beat her, can you? D’you know if she’s got the swag packed?” “Everything’s packed, and she’s given it all to Billy, and it’s on old Polly by now.” Polly was the packhorse. “Such a jolly, big bundle—and everything covered over with cabbage leaves to keep it cool.” “Hooroo for Casey! Well, scurry and get dressed, old girl. I bet you keep us waiting at the last.” “I’m sure I won’t,” was the indignant answer, as Norah ran off through the hail. “Think of how much longer you take over your breakfast!” Ten minutes later breakfast smoked on the wide kitchen table, Mrs. Brown, like a presiding goddess, flourishing a big spoon by a frying-pan that sent up a savoury odour. “I’m sure I hope you’ll all kindly excuse having it in here,” she said in pained tones. “No use to think of those lazy hussies of girls having the breakfast-room ready at this hour. So I thought as how you wouldn’t mind.” “Mind!—not much, Mrs. Brown,” Jim laughed. “You’re too good to us altogether. Eggs and bacon! Well, you are a brick! of provisions from every part of the adjacent mainland. "Is it not a grand sight, Alfgar?" exclaimed his father. "Are you not proud of your people, the true monarchs of the sea?" Alfgar was for the moment inclined to sympathise; but he thought of the darker side of the picture, and was silent. There was a higher glory far than all this, and it had left a lifelong impression on his soul. CHAPTER X. CARISBROOKE IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY. The fleet bore the troops of savage soldiery safely--too safely--across the waters of the Solent, to the estuary formed by the Medina, where now thousands of visitors seek health and repose, and the towers of Osborne crown the eastern eminences. A fleet may still generally be discerned in its waters, but a fleet of pleasure yachts; far different were the vessels which then sought the shelter of the lovely harbour, beautiful even then in all the adornment of nature. There the Danes cast anchor, and the forces dispersed to their winter quarters. The king and his favourite chieftains took up their abode at Carisbrooke, situate about eight miles up the stream, but above the spot where it ceases to be navigable. Their chosen retreat was the precincts of the old castle--old even then--for it had been once a British stronghold, commanding the route of the Phoenician tin merchants across the island, whence its name "Caer brooke," or the "fort on the stream." The Romans in after ages saw the importance of the position, fortified it yet more strongly, and made it the chief military post of the island, which, under their protecting care, enjoyed singular peace and prosperity--civilisation flourished, arts and letters were cultivated. The beautiful coasts and inlets were crowded with villas, and invalids then, as now, sought the invigorating breezes, from all parts of the island of Britain, and even from the neighbouring province of Gaul. The Roman power fell at last, and when the English pirates, our own ancestors, like the Danes of our story, attacked the dismembered provinces of the empire, its wealth and position on the coast made it an early object of attack--happy those who fled early. The Anglo-Saxon chronicle shall tell the story of those who remained. "AD. 530. This year Cerdic and Cynric conquered the Isle of Wight, and slew many people at Whitgarasbyrg" (Carisbrooke). The conquering Cerdic died four years after, and his son Cynric gave the island to his nephews, Stuf and Wihtgar. The latter died in 544, and was buried in the spot he and his had reddened with blood, within the Roman ramparts of Carisbrooke. It is needless to say that at that early period our ancestors were heathens, and the mode of their conquest was precisely similar to that we are now describing under another heathen (with less excuse), Sweyn the son of Harold. It was a few days after the arrival of the Danes at their quarters, and Alfgar stood on the rampart at the close of a November day; it was St. Martin's Mass, as the festival was then called. The sun was sinking with fading splendour behind the lofty downs in the west, and casting his departing beams on the river, the estuary, with the fleet, and the blue hills of Hampshire in the far distance. Southward and westward the view was alike shut in by these lofty downs, and eastward the hills rose again, so as to enclose the valley, of which Carisbrooke formed the central feature. The ramparts whereon he was standing were of Roman workmanship, built so solidly that they had resisted every attack of man or of time; while down below lay the ruins of a magnificent villa, once occupied by the Roman governor of the island. Anlaf appeared and stood beside his son. "Alfgar," he said, "the day after tomorrow is the day of St. Brice." He paused and looked steadfastly in the face of his son. "And the king proposes to enrol you amongst his chosen warriors on that day; he has marked the skill you have displayed in the mimic contests with spear or sword, your skill as a horseman, and he wishes to see whether in actual battle you will fulfil the promise of the parade ground." "And yet he knows my faith." "Alfgar," said the old man solemnly, "you must renounce it or die; no mercy will be shown to a Christian on St. Brice's day; that is why the king has chosen it. Think, my son, over all I have told you; you will decide like one who yet controls his senses, and not disgrace your aged father." "Father, I do think of you," said the poor lad; "at least believe that. I do not grieve for myself. I feel I could easily die for my faith, but I do grieve over the pain I must cause you." The heart of the old warrior was sensibly affected by this appeal, but not knowing the strength of Christian principle, he could not reconcile it with facts, and he walked sadly away. But two days, and the dread choice had to be made--the crisis in the life of Alfgar, a crisis which has its parallel in the lives of many around us--approached, and he had to choose between Christ and Odin, between the death of the martyr and apostasy. He walked to and fro upon the ramparts, after his father left him, in the growing darkness, feebly illuminated by the light of a new moon. Below him, in the central area, a huge fire burned, whereat the evening meal was preparing for the royal banquet, for Sweyn and his ferocious chieftains were about to feast together. Escape was hopeless. Even had he not been bound by the promise given to his father, it would have been very difficult. He felt that his motions were watched. The island was full of foes, their fleet occupied the Solent. No; all that was left was to die with honour. But to bring such disgrace upon his father and his kindred! "Blood is thicker than water," says the old proverb, and Alfgar could not, even had he wished, ignore the ties of blood; nature pleaded too strongly. But there was a counter-motive even there--the dying wishes of his mother. If his father were Danish, she was both English and Christian. Before him the alternatives were sharply defined: Apostasy, and his ancestral honours, with all that the sword of the conqueror could give; and on the other hand, the martyr's lingering agony, but the hope of everlasting life after death. He could picture the probable scene. The furious king, the scorn of the companions with whom he had vied, nay, whom he had excelled, in the exercises of arms, end the ignominious death, perhaps that painful punishment known as the "spread eagle." No, they could not inflict that on one so nobly born, the descendant of princes. Alas! what might not Sweyn do in his wrath? Was Christianity worth the sacrifice? Where were the absolute proofs of its truth? If it were of God, why did He not protect His people? The heathen Saxons had been victorious over the Christian Britons; and now that they had become Christian, the heathen Danes were victorious over them. Was this likely to happen if Christ were really God? Again Odin and Frea, with their children, and the heroes sung by the scalds, in the war songs which he heard echoing from around the fire at that moment: "How this one was brave, And bartered his life For joy in the fight; How that one was wise, Was true to his friends And the dread of his foes." Valour, wisdom, fidelity, contempt of death, hatred of meanness and cowardice, qualities ever shining in the eyes of warlike youth. This creed had sufficed for his ancestors for generations, as his father had told him. Why should he be better than they? If they trusted to the faith of Odin, might not he? And then, if he lived, when the war was carried into Mercia, he would save his English friends, even although forced to live unknown to them. "Oh! life is sweet," thought he, "sweet to one so young as I. I have but tasted the cup; shall I throw it down not half empty?" He was almost conquered. He had all but turned to seek his father, when suddenly the remembrance of Bertric flashed vividly upon him. He saw, as in a vision, the patient, brave lad enduring mortal agony for Christ, so patiently, so calmly. Had Bertric, then, died for nought? He felt as if the martyr were near him, to aid him in this moment, when his faith was in peril. "O Bertric, Bertric!" he cried, "intercede for me, pray for me." He fell on his knees, and did not rise until the temptation was conquered, and then he walked steadily into the great vaulted room, of Roman construction, which served as the banqueting hall, and took his usual place by his father's side. Oh, how hollow the mirth and revelry that night! How he loathed the singing, the drunken shouting, the fierce imprecation over the wine cup--the sensuality, which now distinguished his bloodthirsty companions. The very knives he saw used for their meals had served as daggers to despatch the wounded or the helpless prisoner. The eyes, now weak with debauch, had glowed with the maniacal fury of the berserkir in the battlefield. Was this the glory of manhood? Nay, rather of wolves and bears. Then he looked up at Sweyn, the murderer of his father, and marvelled that his hand was yet so steady--his head so clear. This apostate parricide! never would he live to kiss the hand of such a man; better die at once, while yet pure from innocent blood. This his Christianity had taught him. "Minstrel," cried the fierce king, "sing us some stirring song of the days of old; plenty of the fire of the old Vikings in it." A strange minstrel, a young gleeman, had been admitted that night--one whose chain and robes bespoke him of the privileged class--and he sang in a voice which thrilled all the revellers into awed silence. He sang of the battle, of the joy of conquest, and the glories of Valhalla, where deceased warriors drank mead from the skulls of vanquished foes. And then he sang of the cold and snowy Niffelheim, where in regions of eternal frost the cowardly and guilty dead mourned their weak and wasted lives. In words of terrific force he painted their agony, where Hela, of horrid countenance, reigned supreme; where the palace was Anguish, Famine the board, Delay and Vain Hope the waiters, Precipice the threshold, and Leanness the bed. But in the innermost chamber of this awful home was the abode of Raging Despair; and in the final verse of his terrible ode the scald sang: "Listen to the ceaseless wail, Listen to the frenzied cry Of anguish, horror, and amaze; Would ye know from whom they come, Tell me, warriors, would ye know?" Here he paused, after throwing intense emphasis on the last words, till he had concentrated the attention of all, and the king gazed--absorbed--then he continued: "There wave on wave of bitter woe Overwhelms the parricide." The king started from his seat. He was about to launch his battle-axe through the air in search of the daring minstrel, when the same dread expression of unutterable agony we have before mentioned passed over his face; he trembled as an aspen, and sank, as one paralysed, into his chair, while his glaring eyes seemed to behold some horrid apparition unseen by all beside. The warriors now turned in their wrath to seek the daring or unfortunate minstrel, but he was gone. Alfgar had seen the apostate in his moment of retributive agony, and he shuddered. "Better death, far better," he murmured, "than a fate like this. God keep me firm to Him." The king had by this time recovered his usual composure, but his rage and fury were the more awful that the outbreak was suppressed. "Sit down, my warriors, disturb not the feast. What if your king has been insulted in his own banquet hall? there are hands enow to avenge him without unseemly tumult. Let us drink like the heroes in Valhalla. Meanwhile let the minstrel be sought and brought before us, and he shall make us sport in a different mode." The "rista oern" whispered one in his ear. The ferocious king nodded, and his eyes sparkled with the expected gratification of his fierce cruelty. Meanwhile warriors were searching all the precincts of the camp for the destined victim. Nearly half-an-hour had passed, and the king was getting impatient, for nearly all the chieftains were getting too drunk to appreciate the spectacle he designed for them. "Why do the men delay?" he cried; "let them bring in the minstrel." Still he came not; and at length the searchers were forced, one after the other, to confess their failure. "It is well," said the king; "but it was the insult of a Christian, and shall be washed out in Christian blood. Anlaf, produce thy son." "Nay, nay, not now," cried Sidroc and others, for they saw that Sweyn was already drunk, and consideration for Anlaf made them interfere. "Not now; tomorrow, tomorrow." "Nay, tonight, tonight." "Drink first, then, and drown care," said Sidroc, and gave the brutal tyrant a bowl of rich mead. He drank, drank until it was empty, then fell back and reposed with an idiotic smile superseding the ferocious expression his face had so lately worn. Meanwhile a hand was laid upon Alfgar's shoulder, and a keen bright eye met his own, as if to read his inmost thoughts. "Come with me, or my father will disgrace himself." It was Canute. He led Alfgar forth into the courtyard. "Thou dost not seem to fear death," said the boy prince. "It would be welcome now." "So some of our people sometimes say, but the motive is different; tell me what is the secret of this Christianity?" Just then Sidroc and Anlaf came out from the hall and saw the two together. Sidroc seemed annoyed, and led the young prince away, while Anlaf seized the opportunity to whisper to his son: "My son, I can do no more for thee; I see thou wilt persist in thine obstinacy. I release thee from thy promise given to me; escape if thou canst, or die in the attempt; but bring not my grey hairs to contempt on the morrow." At this moment, Sidroc having seen Canute to the royal quarters, returned. "Sidroc," said Anlaf, "I cannot any longer be the jailor of my unhappy and rebellious son. Let him be confined till the morrow. I shall ask leave of absence from Sweyn, and now I deliver Alfgar to your care." "I accept the charge," said Sidroc; "follow me, Alfgar, son of Anlaf." Alfgar followed passively. He could not help looking as if to take leave of his father; but Anlaf stood as mute and passionless as a statue. Sidroc reached a party of the guard, and bade them confine the prisoner in the dungeon beneath the ruined eastern tower. "Listen to my last words, thou recreant boy; Sweyn will send for thee early in the morning before the assembled host; it will be the day of St. Brice; and even were he not now mad with rage, there would be no mercy for a Christian on that day. Thou must yield, or die by the severest torture, compared with which the death of thy late companion under the archers' shafts was merciful. Be warned!" CHAPTER XI. THE GLEEMAN. It was a low dungeon, built of that brick which we still recognise as of Roman manufacture, in the foundations of what had been the eastern tower of the ancient fortification. The old pile had been badly preserved by the Saxon conquerors, but it had been built of that solid architecture which seems almost to defy the assaults of time, and which in some cases, after fifteen centuries, preserves all its characteristics, and promises yet to preserve them, when our frailer erections lie crumbled in the dust. The roof was semicircular, and composed of minute bricks, seeming to form one solid mass; the floor of tiling, arranged in patterns, which could still be obscurely traced by the light of the lamp left by the charity of Sidroc to the prisoner; for the dungeon was of bad reputation; lights had been seen there at unearthly hours, when the outer door was fast and no inmate existed. There were two long narrow windows at the end, unbarred, for they were too small for the human body to pass through them; they looked upon the valley and, river beneath, for although the dungeon was below the level of the courtyard, it was above that of the neighbourhood. The prisoner strode up and down the limited area, wrestling with self, bending the will by prayer to submit to ignominy and pain, for he knew now that his father had abandoned him, and that he had to apprehend the worst; still he did not regret the choice he had made, and he felt, as he prayed, peace and confidence descend like heavenly dew upon his soul. Mechanically he cast his eyes around the cell, and tried to trace out the pattern of the flooring, when he saw that the central figure, around which the circles and squares converged, was justice, with the scales, and the motto, "Fiat justitia." He knew the meaning of the words, for Father Cuthbert had taught him some Latin, and the conviction flashed upon him that, sooner or later, all the wrong and evil about him would be righted by the power of a judge as omnipotent as unerring. And this thought made him the more reconciled to the apparent injustice of which he was the victim, and he prayed for his father, that God would enlighten him with the true light. "Perhaps before he dies he may yet think of me without shame." For the shame which he unwillingly brought upon a father who was stern, yet not unkind or void of parental love, was the bitterest ingredient in the cup. And so the hours rolled on, which brought the dreaded morn nearer and nearer; and the victim, comforted by prayer, but without hope in this world, slept, and thought no longer of the torturer's knife, or felt the cruel anticipations which would rack the waiting mind. And while he slept he was wakened, yet but partly wakened, by a voice which seemed to belong to the borderland 'twixt sleep and waking. "Alfgar, son of Anlaf, sleepest thou?" "Surely I dream," thought he, and strove to sleep again. "Alfgar, son of Anlaf, sleepest thou?" Now he sat up, and beheld, or thought he beheld, a figure of one clothed in the attire of a minstrel, in the centre of the chamber. "Art thou yet in the flesh like me?" he cried, repressing a shudder. "Even so, a being of like mould, subject to pain and death." "A prisoner, then; art doomed to die?" "No prisoner, neither art thou, if thou willest to escape." "Thou art the gleeman who insulted Sweyn." "Nay, who told the brutal tyrant the truth." "And what doest thou here?" "I am come to deliver thee." "But how?" "Rise up, cast on your garments." Hardly knowing what he did, Alfgar obeyed, and when he stood face to face with the stranger, began to lose the uneasy impression that the being who addressed him was otherwise than mortal; for he saw by the light of the lamp that the gleeman bore all the attributes of a living man. "How came you here?" "Because I know the secrets of the prison house--knew them before the Danes had murdered the once happy dwellers in this garden of England, which they have made a howling wilderness; hence I escaped the wrath of the furious parricide, whom the saints destroy, with ease, and laughed in security at their vain efforts to take me; but we must waste no time; it yet wants five hours to daybreak; within those five hours we must reach the opposite shore." "But tell me, I cannot understand, why hast thou braved the wrath of Sweyn? why hast thou cared for me?" "All in good time, follow me now, I bid thee by the memory of Aescendune." "Aescendune! surely I dream." "Yes, of Aescendune. I have heard that thou art thence. Now waste no more time." More and more mystified, for he had never to his knowledge seen the speaker before, Alfgar gazed at the gleeman. He appeared of noble air and mien, but was evidently but a young man; he was somewhat above the average height, and looked as though he could wield the sword as well as the harp. But how were they to escape? Alfgar was not left long in doubt. The stranger took up the lamp and walked to the farthest recess of the dungeon, where, concealed amongst the rude carvings with which the builders had ornamented the wall, was a rose carved in stone. The gleeman pressed it sharply, and a hidden door sprang open, revealing a winding staircase excavated in the solid wall. "Upwards it leads to the banqueting hall, and you can comprehend my escape this evening," said he; "but our path is now downwards, unless you would like to go up and see the drunken beasts of murderers snoring off their debauch upon the floor as they fell; oh, that it were lawful for a Christian man to cut their throats as they lie; many innocent lives would be saved thereby, which those brutes will live to destroy." "Thou art, then, a Christian?" The gleeman crossed himself piously. "Why not?" said he. "I heard you sing like a scald tonight." "It was my part, and I acted it passing well, did I not? Sweyn would own as much; but, pardon me, I am forgetting that my daring put you in danger." "How did you know that?" "I heard every word; and perhaps I might even have risked more than this to save you." Meanwhile they had descended nearly a hundred steps, and the atmosphere became singularly cold and charnel-like, when they entered a large vault, which, by the light of their torches, appeared of great extent. Its walls were covered with uncouth representations, and inscriptions in Latin. "What place is this?" "It had some connection, I believe, with the old idolatry, and that is all I know. This passage will guide us to daylight and liberty." Following a short and narrow passage, they emerged upon a ruined vault, whose roof had fallen in. Climbing out with some difficulty, and disturbing in the process hundreds of bat-mice and not a few rats, they found themselves in the midst of some old ruins at the foot of the acclivity whereon the fortress was built, and below them the brook ran rapidly to join the river. "Thanks be to God for our preservation in that den of unclean lions!" said the gleeman; "but had they known who was amongst them, he would have had scant chance of escape." "May I not know?" "Not yet. Come, we must waste no more time." They walked swiftly down the brook. No sentinels were posted in this direction, nor was any lookout kept. "The danger is yet to come," said the gleeman, in a low tone. Shortly they reached the river, and then they found a boat hidden in the rushes, which grew tall and strong. They embarked, and Alfgar steered, by the other's direction, straight down the stream, while he rowed for full an hour with remarkable strength and dexterity, so that they drew near the coast, and the cold air from the sea blew in Alfgar's face. Here the gleeman ceased rowing, and spoke to him in a low tone. "Do you see those dark figures ahead?" "I do." "Well, they are the Danish war ships, and our hour of peril draws near. We must drop down with the tide, which is running out strongly, and I must steer. You can row, I suppose?" "Yes." "Well, get the oars ready to pull for your life, if I give the word, but not till then. Now silence." In perfect silence they drifted down upon the ships. Happily for them there was no moon, and although the stars were bright, there was little danger that their dark-painted bark would be seen at any distance. One great mass after another seemed to float by them; but it was the dead hour of the night, and no sounds were heard from the sleeping crews. They kept lax watch, because they had no foe to dread. There was, alas! no English fleet. One after another, until they had drifted into the centre of the fleet, where discovery must have been instant death. There above them rose the "Great Dragon," in all her hideous beauty, the gilded serpent reposing on the placid waves. Her people, even at that untimely hour, were engaged in revelry, and as they passed by the fugitives heard the words: "Now the warrior's cup of joy was full, When he drank the blood of his foe, Where the slain lay thick on the gory hill, And torrents of blood from every rill reddened the river below, For Odin's hall is the Northman's heaven--" But they heard no more, for they had drifted beyond hearing. They had now attained the last ship, when suddenly a watchman sprang to the side. "Boat ahoy! Whence and where?" "From the 'Great Dragon'--a poor gleeman and his attendant to his home on the shore." "Come on board then, and wake us with a song. The watch is ours, and we will make it merry." There was no help for it; and commending courage with a significant look to his companion, the gleeman and Alfgar ascended. It was yet dark, and the language and appearance of each might pass tolerably under ordinary circumstances for the characters they had assumed. "Now a song, and we will keep it up till daylight." Thus pressed, the gleeman took his harp and sang an old Scandinavian song of the first sea king who invaded England, Ragnar Lodbrok. He told how the fierce Ragnar sailed for England, how his fleet was wrecked, but still how, with the relics of his forces, he assaulted Northumbria, and was taken captive by Ella the king, who threw him into a hole filled with vipers and toads. "Sharp the adder's tooth, but sharper Spake the sea king to his foes, Spake while savage brows grew darker, As he told the countless woes Which the bear's fierce cubs should bring To those who slew their father and their king." Then he described the retribution, and the lingering death of Ella under the agonies of the "rista oern" so vividly, that every Danish heart was filled with emulation. "Well sung!" shouted the Danes. "Thou dost sing a song worth hearing. Hast not taught thy son to sing likewise?" In turn Alfgar was forced to support his assumed character. Luckily his tenacious memory retained the words of many an old song, and the warriors were well pleased. "Why must thou go to shore? We will feed and guerdon thee well if thou wilt stay with us." "We are aweary now, and would fain return to our comrades on the shore, but we will return by and by." "Do so, here is thy reward;" and one of the speakers threw a gold chain round the gleeman's neck. Gold was plentiful with the robbers. They were allowed to return to their boat; but as they did so, many a keen eye was fixed upon them. The dawn was already beginning to appear in the east, and every moment was of importance. "Thou hast borne the test well," said the gleeman, "and hast not flinched." "I could not in your presence." At this moment they heard the rapid splash of a boat, manned by many rowers, behind, and a voice shouted aloud to the men on board the ship they had left: "Hast seen a boat with a gleeman and harp bearer?" "They have just left the ship." "Follow; they are English spies. Sweyn will give the weight of their heads in red gold." Instantly they heard the sound of hurried voices, the lowering of boats, the splash of numerous oars, and all nearly close behind them. They took an oar each, and pulled with all the energy of men who pull for life or death. The light was gradually growing stronger, and their chance of escape seemed feeble, when Alfgar saw before them a dense cloud of mist rolling round the eastern promontory, and uttered a cry of joy as it enfolded them. "The wind is east, keep it on your right cheek, and steer straight forward. I will take both oars," said the gleeman. It was wonderful with what energetic force and success the gleeman pulled until they had cleared the mist, and saw that they were in the red light of dawn, in the midst of the Solent. One half-mile behind them a solitary boat pursued. There appeared to be only five men, four rowing and one steering. Other boats there were, but wide of the mark. "Alfgar," said the gleeman, "you will find a quiver of arrows and a long bow at the bottom of the boat behind you." Alfgar handed them to him. "The points are passing sharp, and the bow is in order; take your turn to row." Alfgar obeyed; he could not do otherwise, the gleeman's tone of command was so powerful, but he feared they would loss time by the change. "You need not hurry yourself; let them approach. They are not likely to have brought other weapons than their swords and axes." The boat gained on them rapidly, until it was within a hundred and fifty yards. "Keep just this distance if you can," said the gleeman, and drew an arrow suddenly to its head; it whistled through the air, and the steersman, transfixed, rose, leapt in the boat, and fell in the sea a corpse. "Gone to seek oysters for King Sweyn's table, I suppose," said the gleeman. Another steersman promptly took the place, but some yards were lost by the pursuers. "Slacken, we are too far for accurate aim; and we English must not disgrace ourselves in Danish eyes." They slackened, another arrow sped, and the foremost rower fell. Evidently the Danes had no means of reply. "Slacken yet more;" and before the pursuers could recover their confusion, a third fell, then a fourth, before the unerring shafts. The fifth was at the fearful gleeman's mercy, but he restrained himself, now danger had vanished. But as he did so he cried aloud: "Dane, we give thee thy life, blood sucker though thou art. Go, and tell King Sweyn that Edmund {viii} the Etheling, son of Ethelred of England, has been his gleeman, and hopes he enjoyed the song which told the doom of parricides." CHAPTER XII. THE MONASTERY OF ABINGDON. One of the central lights of civilisation and Christianity in the early days of Wessex was the monastery of Abingdon. St. Birinus had fixed the centre of his missionary labours at Dorchester, only six miles distant, but the Abbey was the fruit of the heroic zeal of another evangelist, upon whom his mantle fell--St. Wilfrid. After the death of Birinus, the zeal of his successors failed to evangelise the southeastern districts of Wessex, until, at length, came Wilfrid, fervent in zeal, and, stationing himself at Selsey, near Chichester, evangelised both Sussex and Wessex, sending out missionaries like-minded with himself, even into the most inaccessible wilds. Centwin was then king of Sussex, but various petty states were tributary to him, and ruled by viceroys. One of these viceroys was Cissa, whose dominions included Wiltshire and the greater part of Berkshire {ix}. This Cissa and his nephew, Hean, founded Abingdon. A mission was sent out from Chichester which attracted great multitudes of the Berkshire folk. Hean was present, and heard the preacher take for his text that verse of St. Matthew which declares that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. These words entered into the hearts of Hean and his sister Cilla, who was with him. They determined to go and sell all that they had and embrace a life of poverty. From their uncle, Cissa, they obtained grants of land, whereon they founded monastic homes. Cilla dedicated the convent she reared to St. Helena, the mother of Constantine, traditions of whose life in the neighbourhood had survived the Saxon Conquest. Hean obtained the land of which Abingdon formed the central point, then generally known by the name Cloveshoo. He was tardy in his work as contrasted with his sister, and Cissa died without seeing the work for which he had given the land accomplished. Ceadwalla succeeded him (A.D. 685), and further augmented the territory. He rebelled against Centwin, and became king of Wessex; spending most of his life in warfare; it was through his conquest of the island that the "Wight" became Christian. He made a pilgrimage to Rome, where he died, after his baptism by Pope Sergius. Ina, his successor (A.D. 688), was so angry at the long delay in building the monastery, that at first he revoked the grant of his predecessors to Hean, but becoming reconciled, gave all his energy to the work, and Cloveshoo {x}, or Abingdon, became a monastic town, and its history commences as a house of God from Ina, about A.D. 690-700. Important benefits were thus conferred on the whole neighbourhood; agriculture flourished, learning increased, a sanctuary for the oppressed was provided, and last, though not least in Ina's eyes, a bulwark against Mercia was provided for the neighbourhood; while the poor and the afflicted found their happiness in every way promoted by the neighbourhood of the monastery. Several times the monastery was in peril by reason of the wars between Wessex and Mercia. In A. D. 752, Cuthred of Wessex defeated Ethelbald of Mercia at Burford, hard by, and protected Abingdon from further aggressions. Twenty-five years later the decision of war was reversed. Offa, the great and fierce king of Mercia, defeated Cynewulf of Wessex, at Bensington, and spoiled the land, destroying the convent of St. Helena, founded by Cilla, and grievously robbing and oppressing Abingdon. But the most awful calamity it ever underwent was its destruction in the first great Danish invasion, in the early days of King Alfred, when it was literally levelled with the ground, only, however, to arise in greater magnificence when the storm had passed away. However the period of anarchy had introduced evils which required a stern reformer, and one was found in the person of the abbot Ethelwold, the friend of St. Dunstan, who, in conjunction with him and Oswald, introduced the rule of St. Benedict into Abingdon, Glastonbury, Ely, and other great houses, which, by its absolute prohibition of monastic idleness, and its wise regulations, caused the religious houses of that period to become the central points of civilisation and learning in the land. Here, at this famous monastery, we resume Father Cuthbert's Diary. In festo St. Edmundi. Again I resume my diary, at the great monastic house of Abingdon, where I have rejoined my brethren. I have already told how, in company with Elfwyn, Father Adhelm and I sought the forest farm where our beloved ones had found refuge from the cruel oppressor. The joy of the women and children to whom their husbands and fathers were thus restored was very touching; all seemed willing to forget the destruction of their homes, since they had been spared to each other, and I, to whom, by my vows, such love is unknown, yet could but feel how holy a thing is family affection. Alas, there was one family where the bitterness of death had found its way. I cannot describe the touching scene when Elfwyn told the fate of dear Bertric. Well, they will learn by and by to thank God for him and his example, for we doubt not he died a martyr, although we know not the details, and, unless Alfgar yet lives, shall perhaps never know them. We held a long consultation upon our future movements. It was wisely decided not to rebuild Aescendune at present, for the place where they now are can be rendered very commodious, and is far more secure against a foe. We do not dare to hope that we have seen the last of our troubles; the Danes are wintering in the Wight, ready for fresh mischief next spring and summer. We have been able to learn nothing of Alfgar; but we think that Anlaf probably yet lives, and that he has recovered his son; yet we cannot imagine how he escaped on St. Brice's night. Well, to return. We at once set to work, and erected a church of timber, for the service of God; and I said mass in it the first Sunday after our arrival there. It may be supposed it is not a very grand church; but God looks at the living stones, and reads the heart. We all had enough to do for the first few days; but within a week one might suppose we had been living there an age. Log huts were erected for the whole population; the old farm house, which is large and strongly built, taking the place of the hall. One must dispense with some comfort now. My brother sent a portion of his men to rejoin the army, but feels himself justified in entering at once on his winter quarters with the remainder; in fact, since my arrival at Abingdon, the troops have all been dismissed for the winter, and the Danes have, as I said, retired to the Wight. Then, leaving Father Adhelm in charge of the woodland settlement, I determined to visit my brethren here, where I have been received with all Christian love and hospitality by the abbot and his brethren. Three days my journey lasted. I travelled with only two attendants, serfs of our house; a poor prior burnt out from house and home. Nov. 21st, 1006.-- This evening I heard heavy steps on the stairs, and methought their tread seemed familiar, as well it might, for no sooner had the door opened than my son Alfgar, for whom we had mourned as dead, or at least dead to us, fell upon my neck and wept. It was a long time before either of us was composed enough to say much, but when we had a little recovered, the abbot who had brought them to my rooms introduced a tall young man in gleeman's garb, as Edmund the Etheling. At length we all sat down to supper, but talked so much we could eat little, and I soon learned all the news Alfgar had to tell. His tale is wonderful; he has been indeed delivered from the mouth of the lion, nay, from the jaws of the fierce lion; but I must set down all things in order. The one thing which delights me most is the way in which his faith has stood the hard hard test to which it has been put. But my dear nephew Bertric, Saint Bertric we must assuredly call him, oh how it will lighten the grief of his parents and sister to know how gloriously he died for Christ! One could envy him his crown. And then how delighted Ethelgiva will be to learn not only that Alfgar is alive, but to hear how true and brave he has been. But when all these congratulations were over, and we had learned all that Alfgar had to tell, there was evidently something on the mind of the prince. "Alfgar and I have a very important duty to perform," he said. I waited, and he proceeded. "There has been grievous treachery in our ranks. Edric Streorn has sold us to the Danes." "I feared as much," said I, sadly. "I learned it at Carisbrooke, and am now on my way to Dorchester, where my royal father has arrived, or will arrive tomorrow. I should have gone there at once, but Alfgar learned you were here, and would come. Besides, we need your help to fit us for appearing at court." And, in truth, their habiliments were not very royal. Well, Abingdon is a town of great resources, wherein all things meet may be found. "We will to the tradesmen tomorrow," I said, "and fit you for the presence." "I have yet heavier news to unfold," Edmund added, very seriously. "The Danes purpose a winter campaign in the heart of the land, hoping to take us unawares." "Now the saints forbid!" said I. "Even so; but they are not all with us. St. Brice is against us." I sighed, and so did they. The very remembrance of that day is sickening. "We have heard," said the abbot, "that the king will arrive tomorrow at Dorchester; we will send you thither in the morning. Meanwhile, my sons, you do not eat and drink as I would have you. Remember you need to sustain exhausted nature." That was indeed true. They had travelled fast, and had fasted by the way, of necessity. "Well, Alfgar, we will tomorrow to the king," said Edmund, after they had eaten and drunken; "he must surely listen to us now." "He appears to love this wicked Edric," said the abbot sorrowfully. "Far better than his own flesh and blood," replied Edmund. "My son," said the abbot, "rest here this night in our poor house; tomorrow we will find you both horses and fitting apparel, and ye shall go meetly to the king, who is the guest of the bishop." "I shall not be sorry, father, to see the inside of my chamber," said the young prince; for he is yet young, although so wise and valiant--not more than a year or two older than Alfgar. The compline bell rang. "I will go with you to thank God first for our deliverance, and to pay my vows to Him," said Edmund; "then to bed." After compline, Edmund went from the chapel to bed. Alfgar would not retire. He came to my cell; there he talked with me for a full hour. His affection moves me greatly. He has evidently found a real friend in Prince Edmund, who has delivered him from a cruel death, and who wants to attach him permanently to his service. Meanwhile Alfgar is all haste to return to Aescendune and Ethelgiva, before any further steps are taken. Saturday, Nov. 22d, 1006.-- After we had arrayed the Etheling and Alfgar this morning, I decided to accompany them on their road to Dorchester, for it happened that I had arranged to say mass and preach tomorrow at the little church of St. Michael at Clifton, the residence of my sister Bertha and her husband Herstan. It lies on a cliff over the Thames, on the way to the cathedral city, whence its name, "the town on the cliff." So we started, the Etheling, Alfgar, and I, after the chapter mass at nine. We crossed the fine timber bridge over the Isis, then kept the causeway over the marshes, till, crossing an arm of the main stream, we ascended a hill and passed through the open country. On the north the country is richly wooded. There lies the chase of Neweham, abounding in deer, with a few wolves yet lingering in its recesses, and forming sport for the ceorls. In the neighbourhood of a great monastery the roads are always good, and waggons can travel easily and smoothly from Abingdon to Dorchester. So, being well mounted, we were only the best part of an hour in reaching Clifton. The river here makes a sudden bend to the east, after running for some time almost due north, and at the bend the steep cliff rises whereon the little church and my brother Herstan's hall is built, with a few cottages below and around occupied by his theows. We went first to the church and offered our devotions. From the elevated ground whereon it stands, the cathedral of Dorchester and the Synodune hills formed conspicuous objects. Then we turned to the hall, and met a reception such as warmed the heart. When we had refreshed ourselves, I had to tell Bertha all the strange events which have recently happened at Aescendune; of the destruction of her old home, but of the well being of all her friends; yes, of all, for we know that he has won the martyr's crown. Some natural tears she dropped; but I think she soon came to see all things in their right light, as we try to do. Soon after our arrival, Herstan sent a messenger to Dorchester to learn at what hour the king was expected; and the answer was returned, that they expected him in time for the banquet at the episcopal palace this evening. So Edmund and Alfgar consented to pass the day quietly at Cliffton. CHAPTER XIII. THE CITY OF DORCHESTER. Dorchester was at this period the most important city of the Midland counties, for it was the seat of the great bishopric which extended its sway over nearly the whole of Mercia. Here the apostle of Wessex, Birinus, had converted and baptized Cynegils, king of that country, Oswald, the saintly king of Northumbria, being present, and receiving him fresh from the regenerating waters as his adopted son. Here, the next year, Cuichelm, his brother, was baptized, and from this centre Christianity was widely diffused. The good bishop died in the year 650, and was buried amongst the people he loved, but many years later his relics were translated to Winchester. But the tale went forth that the cunning canons of Dorchester had given them another body than that of the saint, and their shrine was the object of veneration equally with the rival shrine at Winchester. Dorchester became successively the seat of two great bishoprics--the one West Saxon, the other Mercian. The first, founded by Birinus, when Wessex extended far north of the Thames, was divided seventy years later into two sees--Winchester and Sherburne. For some years the city was without bishops, owing to its insecure position during the strife between Wessex and Mercia, but later it appears as the seat of the great Mercian bishopric, retaining its jurisdiction until after the Norman conquest, when the see was transferred to Lincoln. Therefore Dorchester long enjoyed a wide celebrity and greater influence, than the city, Oxenford, which, lying at a distance of ten miles, was destined to supersede it eventually. The day was closing on an evening of November 1006, and the sun was sinking across the level country beyond the walls, when the people of Dorchester might have been seen crowding the roads which led from the eastern gate towards Bensington and Wallingford; the wooden bridge by which the road crossed the Tame was covered with human beings, and every eye was eagerly directed along the great high road. The huge cathedral church towered above the masses, rude in architecture, yet still impressive in its proportions, while another church, scarcely smaller in its dimensions, rose from the banks lower down the stream, below the bridge, and the wooden steeple of a third was visible above the roofs of the houses in the western part of the city. But, as in every other city which had once been Roman, the relics of departed greatness contrasted painfully (at least we should think so) with the humbler architecture around. The majesty of the churches was indeed (as a contemporary wrote) great, but thatched roofs consorted ill with the remains of shattered column and pedestal, and with the fragmentary ruins of the grand amphitheatre, which were yet partly visible, although the stones which had been brought from Bath to build it had been employed largely in church architecture. The light of day was rapidly fading; a light breeze brought down the remaining leaves from the trees, or whirled them about in all directions; winter was plainly about to assume the mastery of the scene, as was evident from the clothing the people wore, the thick fur and warm woollen cloaks which covered their light tunics. At length the sound of approaching cavalry was heard, and the cry "The King! the King!" was raised, and cheers were given by the multitude. It was observable, almost at a glance, that they proceeded from the young and giddy, and that their elders refrained from joining in the cry. About a hundred horsemen, gaily caparisoned, appeared, and in the midst, with equal numbers of his guard preceding and following, rode Ethelred the king. He was of middle stature and not uncomely, but there was a look of vacillation about his face, which would have struck even an indifferent physiognomist, while his thin lips, which he was constantly biting (when he was not biting his nails), seemed to indicate a tendency towards cruelty. But by his side rode one, whose restless eyes seemed to wander to each individual of the crowd in turn, while power and malice seemed equally conspicuous in his glance. Little changed since we last beheld him rode the traitor, for so all but the king accounted him, Edric Streorn. Amidst the shouts of the populace, who loved to look on the display, the Bishop Ednoth {xi} and the chief magistrates of the city received the monarch and his councillor in front of the church of Sts. Peter and Paul, and escorted him through the streets to the palace, which stood in what was then a central position, on the spot now called Bishop's Court. It was spacious, built around a quadrangular courtyard, with cloisters surrounding the lowest storey and the smooth shaven lawn, in the centre of which a granite cross was upraised. A gateway opened in the southern side and led to the inner court, and the cloisters opened from either side upon it. On the opposite side of the quadrangle was the great hall where synods were held, and where, on state occasions, such as a royal visit, the banquet was prepared. Here, after the king had availed himself of the bath, and his attendants had divested themselves of their travel-stained attire, the throne of the king was placed at the head of the board, and a seat for the bishop on his right hand, and for Edric on his left. Ethelred took his place; upon his head a thin circlet of gold confined his flowing locks already becoming scant, but, as their natural colour was light, not otherwise showing signs of age: he was only in his fortieth year. His tunic was finely embroidered in colours around the neck, and was below of spotless white, secured by a belt richly gilded, whereon was a sheath for the dagger or knife, which was used for all occasions, whether in battle or in meal time, the haft being inlaid with precious stones. Over the tunic a rich purple mantle was lightly thrown, and his slippers were of dark cloth, relieved by white wool; the tunic descended to his heels. The attire of Edric was similar in shape, but of different colour; his tunic was of green, edged with brown fur, his mantle of dark cloth, and his belt of embossed leather. There was a studied humility in it all, as if he shunned all comparison with the king. Ednoth said grace, and the chanters responded. The canons of the cathedral, the priests of the other churches, the sheriff of the county, the reeve of the borough, the burgesses, all had their places, and the banquet began; huge joints being carried round to each individual, from which, with his dagger, he cut what he fancied and deposited it on his plate; then wine, ale, and mead were poured foaming into metal tankards, and lighter delicacies followed. There was no delay; no one cared to talk until he had satisfied his appetite. The king, as a matter of course, opened the conversation, when the edge of desire was gone. "Have the levies who served in the war all been disbanded, Sheriff?" "The last returned from the garrisons in Sussex a week ago, and are all hoping for a quiet winter in the bosom of their families." "Have they lost many of their number? Did the people of this hundred suffer greatly in the war which Sweyn forced upon us?" "Not very many; still there has been a little mourning, and much anticipation of future evil," replied the bishop. "That is needless," said Edric; "they may all prepare to keep their Christmas with good cheer. The Danes are sleeping, hibernating like bears in their winter caves." "While they are so near as the Wight, who can rest in peace?" said Ednoth. "The Wight! it must be a hundred miles from here; the Danes have never reached any spot so far from the coast as this." "Yet there is an uneasy belief that they will attack the inland districts now that they have exhausted the districts on the coast, and that we must be prepared to suffer as our brethren have done." "Before they leave their retreat again we shall be ready to meet them; our levies will be better trained and more numerous." "A curse seemed upon all our exertions this last year," said Ednoth, sorrowfully. "We were defending our hearths and our homes, yet we were everywhere outmanoeuvred and beaten. It could not have been worse had we had spies and traitors in command." The king slightly coloured, for he resented all imputations on his favourite, and was about to make a sharp reply, when a voice which made him start, replied: "Quite right, reverend father! as you say, success was impossible while spies and traitors commanded our forces." All looked up in amazement; two guests had entered unbidden, and the king, the bishop, and Edric recognised Prince Edmund. "The unseemly interruption is a sufficient introduction to the company. I need not, my friends, present to you my turbulent son Edmund, or the attendant he has picked up." "No need whatsoever, if you will first allow us to explain the reasons of our presence here. We have somewhat startling news from the enemy." "The enemy, by my last advices, lies quiet in the Isle of Wight," said Edric. "I will not dispute your knowledge, my lord Edric," replied the Prince, "considering the intimacy you stand on with Sweyn." "Intimacy! I would sooner own intimacy with the Evil One." "You might own that, too, without much exaggeration, since the good bishop will bear me witness that he is the father of lies." "Edmund, this is unbearable," said the king. "Pardon, my father and liege, but truth will out." The company sat in amazement, while the hand of Edric played convulsively with the hilt of his dagger; meanwhile Edmund ate, and gave to Alfgar, ere he spake again. "Stay, Edric," whispered the king; "thou art my Edric. I was never false to thee, nor will I be now; did I not, for thy sake, look over the death of Elfhelm of Shrewsbury, and put out the eyes of his sons? canst thou not trust me now?" Thus strengthened, Edric remained, and uneasy whispers passed around the assembly. At last Edmund looked up. "When the flesh is weak through toil and fasting, speech is not eloquent, but now listen, all Englishmen true, and I will speak out." He told his tale, how he had conceived suspicions that the Danes intended a winter descent; how he had risked his life (in the exuberance of youthful daring) to ascertain the truth; how, trusting to his knowledge of Carisbrooke, wherein he had spent many pleasant days in his boyhood, he had ventured amongst the Danes as a gleeman, in imitation of Alfred of old; how there he had assisted, unsuspected, at a meeting of the council in the great hall, and heard it decided to invade England, and finally how he had escaped. And then he continued: "And in that council I heard that the Danes had a secret friend in the English army, who ever gave them due warning of our movements, and who caused all the miscarriage of our last campaign. Stand forth, Edric Streorn, for thou art the man, and my sword shall prove it, if need be." "Edmund, thou ravest," cried the king; "produce thy witnesses." "Alfgar, son of Anlaf, answer; whom didst thou espy talking with Sweyn?" "Edric Streorn." "How didst know him?" "Because he threatened my life on St. Brice's night, and I had often seen him while dwelling in Mercia." "A Dane witnessing against a free-born Englishman? Can it be endured?" cried Ethelred. "What, here, my royal guard!--here! here! your King is insulted--insulted, and by his son and his son's minions." The guard rushed in, their weapons in their hands. "Seize my son, the false Edmund." "Here I am," quietly said the hero of the English army, for such he was, although not recognised as such by the government of his father. "Here I am; what Englishman will bind me?" The men stood as if paralysed. "Will you not obey?" shouted the weak Ethelred, and stamped in impotent anger on the floor. But they would not--they could not touch Edmund. Edric whispered in the king's ear. "I was wrong," said the king; "retire, guards. "Edmund, come with me; tell me what you have seen. I will hear you, and judge between you and my Edric--judge fairly." "Wait till my return, Alfgar." Alfgar waited. No one spoke to him; all the company seemed utterly bewildered, as well they might be until, after the expiration of an hour, during which time Ednoth had left the hall, and the company broke up by degrees, an officer of the court came and whispered in his ear that Edmund awaited him without the gates. He left the table at once, and proceeded beyond the precincts of the palace, following his guide. "Where is the prince?" "He has had a stormy interview with his father, and has just left him, refusing to lodge in the palace, to sleep without the precincts. I am to conduct you thither." Leaving the palace, they were passing through some thick shrubbery, when all at once two strong men sprang upon Alfgar. At the same moment his attendant turned round and assisted his foes. He struggled, but he was easily overpowered, when his captors led him away, until, passing a postern gate in the western wall of the town, they crossed an embankment, and came upon the river. There they placed him on board a small boat, and rowed rapidly down the stream. In the space of a few minutes they ran the boat ashore in the midst of dense woods which fringed the farther bank, and there they forced him to land, and led him upwards until, deep in the woods, they came upon an old timbered house. They knocked at the door, which was speedily opened by a man of gigantic stature and ruffianly countenance, by whose side snarled a mastiff as repulsive as he. "Here, Higbald, we have brought thee a prisoner from our lord." The wretch looked upon Alfgar with the eyes of an ogre bent on devouring a captive, and then said: "The chamber where blind Cuthred was slaughtered looks out on the woods behind where no one passes, and it is strong; it will be better for you that you were in great danger, the experience is one that I might meet at any time. I am not seriously hurt; a cut or two; no bones broken. I have come off well. Pray do not distress yourself on my account. My sole concern is for you.” “Shall we try to get across now? It must be very late.” “I think it is, and growing cloudier all the time. Did you say the boat was this way? Sit still. Please do not make any more effort than you need. Those little feet have been too sorely tried already.” The boat was found in its place, and they embarked upon the little creek, by degrees making their way around the island, and then across to the opposite shore. “I trust it is not far, for your sake,” said Mr. Baldwin, seeing how utterly exhausted the girl was. “No, it is but a little way.” Yet every step was torture to the already bruised feet, and tears were running down the girl’s cheeks when at last they stopped at the door of old Hagar’s little hut. Mr. Baldwin rapped sharply. “Who dar?” came a startled response. “It is I, Aunt Hagar; Lettice, Mars Jeems’s Lettice.” [Illustration: “_What yuh doin’ hyar dis time o’ night?_”] “Law, chile! Fo’ de Lawd!” came the reply, and in an instant there was a withdrawal of bolts and bars, and the old woman’s head was thrust out. “What yuh doin’ hyar dis time o’ night, honey chile?” she asked, peering out into the darkness. “Huccome yuh lookin’ up ole Hagar? I specs yuh in lub,” she chuckled; but when Lettice and her companion stepped into the cabin and Aunt Hagar had struck a light, she looked at the two in astonishment. “Law, chile,” she exclaimed, “yuh look lak ole rag-bag. What got yuh? Mos’ bar’ footy, an’ all yo’ clo’es tattered an’ to’n; an’ who dis?” She peered up into Mr. Baldwin’s face. “I knows him. He one o’ de Bald’in tribe. Dat a Bald’in nose. I know dat ef I see it in Jericho. What yuh doin’ wif mah young miss out in de worl’ dis time o’ night?” she asked suspiciously. “We were at Uncle Tom’s, and were attacked by a party of Britishers on our way home,” Lettice told her. “Some o’ dat mizzible gang from Kent Island, I reckons.” “Yes, we suppose so. Well, we had a desperate time getting away from them. Mr. Baldwin fought--oh, how he fought!” “And you, Miss Hopkins, how well you did your part.” “It was life or death, and we at last did escape, but we have lost our horses, and are too footsore and bruised and scared to go farther.” “Ole Hagar fix yuh up. I has ’intment, yuh knows I has; an’ I has yarbs; but, fo’ de Lawd, I’ll cunjur dem Britishers, ef dey is a way to do it, dat I will. Dere now, honey, let me wrop up dem po’ litty footies. Hm! Hm! dey is stone bruise, an’ dey is scratch, an’ dey is strain an’ sprain, an’ what ain’ dey? But dis cyo’ ’em. Now lemme see what young marster a-needin’. Hm! Hm! he slash an’ slit; swo’d cut on he shoulder. Huccome he fight an’ swim an’ row, I dunno, wif all dese yer slashes, an’ t’ars, an’ all dat. Yuh bofe has sholy been froo de mill. I say yuh has.” And talking all the time, the old woman managed to make her visitors really comfortable, as she ministered to them with deft, experienced fingers. “Now, Aunt Hagar,” said Mr. Baldwin, when she had put on her last bandage, “I will leave Miss Lettice in your care, and I will go to her home and report that she is safe. They will be very anxious.” “Oh, but you are not fit to go any farther,” Lettice protested. “Oh, yes, I am. You do not know what a charm Aunt Hagar has put into these ointments. Your family will be in great distress of mind, and I think it would be best that I should go and reassure them.” “Yes, honey, he better go,” said Aunt Hagar, from the corner where she was busying herself with some mysterious mixture. “Mars Bald’in, drink dis, honey, hit give yuh stren’th, an’ mek yuh git over de groun’ lak a rabbit. Jess follow de paf to de spring, den strike off to de lef’, an’ whenst yuh come to de hayricks by de right side de road, yuh is jes back o’ Mars William’s barn. Hit a roun’erbout way, but hit’s better dan crossin’ de water. I’ll look out fo’ Miss Letty. Yuh tell ’em Aunt Hagar got her, an’ dey satify she all right. An’ tell ’em,” she went to the door and spoke in a whisper, “tell ’em not to raise a cry all roun’ de neighborhood dat she out dis-a-way. Dey is folks dat love to talk, an’ I don’ want de chile’s name to be made free wif, an’ have ’em say she traipsin roun’ de country wif young men all hours of de night. Yuh hyar me?” “I agree with you, certainly, Aunt Hagar, and I shall do my part in keeping the matter quiet. A young lady’s name is too delicate a thing to be bandied about by those who are merely curious. I will see you again soon, Aunt Hagar. I haven’t thanked you half as I should for your kindness.” Aunt Hagar beamed, and as she reëntered the room and stood over Lettice, where she sat in a low splint-bottomed chair, she said: “He blue blood. I knows dat. Some folkses has money but dey hasn’t nothin’ e’s. He got de name an’ de manners of a gent’man.” She stroked Lettice’s hair with her withered old hand. “Now, honey,” she went on, “I gwine give yuh a drink o’ sumpin’ to put yuh to sleep, an’ yuh ain’ gwine wake up no mo’ twel de sun three hours high; an’ I gwine put a name in dis cup so yuh dreams gwine be sweet an’ pleasant. Yuh is had a bad ’sperience, an’ yuh might have turr’ble dreams ef yuh didn’t have no chawm ter stop ’em. Drink dis, honey, hit tas’ es sweet an’ good, an’ won’ hu’t a kitten. I mek yo’ baid up nice an’ clean, an’ yuh sleep lak a baby.” “But where will you sleep?” Lettice asked. “I sleep whar I sleep. Yuh reckon I uses dat baid? I sleeps whar I sleeps; in dis cheer, on de flo’, anywhar I lak. Yuh don’ reckon I sleeps in dat baid dese hot nights? No, ma’am, I sleeps whar I sleeps.” And despite Lettice’s protests she would have her take possession of the high four-posted bed with its bright patchwork quilt, and its fresh white sheets; and in a few minutes the exhausted girl was fast asleep. She awakened the next morning to hear the patter of rain on the roof, and to see Aunt Hagar crouching over a fire, giving her attention to a fine pone browning in the bake kettle. There was an odor of sizzling bacon, of coffee, and of some herby mess which Lettice could not identify. She sat up in bed, and called, “Aunt Hagar.” The old woman arose with alacrity. “I ’lows hit mos’ time fo’ yuh to wek up. I has yo’ brekfus mos’ done, an’ yo’ clo’es is dry an’ ready fo’ yuh. Yo’ stockings is too raggety fo’ yuh to w’ar, an’ yo’ purty frock ain’ nothin’ but strips an’ strings. Yuh has to w’ar hit though; hit clean. An’ ’tain’ no matter ’bout de stockin’s, yuh ain’ gwine put yo’ footies to de groun’ fo’ a week; dat I say.” “But they feel much better; so much. And, oh, Aunt Hagar, you must have been up very early to have washed and ironed all my things.” “I gits up when I ready. I nuvver has no rug’lar time fo’ gittin’ up an’ gwine to baid,” she explained; and then she helped Lettice on with her clothes, after bringing her warm water in a tin basin, and attending to her wants. Then she made ready the breakfast on a deal table to which Lettice was assisted, after having been made to drink a copious draught of herb tea. “Mek yuh eat hearty, chile. Mek yuh feel nice, an’ keep off de chills, an’ mek yuh rosy an’ purty. Yuh doan’ want dem pale cheeks when Mars Bald’in’ aroun’,” coaxingly said Aunt Hagar. Lettice laughed, and, with a wry face, swallowed the draught, and, to her surprise, she found herself ready for a hearty breakfast, which seemed to taste uncommonly good, for Aunt Hagar was a famous cook and nurse, as she was a noted “conjur woman.” The girl had hardly finished her meal when “rap-rap” came at the door, and the latch was lifted to disclose her brother and her sister Betty, with the carriage, pillows, wraps, and all such paraphernalia. Sister Betty fell on Lettice’s neck, kissing and compassionating her. “Oh, you dear child, I was afraid you would be in a raging fever this morning. Oh, you poor little thing, what a dreadful, dreadful time you have had! Naughty girl, to run away from your home. Come, William, pick her up and carry her out to the carriage. It is not raining so hard, but her poor little tootsie-wootsies are all bound up, and she must be in a sorry plight, in spite of her brave looks.” “Aunt Hagar has been so good to me,” Lettice told them. “She has made a new girl of me. I am in rags, but they are clean ones, thanks to Aunt Hagar. I feel wonderfully peart this morning, after my woful adventures. And how is Mr. Baldwin? I judge he reached you safely.” “Yes, but in rather a sorry plight, for it was raining hard when he arrived, and the extra effort was none too good for him; but we have kept him in bed, and we will cosset him, and he will soon be well, I hope. He has come off worse than you, for he has a high fever, and I was loath to leave him; but Mammy is a good nurse, and I thought she could do better for him than I.” “He is a brave fellow,” William put in. “He made little of his part in your affair, and much of yours, but his condition shows that he fought manfully. Ah, little sister, if you had but stayed at home.” “Now, William, you shall not scold,” Betty interrupted. “The child has suffered enough, and she did what she thought was right, no doubt.” “I did hope I could get the papers,” said Lettice, wistfully, “and I thought the matter would be most easily settled so, and I was afraid that it would be too late if I waited till morning, so I went, and it was no use after all.” “Yet, perhaps it was,” her brother said gravely, “for the papers have come to light.” Lettice opened her eyes wide. “And how were they found?” “There is the mystery. Lutie brought them to me with a marvellous tale of their being handed to her to be placed in my hands, and she either pretended or she did not know who brought them. I questioned her, but she stuttered and stammered, and told about some one in a great cloak, and whose face she did not see, and she declared she was so mortal scared that she couldn’t have told who it was, anyhow, and a lot of stuff from which we could make neither head nor tail. But the papers are safe, although no one knows but that they have been copied. I would like to get at the bottom of the matter.” “Perhaps I can,” replied Lettice, thoughtfully. “At all events, I am glad they have been returned. And now we will go home.” So she was bundled into the carriage, and reached home with a thankful heart. But Aunt Hagar’s predictions came true, for it was a week before she could put her feet to the ground. CHAPTER XIII. _Confidences._ The rôle of patient which was enforced upon both Lettice and Mr. Baldwin was not altogether disagreeable to the pair. A couple of days was all the time that Mr. Baldwin would consent to remain in bed, and by that Lettice, too, was downstairs, looking, it is true, very pale and with blue shadows under her eyes, but quite herself otherwise. The knowledge of her night’s doings was kept a profound secret from all but her immediate family, although Aunt Martha and Rhoda were considered sufficiently discreet to be intrusted with an account of her adventures. It was James who told Rhoda about it, when he went over to make his farewells before going to join Barney’s flotilla, for he declared that he was in no mood for land service. “We can’t have every Tom, Dick, and Harry discussing Letty’s doings,” he said. “There are those just waiting for a chance to call her light and unmaidenly, travelling around alone in these times; although we, who know her, can impute it to nothing but pity and bravery. Besides, Cockburn and his men have such a name, that but to mention the fact of her having fallen into their hands, would give rise to exaggerated reports.” Rhoda nodded. “Yes, we who know her and love her would best say nothing about it. Lettice is a brave girl and a tender-hearted one, even if she is a bit too impulsive.” Jamie’s eyes beamed at this praise of his dearly loved sister from one who was always chary of her compliments; and when Rhoda expressed her determination to go at once to see Lettice, he gladly offered to be her escort. “I wish you were well out of here and safe in Boston,” he said. “With that terrible beast of a Cockburn infesting our shores, and every man feeling it his duty to be off with the militia, our homes are illy protected. Your father should not allow you to remain here.” Rhoda frowned, and half shut her eyes in a little haughty way that she had. “My father does what he thinks best. I do not dispute his judgment. He does not know, or is not willing to believe, the state of affairs down here.” Jamie made no response although he thought, “Nothing to his credit that it is so.” Lettice greeted Rhoda warmly. “It is good of you to come over to see this battered-up piece of humanity,” she said. “Am I not a decrepit?” She thrust out one bandaged foot as she stood holding to a chair. “Are you then so lame?” Rhoda asked with concern. “Yes, I am rather used up by sprains and bruises, but it is nothing serious, after all, and only demands that I keep quiet.” “Tell me about it,” Rhoda said abruptly, as she motioned Lettice to her place on the couch. And Lettice gave her a detailed account of her adventures, ending with, “And it was my very prettiest scarf, the silk one with many colored stripes that Uncle Tom brought me from Paris.” “How can you think of such slight things when it was all so serious?” Rhoda asked, in a puzzled tone. Lettice laughed. “Because I am so shallow, I suppose. I remember being thankful that I had that particular piece of finery, because it was so strong, and not like some of my others made of a lighter and more gauzy material. You see how I could let my thoughts run on dress, even in that desperate hour. I tell you I am only a butterfly.” “But you are not. You weep like a baby over the smallest thing, when it is weak and silly to do so, and you prink and coquet and parade your dress, but at heart you are brave and loyal, and have the greatest amount of endurance. I cannot make you out.” “No more can I you. I am a piece of vanity, and when there is anything to be gained by showing a brave front I can do it well enough; at other times I simply let myself go, and if I feel like crying I cry, when there is anybody around to pet me and make much of me, even if it is only Mammy.” Then she suddenly became grave. “Did you know that the papers were found? Or rather, they have been returned.” Rhoda started. “You don’t mean it!” “I do.” “Who returned them?” “My maid, Lutie.” “Was she the thief?” “No, I think,--I am quite positive, she was not. She says they were given to her to deliver to my brother.” “By whom?” “She does not tell. By the way, I promised my brother William that I would try to fathom the matter. Rhoda, where is Mr. Clinton?” Rhoda did not answer for a moment; then she said: “You still suspect him? Do you mean me to infer that you believe it was he who gave Lutie the papers?” “I don’t know what to think. I would rather fasten my suspicions on some one else, for more reasons than one.” “What reasons?” “I would rather be sure the papers had not been copied.” “You believe he would do such a thing as that? I do not. I have more faith in him than you, Lettice.” “Yet you do not love him.” “Have I said I do not?” “No, but I know it. I know one cannot love two men at the same time.” “Lettice, you presume.” “Do I? I don’t mean to; but--Ah well, Rhoda, we are but girls, and we are on the lookout for signs that escape others whose thoughts are not on romances.” “And you think you have read signs in me? Am I such a telltale, then?” “Far from it. You are unusually wary. But Rhoda, do you know that Jamie leaves us to-day?” The color mounted slowly to Rhoda’s face, tingeing even her ears with red. Lettice leaned over and said mockingly, as she possessed herself of Rhoda’s hand, “A sign, Rhoda! A sign! What does that blush mean?” Rhoda bit her lip, but did not raise her eyes. “Our bonny Jamie,” sighed Lettice. “Ah me, I hope God will spare him. I hope, O I hope--Oh, Rhoda, what if he should be going, never to return.” “Don’t!” cried Rhoda, in a sharp, quick voice. And then she snatched her hand from Lettice and, covering her face, sobbed in a convulsive, tearless way. “Rhoda, dear Rhoda,” cried Lettice. “What a wicked girl I am! I did not mean to be cruel to you. I should have had more consideration for your feelings and have kept my fears to myself.” She essayed to rise, but Rhoda motioned her back. “Come here, then, and sit by me that I may know that you forgive me,” she begged, and Rhoda came. Lettice caressed and soothed her so that in a few minutes she had regained her composure. “You asked about Robert,” she said. “He has gone to Washington and vows he will never return. He left his address, should any one wish to know of his whereabouts.” “I am glad. I think that is best.” Rhoda in her turn began to catechize. “Do you love him, Lettice?” “No, I can say truthfully that I do not. I was beginning to, I think; but now, I am so racked by doubt and mistrust that I have no room for any other feeling. I do not want to love him. This cloud would ever be rising between us. I would grieve to have harm come to him, and yet--” “You would denounce him to his enemies?” “If it would serve my country, yes. I could not tell a lie for him.” “Then you do not love him.” “Could you tell an untruth for one you loved?” Rhoda reflected. “I would not tell an untruth, but I would believe in him though no one else did, and I would not give up my belief while there was a shadow of a chance that he was innocent. And, in any event, I would be very sure before I declared a person guilty who might be proved innocent.” “That is why I went to you the other night,” replied Lettice. “And I did not denounce him before any one but Mr. Baldwin, and that was in the heat of my surprise and anger.” “I know that. But we have been over this subject before. He is gone and will not return. Let us talk of something else. Your Mr. Baldwin, where is he?” “_My_ Mr. Baldwin, as you are pleased to call him, is here in the room across the hall. Would you like to call on him?” “Not I.” “He is a brave young gentleman, and good to look at.” “Ah, that is why you are not sure of your feeling for Robert.” “No, it is not,” returned Lettice, quickly. “And that brings us back to the question we were discussing a few minutes ago. Could a girl love two men at once?” Rhoda did not answer. She arose and said: “I am staying too long. I must go back to Aunt Martha. I promised her I would be back soon. Your brother William has returned to his company?” “Yes; he was at home but one day and could remain no longer. With the British such near neighbors, the militia must not be caught napping. The plantations are suffering for lack of attention, but the men must fight though the crops fail in consequence. Will you send Lutie to me, if you see her on your way down? And do come soon again.” Rhoda promised and took her leave. In a few minutes Lutie appeared. She had not shown her usual devotion to her mistress during the last day or two, and seemed anxious to efface herself, a proceeding strictly the opposite to her usual one. “You want me, Miss Letty?” she said as she came in. “Yes, I do. I don’t want to be left up here all alone. It seems to me, Lutie, you have a precious lot of work downstairs, for you try to slip out every chance you get.” “Miss Rhoda, she hyar,” Lutie began protestingly. “I know she was here, but she is not now. I never thought you would neglect your own Miss Letty, Lutie; especially when she is half sick, and cannot get around without some one’s help. Haven’t I always been good to you?” “Yass, miss, yuh has indeed.” “Then look here; tell me the truth. Now don’t look so scared; I am not going to have you whipped. You know you never had a whipping in your life, except from your own mammy. I want you to tell me who gave you those papers to give to your Marster William.” Lutie began to sniffle. “’Deed, Miss Letty, I didn’t see him. He have a cloak over him, an’ he hide his face, an’ he a gre’t big man.” “With fiery eyes like Napoleon Bonaparte that you’re so afraid of? Now look here, is it any one I know?” “Yass, miss.” Lutie spoke in a tremulous voice. “Was it--now speak the truth--was it--” Lettice looked cautiously around and lowered her voice--“Mr. Clinton?” Lutie writhed, and twisted, and looked every way but at her mistress. “Remember, you’ll be sorry if you don’t tell.” “Miss Letty, what yuh gwine do ef I don’t tell?” at last Lutie inquired in desperation. “What am I going to do? Don’t you know that old Aunt Hagar comes here every day to see me? You know she is a cunjure woman, she’ll do anything I ask her. You’d better look out.” “’Deed an’ ’deed, Miss Letty,” wailed Lutie, dropping on her knees, and rocking back and forth, “I so skeered.” “Of the Poly Bonypart man or the cunjure woman? Which?” “Bofe of ’em. An’ I skeered o’ dat Cockbu’n. Jubal say he mos’ wuss’n Poly Bonypart.” “Jubal does?” “Yass’m. Oh, Miss Letty, don’ mek me tell.” “Humph!” Lettice rested her chin in her hand and thoughtfully regarded the girl sobbing at her feet. “Lutie,” she said after a pause, “what did Jubal tell you about Cockburn and his men?” “He say,” Lutie replied, weeping copiously, “he say ef I tells, ole Cockbu’n git me an’ mek me dance er breakdown on hot coals; an’ he t’ar out mah white teef an’ give ’em to he men to shoot out o’ dey guns lak bullets; and he snatch uvver scrap o’ wool off mah haid, fo’ to mek gun wads outen; an’ he brek uvver bone in mah body, an’ de Britishers rattle ’em when dey play dey chunes ter march by.” Jubal could display a delightfully vivid imagination when it served his purpose. “That certainly would be something terrible,” Lettice commented gravely. “I don’t wonder you are scared; but you know it would be nearly as bad if you wasted away,--hungry, and couldn’t eat; thirsty, and couldn’t drink; and if your teeth were to drop out one by one, and if your eyes were to roll up into your head and never come down again; and if those you love wouldn’t love you, and if some one gave Jubal a charm so he’d hate you. You know what a cunjure woman can do.” Lutie burst into loud wails. “Oh, Miss Letty! Spare me, Lawd! Spare me! I a po’ mizzible sinner. What shall I do? What shall I do? Oh, Miss Letty, don’ let Aunt Hagar chawm Jubal, please, miss. I die fo’ yuh. I serve yuh han’ an’ foot.” “There, Lutie, there,” said Lettice, feeling that in her application of Jubal’s methods she had gone too far, “come here. Sit down there.” She put her hand on the girl’s shoulder. “You want to marry Jubal, I suppose. I knew he had been philandering about you for some time. Are you really fond of him?” Lutie’s wails subsided into a sniffle. “Yass, miss,” she answered meekly. “Well, then, I promise you that I will not let any harm come to him or you through anything you may tell me, if you tell the truth. And, moreover, I’ll get Aunt Hagar to make you a luck-ball, and I will not tell a living soul who it was that gave you the papers, as long as there is any danger coming to either of you from it. But if you don’t tell me the truth--then--” Lutie’s sobs were again on the increase. “Oh-h, Miss Letty, I sholy is hard pressed. I is skeert one way by ole Cockbu’n an’ turrer by de cunjurin’. I mos’ mo’ skeerter by de cunjurin’.” “But you won’t tell your mistress, who has always been good and kind to you, when you know it would save her a great deal of trouble? You won’t tell unless she threatens to punish you? Ah, Lutie, think what I might do to make you tell, if I were a hard mistress.” “Miss Letty, Miss Letty, ’deed, ma’am, I don’t want to do yuh so mean. Yuh won’t let Jubal come to no ha’m, will yuh, Miss Letty?” “No, I promised you, so far as I have any voice in it, I will not. Don’t make me repeat it, you disrespectful girl.” “Miss Letty, I so bothered in mah haid I fergits mah manners,” said Lutie, humbly. “I knows a lady lak yuh ain’ gwine tell me no story, an’ when yuh says nobody know, nobody ain’ gwine know. Miss Letty,--hit were Jubal hisse’f.” And again the girl lapsed into violent weeping, and the rocking back and forth continued. Lettice was very quiet for a moment. “There, Lutie,” she then said, “you needn’t cry any more. You are as safe as can be, and so is Jubal. I will not tell on him, but I want you to tell me all you know about it. Did any one give him the papers to give to your Marster William?” “No, ma’am, Miss Letty, he peepin’ froo de bushes when yuh puts de box in de groun’, an’ he say he think dey is gol’ an’ silver derein, an’ he want git me one o’ dem carneely rings, an’ he jes think he tek a little an’ nobody miss hit, an’ ef dey do, dey’ll think de Britishers done git hit; den when he open de box an’ fin’ nothin’ but dem papers in hit, he lay out fur to put hit back agin, but he ain’ had no chanst lak he mean ter do, an’ so he give hit ter me, an’ say I is ter give hit ter Mars William an’ do lak he say, an’ I so do; an’ he say ef I tells, de Britishers is sho’ to come after me, ’cause dey want dem papers.” “How did he know that?” “He heahs yuh-alls talkin’ ’bout hit dat night he waitin’ on de gin’ral in de gre’t hall. Yass, miss, he say all dat.” Lutie was very quiet now, and only her wet eyes showed recent weeping. “Very good,” said Lettice. “Of course Jubal ought to be punished. He has caused more mischief than he knows, and he is not half good enough for you, Lutie; although, poor ignorant boy, it was a temptation,” she added, half to herself. “Now dry your eyes, Lutie, and go get that pink muslin out of the closet. I am going to give that to you because you told the truth. I’m sorry I haven’t a ‘carneely’ ring, but there is a string of blue beads in that box; you may have those.” Lutie fell on her knees and kissed her mistress’s bandaged feet in her ecstasy at this deliverance from despair and this elevation to heights of bliss, and in a minute she was bearing off her treasures, every white tooth gleaming, as she viewed these darling possessions. “I am bound to make no explanations,” said Lettice to herself. “What a complication it is, and how badly I have treated poor Robert. No wonder he was so hurt and angry and indignant. Alas, if I tell any one that he is innocent, I will have to prove it, and that I have promised not to do. I shall have to wait events, I suppose. Brother William is away, and there is no one else who will press inquiries. Yet, am I not bound to clear Robert to Mr. Baldwin, and I can do nothing else than write to Washington to Robert himself. Dear, dear, what a scrape I am in!” At this moment Lutie reappeared with the message: “Miss Letty, Miss Betty say is yuh able to come down to supper? Mr. Bald’in, he comin’, an’ she say she wisht yuo’d mek yose’f ready, is yuh able.” “I am able, but some one will have to help me to hobble. Go tell Miss Betty, and then come back and dress me.” She felt a little flutter of excitement at again meeting the companion of her late adventures, and selected her dress with some care. Yet she sighed once or twice. She had been very unjust to Robert, and of course he could never forgive her. Yes, it was as he had said; that dream was over. Nevertheless, she had a little feeling of resentment toward him because he had not assured her of his innocence. “If he had not reproached me, but had told me, I would have believed him,” she told herself. She had been too hasty, she admitted, but like many other persons, she did not feel willing to exculpate the supposed offender from all blame and to acknowledge herself in the wrong, and her feeling of resentment in consequence almost overcame her regrets. CHAPTER XIV. “_Sorrow an’ Trouble._” The two who had lately been companions in misery met each other, at the supper table, for the first time since the evening of their perilous experience. “This is but our third meeting,” said Mr. Baldwin, “and how various the circumstances.” “There is a mighty big difference between a ball-room, Aunt Hagar’s cabin, and our present surroundings,” Lettice returned. “We cannot complain of monotony. How are you, Mr. Baldwin? Mammy tells me your fever ran high, and no wonder; I have felt like a rag, myself.” “Thanks to good nursing I am much better, and shall be able to proceed to Washington to-morrow, I trust.” “You are not well enough,” Mrs. Betty protested. “We cannot let you go when you are but half mended.” “Ah, but there is no word but duty to those who have promised to serve their country,” replied the young man. “Yes, but one owes a duty to one’s self as well as to one’s country,” Betty returned. “Every man is needed. With so little success on the frontier, reverses at sea, and this vandal, Cockburn, ready to destroy and pillage along these shores, it is every man’s duty to be at his post, if he is able to get there.” “Yes, I suppose so,” Betty sighed. “That is what William says. With his father and uncle on the frontier, his brother gone to join Barney, and with the plantations running to waste down here, they all have no word but duty.” “And that is right,” Lettice spoke up. “It is to protect their women and their homes that they go.” Mr. Baldwin nodded with a pleased smile. “After all that you have suffered, to hear you say that, Miss Lettice, proves that you are very loyal.” “I am the more so that I have suffered. The worse we are treated the more eager we are for the war to go on.” “That is beginning to be the prevailing spirit. But I wish I could know you safe in Baltimore. I think it is very unsafe for ladies to be left unprotected when the enemy is so near.” “And such an enemy!” cried Betty. “Then don’t you think you ought to stay and protect us, Mr. Baldwin?” He laughed. “You make me choose my words, and put me in the position of seeming very ungallant. I must go. I cannot do otherwise.” “Yes, I agree with you,” Lettice gave her opinion, “and if I were a man I would go too.” And Betty arising from the table, they adjourned to another room, Lettice being carefully assisted by the young man. “Each moment I remain is dangerous,” he whispered, “for each moment it becomes less my desire to leave.” Lettice blushed, and while Betty went to her baby, they two sat in a corner of the wide hall and had a long talk. They had not many friends in common, but they loved their country, and they had struggled with a common foe; then no wonder they were not long strangers. “I have never asked you where your home is,” said Lettice, to her companion. “You do not talk like a Southerner, and yet you are Tyler’s cousin. I do not seem to distinguish your native place by your speech.” “I am from Massachusetts,” he told her, “but I am something of a cosmopolitan, as every one who follows the sea must be.” “From Massachusetts? I thought every one in that state was dead set against the war.” “Oh, no, not every one. To be sure, New Englanders, as a rule, are against it; but if you should investigate, you would find many gallant soldiers and sailors hailing from our part of the country.” “Have you always lived there?” “Always. My father lived there all his life, and my grandfather before him, and I am very proud of my native city. Tyler Baldwin and I are second cousins; his grandfather and mine were brothers, and as I was for some time in Annapolis, near my father’s kin, I came to know them quite well.” “I am very glad to find one New Englander so fierce a fighter in this war. It doesn’t seem right that when she did so much in the Revolution--not that it was more than we did--but when she did so much then, that she should be so dreadfully indifferent now, when it is just as much a war for freedom. I am afraid that, like our old cat there, New England has grown fat and lazy in prosperity. I think I’ll name that cat New England, for she has no special name; Puss seems to be sufficient for her own uses.” Mr. Baldwin laughed, and they chatted on contentedly till the big clock in the hall warned them of the lateness of the hour, and, beyond that, Mammy had been hovering around for some time, with uneasy glances at her patient. “I feel as if I had known you for years,” Lettice said, as she bade the young man good night. “If length of time be counted by the amount of pleasure it brings, I have known you for years,” he returned gallantly. The next morning he took his leave, and the two women, left alone with the servants, looked forward with dread to what the days might bring them. But before long their hearts were cheered by news from the North; that news which, in the never-to-be-forgotten words, “We have met the enemy and they are ours,” announced Perry’s victory to a grateful people. Report after report of victories at sea had come, but none that matched in importance that which was won by Perry on Lake Erie. All over the country bells were set ringing, cities were illuminated, toasts were drunk to the young hero, and odes were addressed to him; and those who before had felt very dubious, now began to place unlimited faith in the success of the American side. Even Aunt Martha and Rhoda rejoiced openly, for the former still obstinately refused to leave the plantation, and the latter felt it her “dooty” to remain likewise. She was a very sweet and gentle Rhoda these days, and Lettice grew more and more fond of her. Lettice, it may be said, was not long in recovering her usual health and spirits. One of the first visits she made was to Aunt Hagar. She bore her a gift from Mr. Baldwin, and the old woman was greatly puffed up by the possession of a five dollar gold piece. She made mysterious incantations, and consulted teacups and cards, and used other means of reading Lettice’s fortune. The fair man and the dark man, and the fair woman that came between, and the surprise that was partly agreeable and partly disagreeable, were all there, but the most impressive of all was a prophecy which seemed greatly to disturb the old woman herself. “Sorrow an’ trouble,” she said, “to you an’ yo’ house. Law, honey, law, honey, I is sholy distu’bed to see dat. From across water comes black death, an’ here is weepin’ an’ wailin’ an’ gnashin’ of teef. Dey is meetin’ an’ partin’, an’ ’live is daid, an’ daid is ’live. Dat is de mos’ cur’os fortune I has fo’ many a day. I wisht I ain’ seen it, I sholy is. I dat hu’t in mah min’ I can’t sleep dis night. What dis? I lak to know who dat. Go long home, honey. I so ’stracted I dunno what I sayin’.” And after Lettice left, until late in the night, the old woman pored over her pack of cards, shaking her head and muttering, “Sorrow an’ trouble.” The next day came a messenger in the person of a small, kinkey-headed darkey. “Mammy Hagar say will Miss Letty come see her. She turr’ble sorry to trouble her, an’ she ain’ meanin’ no disrespec’, but she got sumpin’ to tell her, an’ please, miss, come by yo’sef.” Lettice donned her cloak and hat and set off, wondering what was meant by this. It was early afternoon, and the scene was fair and peaceful. One could scarce realize that war ravaged the land. She sauntered along through the woods, stopping every now and then to pick a leaf which had reddened early, or to watch a partridge hurry to cover. At Aunt Hagar’s door she knocked. The latch was lifted, and the wrinkled face of the old woman appeared. She whispered mysteriously, “Come in, honey,” and shutting the door carefully, she beckoned her visitor to one corner of the room which was screened off by an old quilt. Here, on a rude pallet, lay a man. Lettice started back. “Who is it?” she cried. “Dat what I say.” “Where did he come from?” “He layin’ out in de holler o’ de ole house what got burnted, an’ I gits him here, an’ he cl’ar outen his haid an’ stupefy. He one o’ dem Britishers, yuh reckon?” Lettice observed him more closely; then she gave an exclamation of surprise. “Why Aunt Hagar, it is Pat--poor Patrick Flynn!” “Is dat so? I says, ‘whar I see him befo?’ Dat jes’ who.” “But how did he get here?” “I jes’ drug him along. I right spry yit, an’ I git him a little way an’ den drap him an’ git mah bref twel I gits him to de boat. I say ef he a fren’, I boun’ to cyo’ him up, an’ ef he a Britisher--what yuh reckon I do, Miss Letty?” “I don’t know. Don’t let us talk of that. It would be hard to decide. As it is, I am very glad it is poor Patrick. He should be taken at once to Aunt Martha’s--but no, he probably escaped from some British ship, and was shot while trying to get away. We shall have to keep him in hiding till he gets well.” “Das what I say, an’ dat why I ast yuh come look at him. I say Miss Letty so sma’t she know ef he a Britisher, fo’ all dem clo’es he w’ars.” “I hope he will get well,” said Lettice. “What a joy it will be to his mother if he does. It is just as well that she should not know that he is here, for if he should not recover, she would have the double grief of losing him. Take good care of him, Aunt Hagar, and I will send over some things for him from the house. I will tell Sister Betty. Perhaps she will insist on having him removed to our house, although I really think he is much safer here;” a wise decision, as was proved true before the week was out. It was late one rainy evening that Rhoda and Lettice were sitting in the open doorway, listening to the patter of the rain on the leaves. “I feel very dreary, and full of forebodings,” said Lettice. “I suppose it is because the autumn is so near. I always hate to see the summer go, and I believe that somehow Aunt Hagar has scared me into thinking something dreadful is going to happen.” “Something dreadful is happening all the time,” Rhoda answered. “I certainly think that an ignorant old woman’s vagaries have nothing to do with it. I am not so superstitious.” “Then you are not a descendant of a Salem witch,” returned Lettice, laughing. “Yes, I am, and that perhaps is why I abhor superstition,” Rhoda spoke in all seriousness. “One of my ancestors was accused of witchcraft, but fortunately the delusion ended before she was executed by the fanatics who hounded the poor innocent creatures to their death. Hark! What is that?” There was a sound of running feet; of shots fired; of sudden cries. The two girls clung close together, and Betty hurried to the door, while the house servants gathered around, quaking with fear. Presently from out of the gloom a dark figure staggered toward them and, stumbling, fell at their feet; then another rushed past them into the house. He blew out the candle Betty held and disappeared. Outside was a clatter and a clamor. A swearing, threatening band of redcoats surrounded the house. For a moment the three women stood transfixed with horror: then Lettice sprang indoors and blew a shrill whistle which brought from the quarters those negroes who had not gone into hiding at the approach of the soldiers. Their appearance added to the rage of the enemy. The leader struck a light, and taking the candle from Betty’s nerveless hand he relighted it. “Aha, some pretty girls!” cried out one of the men behind him. “We’ll find the vile deserter, and then we’ll have some sport with the ladies, eh, boys? Here’s my choice.” And he seized Rhoda, who shrank back with a faint moan. This but added to the man’s delight and drew her nearer. But at this moment the prostrate man on the porch, who by painful effort had dragged himself to the sill of the door, feebly raised the pistol he held, fired, and Rhoda was free to rush out of the open door into the darkness. Those inside were sobered down. “Here, men, search the house,” said the leader, sternly. “Fire on any one who dares to stand in the way.” “What shall we do! What shall we do!” Lettice moaned in despair. But Betty had rushed upstairs to her baby, and Rhoda was not in sight. The figure by the door had crawled out into the gloom again. How many of the enemy might be outside Lettice could not determine, and she stood trembling, daring neither to leave the house nor to follow the men who had gone to the upper rooms. Finally she ventured out upon the porch. Near the door Rhoda crouched, and in her lap rested the head of the wounded man whose shot had felled her assailant. She was murmuring incoherent words. Lettice drew near. “Rhoda, Rhoda,” she whispered, “who is it?” “Oh, Lettice! Oh, Lettice, he is dying!” she cried in a shaken voice. “It is Jamie! Jamie!” Lettice dropped on her knees by the side of the dear lad who lay very still. Lettice lifted his hand and held it between her own, her tears falling fast. She did not heed the tread of the men who returned from their fruitless search. “The miserable wretch has escaped us somehow,” as in a dream she heard one say. “This is the second we have lost this week.” He leaned over and touched Lettice’s cheek. “Get up here, girl. I want to look at you,” he said. Lettice, with streaming eyes arose and with clasped hands approached the leader of the band. “Sir, yonder dying man is my dearly loved brother,” she said. “Will you not leave us alone with our great sorrow? We would be but triste companions for your men. Take what you will, but leave us these last few moments sacred from intrusion.” The man stood looking at her a moment; then turned on his heel. “The presence of a lovely female in distress was always too much for me,” he muttered. “We will pursue our search further, and perhaps will pay you a visit later. We will respect your desire to be alone. We, too, have lost a friend.” He nodded toward the hall where his comrade lay. “He has gone beyond our resentment,” said Lettice, gently. “We will bury him in our own graveyard, unless you wish to bear him away with you.” “No, he will rest as well in one spot as in another,” returned the man. “We will continue our duty and leave him to your kind offices.” He then gathered his men about him and strode away. Betty had followed the searching party downstairs, and now appeared with the candle. She held it so its rays fell on Jamie’s white face. “Jamie!” she cried. “Our Jamie! Oh, what terrible thing is this?” He opened his eyes and smiled to see Rhoda bending over him. “I saved you, dear, didn’t I?” he whispered. “Yes, you saved me,” she controlled her voice sufficiently to answer. He let his gaze rest a moment upon her, and then he looked at Lettice. “Kiss me, little sister,” he said. She leaned over and kissed his pale lips. One of his hands stirred as if seeking something, and Rhoda slipped her fingers in his. He gave them a slightly perceptible pressure. His eyes, large and imploring, searched her face. She understood what he would ask, and she, too, leaned over and kissed him solemnly, and into the searching eyes crept a satisfied look. “Can we not get him into the house?” said Betty, in distress. “Is there nothing we can do?” For answer there was a quiver of the lad’s eyelids, one sigh, and then his young heart had ceased to beat. Down the road the British soldiers were disappearing. The three women sat sobbing convulsively. They had no thought for past or present danger, nor for anything but the presence of this great sorrow. After a while one of the colored men stole up. “Dey all gone, Miss Betty,” he said. As he spoke from the house appeared before them another figure, and some one dropped upon his knees and covered his face with his hands. “Jamie, Jamie, little brother!” he groaned. “Would to God I had been the one!” The startled women lifted their heads. “Brother Tom!” cried Lettice. “Oh, Brother Tom!” Then Aunt Hagar’s words returned to her, and she repeated: “‘The dead shall be alive, and the alive shall be dead.’ Oh, Brother Tom, it is Jamie, our Jamie!” “Who lost his life in saving mine,” said the young man. “Let us bear him indoors.” And tenderly lifting their burden, they laid him in the great hall. Lettice felt that it was good to have this lost brother to soothe and comfort her, albeit his return brought no joy, for the shadow was too great. She was confused and heart-broken, so that no explanations were offered that night. Lettice had but asked, “Are you safe here, Brother Tom?” and he had replied: “Safer than elsewhere. They have searched here once and have not found me; they will not come again at once, and we shall be gone before another day. I cannot leave you here to be exposed to these dangers, little sister, and we must get off to Baltimore as soon as ever we can.” Even the next day they asked no questions, for in the evening, at sunset, they laid Jamie to rest in the old graveyard, and in one corner they buried, too, the British soldier who had met his death through Jamie’s last effort for Rhoda. Friend and foe, the service was read over them, and they were left asleep, with all differences forever stilled. Rhoda, in her self-control and reticence, gave little evidence of what she felt, and it was only when Lettice saw the anguish in her eyes that she realized that Rhoda’s best love was buried with Jamie; and when she returned to the house she remembered the packet which Jamie had given her. She followed Rhoda to her room to give it to her. The girl was lying, face down, upon the floor, in tearless grief. She did not hear Lettice’s light tap at the door, nor did she heed her entrance. “Jamie, oh, my darling!” she moaned. And Lettice, with eyes overflowing, put her arms around her. “Dear Rhoda,” she said, “he left something for you.” And into her hand she gave the little packet. Rhoda’s cold fingers closed over it, and in a minute she sat up. “Stay with me, Lettice,” she begged. “We will open this together.” She reverently undid the little box. On top lay a paper on which was written: “For Rhoda, from one who loved her with all his heart. God bless you and keep you and make you happy, my darling. From Jamie.” There was a case underneath. Rhoda lifted it out and touched the spring, to disclose a lock of curly auburn hair and a miniature of Jamie. As his bonny face smiled up at her, Rhoda gave a great cry and shed the first tears her eyes had known since that moment when his spirit passed. “It is so like, so like,” she murmured. “How I shall treasure it, Lettice. My bonny Jamie, how shall I live through the long years? And you will never know how much I loved you.” “He knows now,” said Lettice, softly. And she went out, leaving Rhoda more comforted by this than by anything that could have come to her. CHAPTER XV. _Jubal._ The next day the two girls parted, not to meet again for many a long day. Aunt Martha had received a letter from her husband, in which he begged that she would leave the plantation and return to Baltimore. He had heard of the depredations along the Chesapeake, and was filled with anxiety for her. Therefore she concluded to follow his advice, and made ready to go back to her city home. Betty, likewise, vowed that she could not remain, for these late scenes had completely unnerved her, and she decided to pack up and go to her father in Kent County, and Lettice agreed to go with her, after receiving the approval of her brother Tom as to the step. “I will hunt up William,” he said, “and will report to him of your movements.” Before he left, he told them of how he had been picked up by a British vessel, on that day, so long ago, when he had fallen overboard, and how he had fallen into the captain’s humor when he pretended to believe he was one of his own men, and he had joined the service, determining to escape when he had enough of it. Later on he found himself on board a vessel on which were his old acquaintances, Pat Flynn and Johnny Carter. The three put their heads together and laid plans by which they might manage to get away. Tom was the first to make the attempt, and one dark night dropped overboard. He had not given his true name to any one during all this time, nor did he do so when he was picked up by an American vessel. “I shall never forget,” he said, “how bravely a young lieutenant stood by me. He was taking in a prize when he sent out a boat to pick me up, and after I told him my story, he swore he would never give me up, though he died for it. He had a chance to prove his words not long after, and stand by me he did, to such an extent that a fight was on before I knew it, and we carried in two prizes instead of one. But as ill luck would have it, on my way home I was taken prisoner just outside our own bay, for the vessel on which I was returning had a little set-to with a British cruiser, and I was nabbed and brought in. But home was too near for me not to make desperate efforts to get to it, and so I did, with what result you see. I hope Pat got away. Poor fellow, he was bent on it, if chance offered.” “He did then,” Lettice was able to tell him, and she gave an account of him; then begged Tom to continue his story. “As I was making for shore,” he went on, “swimming up the little creek I knew so well, whom should I see at the old landing where we always kept the boat, but some one else getting ready to row across; and who should it be but Jamie. I did not know him, for he was only a little chap when I last saw him, but he recognized me, and was overjoyed to see me, in spite of all my misdeeds, and we started off, when pell-mell came a party of British after me. The best thing we could do was to try to cut across and reach home the long way, instead of coming over the creek. So we landed, and at first got along very well, but the wretches, piloted by some one who knew the way, caught sight of us just before we reached here. Jamie kept encouraging me, and said if we could but get to the house it would be all right, and he reminded me of our old hiding-place; but I tripped and fell over the roots of the old locust tree, and Jamie, never thinking of saving himself, stopped to help me up. I cried out to him to go on, but he would not, and he was hit just as we reached the steps. I didn’t even know it, for he called out, ‘I’m right behind you, Tom’, and--” he stopped short and could not go on. Lettice was sobbing, her face against her brother’s broad shoulder. Betty’s tears were falling fast, and she said unsteadily, “Greater love hath no man than this.” “Go on, Tom,” said Lettice. “Our dear one is safe; oh, so safe.” “God grant that when my time comes, I shall not forget his example!” said Tom, brokenly. He was silent for a moment, and then went on with his story. “I had the wit to blow out the candle, and I ran upstairs to the little closet under the eaves at the end of the garret, that was struck by lightning and boarded up afterward; you know the place, and how it can be reached from the roof by going down the scuttle on that side.” “They hunted through the garret well,” said Betty, “but there was so much piled up this side that they never dreamed there could be any one beyond. I had forgotten the place myself, though William has often told me how you boys used to hide there and make a playroom of that end of the garret.” “Jamie had suggested it as a good place, and told me I would find it just the same, so I concealed myself till, through the chinks, I saw the rascals go off, and then as Jamie had not come, I was seized with a mighty fear for him, and could not stay. It will be sad news for our father.” “Yes; but there will be good news for him, too,” Lettice tried to comfort him by saying. “We have you again.” A little later, with a quiet good-by to her brother, she parted from him and made ready for her own departure. Lutie, her unwilling helper, dawdled so persistently over the packing that Lettice at last spoke up sharply. “We’ll never get ready at this rate. I’ll leave you here to be gobbled up by the British if you don’t move faster, Lutie.” But this threat did not seem to have the desired effect, for, though Lutie hung her head, she looked more cheerful, and Lettice, bending down, regarded her searchingly. “I believe you want to stay,” she said severely. “I believe you want to desert your mistress, Lutie.” Lutie’s head hung still lower. “No, ma’am, Miss Letty, ’deed I doesn’t; but I wisht yuh wa’nt gwine.” “Why? You are so scared of Cockburn and his men, and yet, now there is danger, you don’t want to leave. Ah, I see; it is Jubal. And what does Jubal say, pray?” “He say dey ain’ gwine tech me, but dey gwine run yuh-alls off. An’ he say ef he’d a knowed hit were Mars Torm what runned f’om ’em, he’d foun’ a way ter git him home better’n de way he come.” “Humph!” Lettice was thoughtful. “Lutie,” she cried suddenly, “I believe it was Jubal who informed on him. It was Jubal who showed of explaining my deliberate neglect of duty last year. You were reduced to ranks as a result and Farnum was then given your position as acting senior cadet officer of the summer detail. If he'd had any sense of fitness he would have reported himself rather than have accepted it; that was only a temporary affair, however, and didn't amount to much; but because of that same report it's outrageous that you should be shoved out of the five stripes you've earned by a man who was equally guilty, but didn't have the manhood to report himself when you did." "It's rotten," remarked Glassfell. "Well, Stone, old chap," he continued, "I'm sorry; everybody will be; we all thought you had a cinch on five stripes. But I wouldn't be in Farnum's shoes; everybody will know he is a fake. But as long as they didn't make Stonewell cadet commander I'm rather surprised they didn't give the job to me." "Look here, Bob," said Stonewell, "I have been hoping you would get three stripes--but I'm sorry not to see you down for anything." "That's too bad; isn't Bob down for anything?" inquired Glassfell. "Not even for a second class buzzard, the lowest thing in cadet rank at the Naval Academy," replied Stonewell. "I'm sorry to hear that," remarked Glassfell, much concerned. "Bob ought to have three stripes, anyway." "Don't you worry, fellows," said Robert, cheerily, "I haven't expected a thing and am not a bit disappointed. A midshipman cannot live down a 'deliberate neglect of duty' report in one year." "Yes, Bob, I know, but I had hoped that your conduct at the fire a year ago and that remarkable trip of yours last June would----" "Now, Stone, please don't; you know that is not to be talked about." "Of course, but at the same time in spite of that report you ought to get three stripes." "That's right," commented Glassfell. "The officers only see one side of a midshipman's character; here I am, another martyr to their ignorance; I'm one of the best men in the class, the band master thinks so, and he's the grandest thing I've ever seen at Annapolis; and I'm a private in ranks for another year. But perhaps this report isn't authentic; let's see, the paper says that it is likely that these recommendations will be made to the superintendent by the commandant; the former is away, will not arrive at Annapolis for two days yet--hurrah, I may still get five stripes." "Stone, I still hope you may command the brigade of midshipmen our last year," said Robert thoughtfully. "This newspaper account does not pretend to be official; it says 'it has leaked out' that the commandant of midshipmen's recommendation of the assignment of cadet officers of the brigade will be so and so. Now the superintendent evidently has not seen these recommendations, so they are not as yet finally decided upon. Probably this newspaper list is correct in the main, but it is not final; the superintendent is away on leave and has not yet acted; he has not even seen the commandant's recommendations. If either the superintendent or the commandant were to know that Farnum had been guilty of the same offense which is now to deprive you of the five stripes you otherwise, by every count, had earned, you would never be set aside in favor of a man equally guilty but not so square. It's shameful, that's what it is." Robert boiled over with angry thoughts. Strong feelings dominated his expressive features, and it was with difficulty that he controlled himself. His classmate Stonewell was at once his joy and pride, and he loved him with brotherly affection. Stonewell in his studies towered above all of his classmates; he was the leader in athletics, captain of the football team, and captain of the Academy crew. He was class president and his own class and all midshipmen confidently expected he would be cadet commander in his last year at the Naval Academy. But Robert Drake more than wished for it. Until this moment he had not realized how he longed for it. In the preceding three years at Annapolis Robert had had perhaps more than his own share of troubles, and in them all Stonewell had been to him a mountain of strength and a deep well of affectionate wisdom. "Farnum for our five striper! Faugh! The thought of it makes me sick! I'll not stand for it," cried Robert. "How can you help it, Bob?" queried Glassfell, himself much disappointed, though not nearly so vehement as Robert. "I'll tell you what I'm going to do," almost shouted the latter; "Stone and I will be in Annapolis the day after to-morrow, and I'm going straight to the commandant and convince him that he's made a big bust. That's what I'm going to do!" "No, you're not, Bob," said Stonewell, quietly, yet determinedly; "you'll do nothing of the kind. The commandant isn't going to give me five stripes just because you want me to have them. You've had some troubles at the Academy, partly due perhaps to a sort of unrestrained impetuosity. Sometimes you are apt to mix up in matters that other people don't admit concern you. You'll do me more harm than good if you're not careful; and as a friend of mine I demand you do nothing whatever about this matter." Robert knew that Stonewell meant exactly what he said, yet he could not give in at once. "Look here, Stone," he doggedly maintained, "some one ought to do this, and I'm the man. Why don't you wish me to?" "I've given you one good reason, Bob, and I'll give you another. It wouldn't be fair to Farnum." "It wouldn't be fair to Farnum!" ejaculated Robert. "It wouldn't be fair to Farnum," he again repeated, in astonished accents. "Will you please tell me why it would be unfair to that sneak? How could it be unfair to him for me to make a plain statement of facts to the commandant, a statement that would prevent Farnum from being put into a high position which is utterly undeserved?" "I'll tell you, Bob; to begin with you've made a mistake about Farnum; he's not at all the poor character, the sneak, you think him to be. You don't know him. You've good reason to know how unfair it is to be misunderstood. Your action would be particularly unfair to Farnum because the first thing he will do when he gets to Annapolis will be to go to the commandant and tell him just what you have said you intended doing." "You've a better opinion of Farnum than I have, Stone," rejoined Robert, shortly. "If he does that I'll apologize to him. But if he doesn't--well, he'll have a mighty uncomfortable year, in spite of his five stripes, that's all I've got to say." CHAPTER II THE COMMANDANT OF MIDSHIPMEN Drake and Stonewell reached Washington the next morning, and the following morning took a train bound for Annapolis. They were ahead of the yearly rush of midshipmen returning from September leave; members of the Naval Academy football team are expected to sacrifice part of their precious vacation in order to commence football practice early. Hardly were they aboard their train when a tall, fine-looking young man, of perhaps twenty-one or twenty-two years, approached them. In his hurried glance at Robert and Stonewell one might have seen an expression of pleasure combined with uncertainty, the pleasure when looking at Stonewell, the uncertainty when his gaze rested momentarily upon Robert. "How do you do, Stonewell?" he said, in a rather precise way, extending his hand to him. "I'm glad to see you and Drake; have you seen any others of the football squad?" "Hello, Farnum, how are you, old chap? I'm real glad to see you," said Stonewell, heartily. "No, I haven't seen any midshipmen but you yet." "How are you, Drake?" continued Farnum, rather pointedly, and stood with hand outstretched toward Drake. Apparently the latter did not see Farnum's hand; he made no effort to take it, but with his own right hand he touched his hat and said: "Hello, Farnum." Farnum's hand dropped to his side, and he said impulsively, "Why won't you shake hands with me, Drake? I would like to be friendly with you, and I don't know why we shouldn't be friends. Perhaps you are thinking of the time when most of us misjudged you, a matter that no one has more regretted than I have." "Farnum," said Robert, "you remember our second class summer, don't you, when I was reported for deliberate neglect of duty?" "Surely," answered Farnum. "And you remember why I neglected my duty? I was on as 'midshipman in charge of floor' when you and Stone and Pete and some others were Frenching, and I left my post so as not to have to report you all." "I remember that very well indeed," rejoined Farnum; "what of it?" "Stone and the rest of them, except you, reported themselves for the purpose of helping me out, as much as they could, of the trouble I was in. Stone was broken as acting senior cadet officer, and you, guilty of the same offense, were given his place. I hope you enjoyed it." Robert spoke warmly. "Look here, Drake, suppose you let me ask you a few questions. When you left your post that night was it to avoid reporting me? Would you have deliberately neglected your duty for me, or was it to benefit your own particular chums, Stone, Pete and Glass?" "I'd do more for them than for anybody else at the Academy." "Of course you would; I'd blame you if you wouldn't. But you wouldn't have done it for me alone, would you?" "I don't know--I'd got sick of reporting classmates. I hope I won't have to face that question again." "Drake, I wouldn't either have asked or expected you to do that for me. I didn't report myself because you didn't do it for me; I took my chance and was not reported. It was all right for Stone to report himself if he wanted to. As for being shoved into his position as acting senior cadet officer, that didn't amount to a hill of beans, and you know it. It was a very temporary matter, and it didn't make any difference to Stone or me or you or anybody else. At the same time I don't mind saying that I was sorry at the time I supplanted Stone. I'm also sorry you have seen fit to brood over this matter. I suppose I can get along without your friendship, though I was perfectly sincere in offering you mine." "Do you know who's going to have five stripes?" asked Robert sharply. "Why Stone, of course--I haven't seen the stripe list yet, but I don't imagine anybody else will be considered for that job." Without saying anything more, Robert took a newspaper clipping from his pocket and handed it to Farnum. Stonewell, who had been silent during the talk between his two classmates, now said, offering his hand to the latter, "I congratulate you, Farnum; I'm sure you'll have a good brigade; you may depend on my helping you to the best of my ability." Though Farnum was ordinarily a very self-contained young man, his eyes bulged when he saw himself gazetted as cadet commander. He hesitated for a moment, seemingly lost in perturbed thought; then turning to Stonewell, he took his hand and said, "Stone, this is very kind of you," and without another word passed out of the car. "Bob," said Stonewell rather sharply, "I have a request to make of you, and if you are the friend I take you to be you'll heed it. I want you to drop this matter of five stripes. You'll make a nuisance of yourself and will make me ridiculous. I want you to promise me you will not go around and tell people Farnum shouldn't have five stripes and that I should." "Stone, I boil over every time I think about it; I can't help it. It just makes me mad to see Farnum smirking and grinning, and usurping the place that belongs to you. But I don't think he'll enjoy his job, feeling in his heart that everybody knows he's an impostor. The idea of his saying to you 'this is very kind of you.' I'm disgusted!" "Well, Bob, don't think about him, and as you feel so strongly try to avoid talking about the matter. Let's talk of something else. The entire squad should arrive by to-morrow, and we ought to get in some good practice----" Here Stonewell received a violent interruption. A sudden lurch of the train threw a passing youth right on top of the two midshipmen. The young man immediately recovered himself and then broke out into a hearty peal of laughter. "I beg your pardon, I'd no idea I was so clumsy. You chaps are going to Annapolis, aren't you? So am I. I'm a midshipman." The speaker seemed to take it for granted that he was both important and interesting. He was full of apparent good nature and friendliness and wanted to talk; he was about nineteen years old, and was tall and strongly built. A great shock of tawny yellow hair surmounted a rather handsome, freckled, healthy face. He had a thick neck and his shoulders were heavy. His appearance betokened great good nature, and there were health, strength and quickness in every movement. "You don't look like a midshipman," said Robert shortly. "Oh," said the young man with a laugh, "I've only been one for twenty days; I was sworn in September first, and then got leave, a grandmother died and the estate had to be settled--ha, ha, ha,--any excuse would have done--but I'm going to go back to-day for football. I know something about the game, and expect to make the team from the start. My name is Henry Bligh. What are yours?" "Young man," said Stonewell, in forbidding tones, "after you've been a midshipman for a while you will notice that other midshipmen are a bit slow in proclaiming who they are to strangers in public places. You are excused." A blank expression spread itself over Mr. Bligh's face. He looked from Stonewell to Robert. Neither took any further notice of him, and in a hesitating way he walked to the rear of the car. "A bit fresh, isn't he, Stone?" smiled Robert. "Yes, Bob; like you and I were when we first came here, and like most midshipmen are at first. He's a well-built plebe, and looks like good football material. Well, here's old Annapolis once more--what a pleasure it is to get back to the old town." The train slowed down and stopped and the passengers impatiently crowded to the door, anxious to be off. "Hello," exclaimed Robert, "Farnum must be in a hurry; he's taken a carriage; I'm glad I'm not in a hurry, for I'm busted, as usual." Farnum had jumped into a carriage and gave directions to be driven to Bancroft Hall; on his arrival there he went immediately to the commandant. "I'm glad to see you, Mr. Farnum," said the commandant, greeting him warmly. "I suppose you've come back early for football practice?" "Yes, sir." Farnum paused for a moment and then began abruptly, "Captain, I have here a list of midshipmen which it is said you are to recommend as cadet officers. I am slated, according to this list, to be cadet commander. I wish permission to speak to you frankly about this." "Go ahead, Mr. Farnum. Those are the recommendations I shall submit to the superintendent within an hour. The list was not made public by me; it leaked out somehow; but I guess no harm has been done. But it will not be final until the superintendent approves it. He has just returned from leave, and so has not acted upon it." "Will you please tell me frankly why I am recommended to be cadet commander, and Mr. Stonewell is not?" "This is unusual, Mr. Farnum, but as you are recommended for the highest cadet rank I don't mind being perfectly frank. Mr. Stonewell is number one in your class, and in pretty nearly everything at the Academy. The summer cruise officers and the ordnance and seamanship and discipline officers have recommended that he be made cadet commander; and you were recommended pretty nearly unanimously to be the senior cadet lieutenant-commander. But last summer Mr. Stonewell committed a most serious breach of Academy regulations. He took French leave one night." "Is that the only reason he doesn't get five stripes, sir?" "Frankly, yes." "Then, sir, I must report I was also guilty, at the same time, of the same offense. Mr. Stonewell and all the others of the party, except myself, reported themselves for being absent, for the purpose of helping Mr. Drake. I didn't at the time feel called upon to do so, though I have since keenly wished I had. You can see, sir, it will be impossible for me to hold five stripes with any degree of self-respect. My classmates know all the circumstances. I would feel that I was an impostor and my classmates would have contempt for me. I could never have the respect nor exert the moral authority that should go with five stripes." "Mr. Farnum, I'm entirely surprised. You should have reported yourself last summer." "Yes, sir, but as I didn't do so then I must now." "Of course; however questionable your notions of last summer were your present action is commendable. Well, Mr. Farnum, you will hardly get five stripes, but, I assure you, you have my entire respect. Good-morning, sir," and Farnum was bowed out. "By George," reflected the commandant, "that young man has a sense of duty; he's pointed right. I shouldn't wonder but what it would be a good thing to call in the leading midshipmen of a class before cadet officers are assigned and talk it over with them. Well, I think the best thing I can do about this list is to recommend Stonewell for the brigade commander and Farnum for command of the first battalion. They will simply shift places and the other recommendations will not be disturbed." After making this change in the list the commandant left eyes. Gentlemen, Inspector Barnaby will do everything in his power to make sure that the club and its members are treated with tact, and discretion, isn't that right? Tom? Yes, yes, tact and discretion. I think, John, you might mention the possibility of opening the front line. Yes, of course. I don't see any reason why the front line hole shouldn't be open for play from Monday, do you, Barnaby? They're well away from the SOCs. I'll be playing over at Chedgrave Park for the time being. I think it's best if I keep my distance. I quite understand, John, and thanks for all your help. A word, Barnaby. I would appreciate it, Barnaby, if you would take my calls now and then. Yes, I'm sorry. You know, it's been a bit...hectic. Of course. Of course. Do you play golf, Tom? Perhaps you'd like to join me at Chedgrave Park? No, I do not play golf, John. I always thought it a bit unsporting, you know, hitting a stationary ball. The more's the pity. I play, sir. I want a daily progress report. I am disappointed in you. It was worth a try. Do you play? Yeah. (PHONE RINGS) Jones. Something's come up, sir. There isn't a trace of blood on Drinkwater's clubs or Tully's and Monkberry's. But there was an assault on Crisp's Folly a couple of years ago. A bloke called Derek Painter was attacked. Derek Painter? Yeah. Here's the interesting thing. The police were called by Harry Claypole, one of the village members. Who has no recollection of any incidents on the 13th hole. He's here now, in the cooler. TV: (CROWD CHEERS) (KNOCK ON DOOR) TV: 'Sam, now we've seen a demonstration of the lob wedge, 'could you now show us a chip and run? ' Morning. We'd like a word, Mr Claypole. Alone, if you don't mind. Watch out, Harry. Looks like they've caught up with you at last. How can I help you, Inspector? TV: (CROWD CHEERS) Have another go. To the left of the hole. To the left of the hole, Becky. OK, one more time. Hello, Colin! Yeah. I came across Mr Painter on Crisp's Folly. He was up by the periscope in some distress. He'd been attacked. So I got to the club house and phoned the police. Did Mr Painter ask you to phone the police? No, that was the thing. When I told him, he got quite shirty. Said there was no point wasting their time when he hadn't got a look at whoever it was. OK, so the police arrive. Yeah, they didn't speak to me. They were only here five minutes. Had a word with Mr Tunstall and Mr Painter and left. Mr Tunstall. Yeah, he sorted it out. He was quite annoyed about me phoning the police as well. Very concerned about the club's image, is Mr Tunstall. Anyway, next time I stayed well out of it. Next time? Er... Oh, nothing. Mr Claypole. Well, Jerry Drinkwater was playing Crisp's Folly last year. He come out the rough with a bloody nose. Said he walked into a tree. A few months after, Clyde Patchett was found in a bunker, doubled up, crying like a baby. Caught himself in a sensitive spot with his sand wedge, he said. Bit odd, though, him being a professional, and so on. Were either of the Fountain brothers around at the times of these events? You're never far from a Fountain at Whiteoaks. The Fountains seem to be an institution round here, don't they? Oh, yeah, the wonderful Mrs Fountain. The sun shines out of her, all right. As long as there's no money involved. Now, what can you mean by that? That woman's so tight, she squeaks when she walks. I did some work for her. Put a new concrete floor in that damned pigsty of hers. That was three years ago. She still owes me half the money. You should have told us about the attack on Mr Painter before. Yeah, I know, I know, but I didn't want to... Didn't want to cause any trouble for the club, did you? Look, there's a captain's committee meeting day after next. They're proposing new members. The captain, Mr Crisp, he's put me up for full membership. I'd be the first village member to become a full member. Mr Crisp thinks it's about time things were a bit more... democratic around here. Good for him. He's a good bloke - Mr Crisp. There's no side to him. He manages the White Lion Hotel in Causton, you know. You'll even find him serving behind the bar when they're short. So he understands people like me. He's got a bit of respect. Well, Mr Claypole, I hope you succeed. They have to vote unanimously, of course, but I'm well liked around here. I'm sure you are. All I've got to get through then is the president's dinner. Bit of an ordeal, is it? Oh, yes. Curtains if you pick up the wrong fork. Like teeing off with your putter, you're out. I'd be grateful if you didn't discuss this membership thing with anyone. It's not done to discuss things in public. Don't you worry, Mr Claypole. Your secret is safe with us. Thank you. We need to talk to this Derek Painter bloke. I'll get his details off the secretary. No need. I know how to get hold of him. Derek Painter was a friend. He used to be a member here. But he packed it in rather suddenly. Now, Jerry Drinkwater. Never keep a car longer than three years. Depreciation's terrible. Have you got a minute, please? Er... Er... Later would be better for me or tomorrow. No, now, please, Mr Drinkwater. (TOOTS HORN) (DOOR CLOSES) Are you just moving in, Mr Drinkwater, or moving out? Oh. Moving out. (PHONE RINGS) Place is getting too small. Growing family and so on. (MACHINE BEEPS) MRS DRINKWATER ON MACHINE: 'It's me. I've had enough. We're in Dorset. 'Don't follow us. I mean it, Jerry. 'Don't you dare try to speak to the children until my solicitor -' (TURNS OFF MACHINE) My wife's a bit depressed at the moment. It's the move. Mm. We want to talk about the day Alistair Kingslake was killed. For God's sake, I've told you everything. But you haven't, sir. You didn't tell us about the bet you had on with Alistair Kingslake. Bet? What bet? Mr Drinkwater, if I suspect from this moment on that you are telling me something that is less than the complete truth, Jones here will handcuff you, take you to Causton Police station and charge you with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Are we clear? Now, look - Are we clear about that? OK, all right. It was a few quid, that's all. 500. If you say so. And he accused you of cheating, didn't he? As good as. The nerve of the man. But you did cheat, Mr Drinkwater, didn't you? Now, just you hold your horses. Just you hold on. OK, all right. I told him I'd got out of the bunker in one. I'm ashamed to say it was a lie. I've never done anything like that before in my life. Never. But I was sick to death of Kingslake's bullying, sick of him bullying me with his damned money. So you doubled the bet on Crisp's Folly. Yes. A grand. What an idiot. There was no way I could pay him if I lost, but if I won, well... ..the pleasure of taking a thousand smackers off Kingslake... That man hated losing, believe me. So what happened? His tee shot was in the trees. Gone. The next thing I knew, there's his ball in the middle of the fairway. So you thought he'd cheated. Yes, it was impossible. I went after him to tell him what I thought of him. There he was... lying there. Body all twisted. I didn't kill him, I swear and I didn't kill Ed Monkberry. I know you didn't kill Ed Monkberry because you were visiting Eileen Fountain, Mr Drinkwater, at the time, weren't you? Was I? Yes, you were. Until you saw me. What were you doing there? Oh, catering committee stuff. Deadly dull. (CLICKS HANDCUFFS) I... I had an arrangement with Mrs Fountain, a private arrangement. (SNAPS HANDCUFFS SHUT) She was good enough to lend me a small sum of money... to tide me over. I was paying her back. You were borrowing money from Eileen Fountain? Well, I've known Mrs Fountain for years. She's been very kind. It was just to tide me over... so I could keep on playing golf. I've lost everything else, you see. Now that's gone as well, I suppose. Want to buy some clubs? We decided it was time we got more active, didn't we, Tom? Yes, we did, absolutely. We were thinking maybe badminton. So we came along for a look. Badminton or golf. Golf? Joyce has a natural swing. Aren't you investigating those terrible murders at Whiteoaks? Yes, I am, for my sins. Funnily enough, we were thinking of joining Whiteoaks at one point. Oh, wait a minute. Aren't you two members? Erm...not any more. Don't talk to me about that place. Oh, what happened? You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. No, of course you don't. No, I want to. Tom might as well know. I had a problem with gambling. That's the long and the short of it. The one thing that kept me out of trouble was golf. Until I joined Whiteoaks. Does gambling go on up there? Oh, it certainly does. I was down a couple of grand with nothing but change in my pocket. So I was pointed in the direction of someone who could help. Was that someone, by any chance, Eileen Fountain? That's right. The steward. Turns out she's the club's unofficial banker. Who pointed you in her direction? Will Tunstall. He was the one I owed money to. I should have listened to Martin Crisp. You've probably heard his story. Losing that lovely house. Yes, after the membership committee voted us in, Martin Crisp took me to one side and warned me about the gambling element. So you borrowed money from Eileen Fountain to pay off your gambling debts to Will Tunstall. Keeping it in the family, he called it. And I fell a couple of weeks behind with the payments. One day I find myself in the trees on Crisp's Folly and Colin, Eileen Fountain's great lump of a son, looms out of nowhere and roughs me up. What? Derek, you should have come to me. Anyway, we put our heads together and managed Show him where he can put his stuff? - That's nice, thank you. - Good night, Nancy. Hey, listen, I like to have a lot of fresh fruit around and chocolate chips in my pancakes. Okay? - Write it so you don't forget. - Show him the room. She's Mom now, so... - Good night, Mom. - Good night, Brennan. - Good night, Mr. Doback. - Good night, Brennan. So just a few basic rules about the house. If there's any foods that you like I suggest you put your name on them, or they will be thrown out. By me. House was built in 1825 by General Custer. I wanna show you this room. Hold up. - You see this room? - Yeah. Okay, here's the deal. This is my office and my beat laboratory. Okay? And this is the one rule of the house: Don't ever, ever, ever touch my drum set. - You understand? - Don't go in there and... - No touching! - All right! There. I was at about six there. You don't wanna see me go to 10. Get your shit. We're going to my room. Honey? I just found a chain of islands that we can sail to after New Zealand. That's wonderful. You know, I've been meaning to ask you... Why is it that Dale never left? Well, Dale has always coasted off my accomplishments. I mean, he left college his junior year because he said he wanted to join the family business. - But you're a medical doctor. - Believe me, I've told him that. But he just always says, "It's all about who you know." I don't know where he got this sense of entitlement. Maybe it was his mother passing. What about Brennan? From what you've told me his younger brother Derek's been quite successful. Well, certainly when his father and I split, that was difficult for him. And this one time, when Brennan was 17 and Derek was 14 and Brennan decided to enter a talent show. He sang a song from an old pirate musical. But Derek got his football buddies to replace the choir and sing: "Brennan has a mangina." Brennan has a mangina Brennan has a mangina Finally, the audience and even some of the nastier parents started singing: "Brennan has a mangina." And I have to admit, for a little while, I sort of joined in as well. From that day on, Brennan never sang again. Derek went on to win the contest by lip-synching "Ice Ice Baby." - Oh, that's a great song. - It is. - Hey, you awake? - Yeah. I just want you to know I hate you. So does my dad. Well, that's fine. Because guess what. I hate you too. And this house sucks ass. Well, the only reason you're living here is because me and my dad decided that your mom was really hot and maybe we should just both bang her. And we'll put up with the retard in the meantime. - Who's the retard? - You. - Hey, y'all don't say that. - Shut up. You'll wake up my dad and get me grounded. Just shut up. You and your mom are hillbillies. - This is a house of learned doctors. - You're not a doctor. You're a big, fat, curly-headed fuck. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - I'm a curly-headed fuck? - Yeah. You better not go to sleep. As soon as your eyes shut, I'm gonna punch you square in the face. I hope you stay still when you sleep because I'm putting a rat trap between your legs. I'm gonna take a pillowcase and fill it full of bars of soap and beat the shit out of you. I want you out of my fucking house. No way, kemosabe. This is my house now. How do you like The Gilded Lady? I wish we could retire right now. Won't be long. Oh, God! It's cold! Hey! Is anyone listening? Help! Fuck you, Dale! Fuck you! - obviously you guys are hot. You know? Just revealed her cover. I was like, "Wow, this is hot." A little girl-on-girl. A little heaven, a little hell. - Hey. - Hey. - Why you so sweaty? - I was watching Cops. Not supposed to have your feet on the couch. Hey, man. Did you touch my drum set? - Nope. - It's just weird because seems like someone definitely touched my drum set. Yeah, that is weird. Because I didn't touch them. - Hey! Did you touch my drum set? - Hey, knock it off! I know you touched my drumstick, because the left one has a chip in it. You fucking crazy, man? You sound insane, do you realize that? You should be medicated. Fuck you, Brennan. I know you touched my drum set. I wanna hear that dirty mouth admit it. You get out of my face, or I'm gonna roundhouse your ass. You swear on your mom's life that you didn't touch it! I don't swear to shit! That's because you fucking touched my drum set because I know Cops doesn't start till 4. - Where are you going? - I'm going upstairs. Because I'm gonna put my nut sack on your drum set. Okay? Don't you do that. I am warning you right now: If you touch my drums, I will stab you in the neck with a knife! If you even go in the room, I will go ape-shit, you hear me? Don't wanna miss a spot. John Bonham's playing "Moby Dick" for real! I swear to God. I swear to God! No! I warned you. There's one rule in the house, and you broke it! I didn't touch your damn drum set! I'm pre-diabetic! You fucking fucker! I'm gonna rub my balls on your mom's face! Come back here! I'll kill you! You son of a bitch! Your drum set's a whore! I teabagged your fucking drum set! Well, my drum set's a guy, so that makes you gay, you fucker! I'll kill you! I think it's gonna go generic soon, okay? - Line three. - Oh, thanks, Miles. Yeah. Jules? Wait, what's wrong? - Back! - You touched my drum set, you fucker! Stop it! Stop it! - Rape! Rape! Rape! - Stop it! Stop! Stop. - Stay out of this, Nancy! - Stop it, you guys. - Oh, my God, you're hurting him! - No, Nancy! Cinnamon! Stop it! My mom is being eaten by a dog, there's nothing I can do! - No, a story has a... - Excuse me. Dr. Doback, the phone's for you. I think it's urgent. Hello? Robert, they're like animals! I can't stop them! Stop screaming. Please. I'm on my way. There seems to be some savage fight going on between my son and stepson, so I... Family issues, huh? I don't believe in talking about people's personal lives behind their back. You know nobody likes you, right? Rape! Rape! Rape! What's going on? Robert! They won't... They won't... - Stop it! Stop it! - Dale, what...? - Stay out of it, Dad! - Stop it! What the fucking fuck? Someone got some air. Snap. - I still hate you. - Still hate you. Such power. It's raw power. What are you doing? It's Shark Week. Okay, here's the deal: Number one, you will fix the fucking drywall now. Number two, you have one month to find jobs or you're out on your asses. I will arrange interviews for Monday, and you will go! Dad, why are you talking to me like this? I'm your son. I'm not buying that crap anymore. Today I saw my own son use a bicycle as a weapon. You yelled "rape" at the top of your lungs. Mom, I honestly thought I was gonna be raped for a second. He had the craziest look in his eyes. And at one point he said, "Let's get it on." That was about the fighting. I'm so not a raper. I didn't touch your drum set, okay? I witnessed with my eyes your testicles touching my drum set. All right, that's it! That's it! You two guys leave me no choice. No television for a week. - What? ! - What? ! - We are so serious, guys. - You're fucking high! Are you out of your mind? This goes in Robert's wall safe and it's gonna stay there. - No! - Okay. - This house is a fucking prison! - On planet Bullshit! In the galaxy of This Sucks Camel Dicks! Hi! Aunt Carol. Aunt Carol. - Hey. - You can't catch me. I gotcha. I gotcha. Aunt Carol's on fire! I don't know where you learned it. - Well, there's lots more where that... - My God. - Oh, no. What happened? - What the...? Oh, my God. Maybe Dale left the back door open and raccoons got in. Nancy? Is this your purse in the freezer? Yes. It's Brennan. He sleepwalks and he always puts my purse in the freezer. Dale sleepwalks too. - Are you kidding me? - I'm not. Look in the oven. - What's in the...? Couch pillows? - Couch pillows. Yeah, Dale. Come on. - It's okay. - It's really hard. It's gonna be fine. They're gonna get jobs, they'll be gone in a month. A month. Guys. - Guys. Guys! - I'll kill you, Leonard Nimoy. The clown has no penis. What kind of dreams are you guys having? Hey, it's 12:30. Brennan, your brother's coming today, so get up. - Today? - Yep. - Shit. - What's your problem? My little brother's even a bigger asshole than you are. All right, let's really nail it this time. Here we go. A one, a two, a one, two, three, four. All right, Tommy, you're the oldest. I'm counting on you. Come on. Nice vibrato, buddy. All right, all right, Alice, let's go. Flat. It's so flat. I can't even... You don't even look good while you're singing. The worst thing I've ever heard. This is $ 1200 a week for voice lessons, and this is what I get? Okay, I'm gonna save it with this solo. I'm Derek And I can sing high like this And I can sing high Jesus! We were so sad you guys couldn't come to the wedding. - But we completely understand. - Yeah. You were busy fishing with Mark Cuban. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, not just the Cubes but we had Chris Daughtry, Jeff Probst, super-chef Bobby Flay. It was insane. I mean, it was almost too much. My God, that's impressive. Yeah, we were down in the Gulf, fishing bonito. Robert, have you ever been down to the Gulf on the bonito run? Always wanted to. I hear it's amazing. - It is. It's gorgeous. - Are bonito fish big? What? Don't interrupt when he's telling a story. - It's fine, Robert. - I was asking about the story. - What's this guy's deal? - I don't know, son. It's okay. Well, Dale, they are what's called a trophy fish. So, yeah, they're pretty big. I'm sorry. Anyway... Oh, God, I'm sorry, I forget where my story was going. Damn it, Dale. - No... - Robert. - What? - What? I asked him. No, he can join in, Robert. It's really okay. Well, I asked him twice not to interrupt. Gang, don't be mad at Dale for ruining the story. And possibly the evening. It's totally fine. I have a lot more stories. - Derek, that you do. That you do. - Yeah. - Guilty as charged with the stories. - Oh, God, you're impressive. Come on. I love talking to you. From across the room, I feel like we have a thing. You and me, man. You're my new stepdad. You're unbelievable. - I never heard that laugh before. - Dad, why are you acting so weird? Oh, hey, by the way, guys, where's my bro, Brennan? You're right about your brother. Total dick. Told you. You know what? I still hate you but you got a pretty awesome collection of nudie mags. Yeah, I got them from the '70s, '80s and '90s. It's like masturbating in a time machine. Anyway, so I figure by the summer of 2010, we can probably set sail. But I think about it every day of my life. Let me ask you this, Bob, why wait two years? - Well, I gotta make more money. - Okay, look. I hear you, believe me. But what if I were to tell you that I could sell this house for 30 percent above market? - That'd be great. Could you do it? - Yeah. In a heartbeat, Robby. Look, I got my real-estate license a few years back for shits and gigs. I'd do it for four-fifths commish because you know what really gets my dick hard? Helping out my friends. That'd be fantastic. That'd be fanta... Oh, my God. - No, it would be kick-ass, bro. - Oh, man. Right there. What about Dale and Brennan? Because they haven't even gotten jobs yet. God, change the record. Sweet! Robert. Don't talk to me like that in front of my son. Oh, come on. We're talking about our dream, the boat. Come on. Yeah, it's our dream, but I think it all needs to be done in good time. I'm just saying give it some thought, okay? That's it. That's all I'm saying. Holy shit, triplets. It's true, three's company. - It shows tons of bush. - Hey, hey, careful. Careful with that. You're crinkling. That's a collector's item. It's worth a lot of money. What's up, faggots? What's up, man? What, you're not gonna come down, say hi to me? Hi, Derek. Whoa, calm down, man. I'm just joking. You guys, I really like your guys' setup up here. What is your problem, man? My problem? I don't know. I don't have a problem, Dale. Actually, I have the opposite of a problem: I made over 550 K last year. How much did you make? - It's not about money. - No, it's not about money. Well, for me, it's a little bit about money and I made that much money last year. I am the VP of the biggest executive-helicopter-leasing company on the Western Seaboard. Okay? I haven't had a carb since 2004. Check these out. See these? See these boys? This is what I live with. Every day I lather this up with Kiehl's in the shower. You wanna touch this shit? You wanna touch these bad boys? Sorry, not gonna happen. Is there something you want? I promised Mom I'd offer you a job. I told her it'd count as her Christmas present, so... No. I'm never gonna work for you. Fine. I don't care. The truth is I just smoked a J out in my car a few minutes ago so feeling a little spacy. Know what I'm say...? What's up with you, man? What you looking at, kemosabe? You... You wanna punch me right now. You wanna punch me right now, but you won't. You wanna punch me too? You guys both look like you might wanna hit me in the face. You do, I can tell. Well, why don't you do it? Why don't you punch me in the face? Punch me in the fucking face! - Oh, shit. - Oh, my shoulder! That was awesome. Mom! Mom! Derek, know what's always good for shoulder pain? - What? - If you lick my butthole. Snap! - Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Bobby. - Sure. Aside from that retard trying to punch me, it was a pretty good evening. - It was our pleasure, son. - Why are you calling him that? Oh, don't, don't. Bye, kids. I'll check out that stock you recommended, Tommy. Excuse me. - Hi. I'm Alice, I'm Derek's wife. - Hi. Is it true you struck Derek in the face and he fell from the tree house? Yeah. He asked me to. Oh, that's the most amazing thing I've ever heard. I want you to know that tonight I am gonna pleasure myself to the image of you doing that to Derek. You know what I mean? Masturbate. I am. Oh, Dale. You are something. You are something. You're something too. I wanna roll you into a little ball and shove you up my vagina. You could just live there. It's warm and it's cozy. In your vagina? I wanna walk around with you in there and just know that whenever I feel a little tickle or scratch that it's just your hair up my vagina. Please, just do it for me. What's happening? Kiss me. I know. I know. It's too much. It's too much. I hate my life, Dale. Dale, I hate my life! I have nobody to talk to. - Well, you seemed okay at the di... - Please. Alice! Honey, come on! Dane Cook, pay-per-view, 20 minutes. Let's go! Coming, honey! I'm just talking to Dale. This is so stupid. Call me. - I love you. - Okay. - Hey. What'd she want? - What? Nothing. Who's...? Who? Alice. We were just talking. Not... It was not about sex or anything. I can't believe you hit Derek. I know. Did you see the expression on his face? - That was cool. - Listen. I know that we started out as foe. But after that courageous act that you showed me against the one they call Derek maybe someday we could become friends. Friends who ride majestic, translucent steeds shooting flaming arrows across the Bridge of Hemdale. I would follow you into the mists of Avalon, if that's what you mean. Do you wanna see something cool that only three people have seen? Okay, open your eyes. See that black smudge right there on the blade? - Yeah. - Look at it closely. - Pretty recognizable signature. - No. Randy Jackson from American Idol. Why do you have Randy Jackson's autograph on a martial-arts weapon? I bumped into him and all I had was this sword and you're not gonna not get Randy Jackson's autograph. I would've done the exact same thing. Now, do you wanna see something really cool? - Of course. - Turn off the lights. Industrial-strength night-vision goggles. Holy Santa Claus shit. Can you imagine if we had these when we were 12? Even better. We got them when we're 40. You know what's amazing? They're not that noticeable on your face. - Right? - Yeah. I can't believe I've been living here for two weeks and I'm walking around this place thinking I've got a huge doucher for a stepbrother. Secretly, you're not a doucher. Let's play a game, all right? On the count of three, name your favorite dinosaur. Don't even think about it, just name it. Ready? One, two, three. - Velociraptor. - Velociraptor. Favorite non-pornographic magazine to masturbate to. - Good Housekeeping. - Good Housekeeping. If you were a chick, who's the one guy you'd sleep with? - John Stamos. - John Stamos. - What? - Did we just become best friends? Yep. Do you wanna go do karate in the garage? Yup! - Yeah! - Yeah! I think they're starting to like each other. I got a really bad feeling about this. - Sword fight! - I know. Sword fight! - Exactly the same! - I know! That's so weird. Now you're in trouble. - Come on! - No! They're betting against you, but you can do it! - Yeah! - Yeah! Is this a bad time? What the hell's going on? Ma, Mr. Doback, okay, Dale and I were just... Please, stop calling me Mr. Doback. Sorry. Okay. Mom, Doback we think it would be very prudent... - Can we turn our beds into bunk beds? - Yes. Why are you guys so sweaty? We've already figured out how. The beds match up perfectly. It would give us so much extra space in our room to do activities. Please say yes. You don't need our permission to build bunk beds. You're adults. You can do what you want. So? I'm not making myself clear. I don't give a fuck. Now, you both have several interviews tomorrow. I would think you'd be focused on that and not building bunk beds. - So? - So? - We can? No? - Yes. Yes, you can make bunk beds. - I knew it. - Okay. You are not gonna regret this. We'll get so much more activities done. This is the funnest night ever! This is so scary. - How you doing over there? - Really good. Okay. Does your son know anything about carpentry? No, not a th... Did I hear a drill? - Dale! Dale, no power tools! - Power tools. - What? - No power tools! - No, I forgot, I have to brush my teeth. - That is not your toothbrush. Oh, okay. Well, I'm all done anyway. - We did it. - We did it! It looks amazing! Look at that! That looks like what you'd buy from a store! - Should've been a bunk bed all along. - Look at this space. - We could do aerobics in here. - So many activities! - Do step class. - It's making my head spin how many activities we can do. - Play Army men. - Yeah. - Come on. Hey, I never asked you. Do you like guacamole? Oh, Brennan! Oh, God! Brennan! Brennan! Dad. Nancy. It's bad. It's so bad. There's blood everywhere. The bunk beds were a terrible idea. Why'd you let us do that? It's so bad! How would you describe that? - It's not so bad. - Right. See? Put your beds back. Rumpus time is over. You got a big day tomorrow. You need your eight hours. And although she was 88 years old, she never stopped believing. It's 8:20 in the a.m. Coming up next, a recent study by the American Council... Look at her. She's hot. Okay, guys, this is it. Good luck. Don't be late. Dad, I need to borrow some clothes for the interview since I don't have any fancy clothes. You go in my closet, take whatever you need. You guys gotta look sharp. This is the most important day of our lives. - Okay. - No pressure, no pressure. - All right? Relax. - Okay. I gotta go. I gotta go. This is your day. Remember that. You own it. - This is your one day! - All right. Mr. Huff, Mr. Jeener is ready for your interview. Actually, we'll be interviewing as a team. We're here to fuck shit up. Move it! Hey! Well, Brennan, you certainly have had a lot of jobs. I'm a bit of a spark plug. And, Human Resources lady, when I think... - You know, it's... Actually, it's Pam. - I'm sorry. - Well, Pan... - No, my name is Pam. - Are you saying Pan or Pam? - I'm saying Pam. Yeah, I'm sorry, who is this gentleman sitting behind you? Hello, Ms. Lady. I'm Dale. I'm Brennan's stepbrother and I think I might be able to help with the Pan-Pam dilemma. - Yeah, that'd be great. - Pam. - Pan. - Pam. - Pand. There's a D on the end. - With an M. - There's no D. It's Pam. - It's like "comb," except P-A-N-M. - N-N. There's two N's. - Two M's. That was the confusion. No, there's just one M. What do you say we interview you? All right. Yes, that's a sometimes-useful exercise. Please put your hand down. Go ahead. How much money do you make a year before taxes? Okay, I'm actually not comfortable answering that. - Come on! - We're doing the interview, not you. Here's a shot out of a cannon: Oprah, Barbara Walters, your wife. You gotta fuck one, marry one, kill one. Go! I think we're done here. Thank you. Mr. Huff, under your references, you listed Dale Doback which I know is this gentleman, but you also listed "Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior." - Yeah. Yeah, we are looking for people we can contact. We wanna tell you the stuff we're not good at. - Our weaknesses. - So we're clear up front. - Okay. - We're not generally comfortable in an office setting, I would say. - I get cooped up. I won't go into an office that's ever been used before. I am no good before 11 a.m. I also get headaches from computers, so I can't be around them too long. I take stuff. I need someone to go up and down with me in the elevator. I have a weakness for sweets. Other weaknesses? We're slow learners and we're not particularly good listeners. - That'll be a huge problem. - We're also slow learners. First of all, I needed someone to work... Wait, shut your mouth. Shut your mouth. I think we've had enough... - Shush up for one second. - Shut your mouth. - Wait, shut your mouth. - I'm sorry, what did you just say? - You're just coming off stupid. - I'm coming off stupid? You're wearing tuxedos to a job that requires you to clean bathrooms. - Please leave this office, we're done. - Do we get any sort of souvenir? Get out of my office! I'm looking to hire guys I don't mind hanging out with for 12 hours a day. You guys seem like cool guys. Got hair similar to mine, you wear tuxedos to the interview. That's funny, it's ironic. I get that. Underplaying the whole formality of it. I think that's funny as hell. So let's do this, you know? You guys are hired. You're in. Unless you're the weirdest guys ever and I don't see it. Great. - Was that a fart? - I don't know. I can taste it. On my tongue. Okay, I'll be honest with you. I did fart. Is that onion? Onion and... Onion and ketchup. - It stinks. And this is a small room. - Shit. Okay, now the tuxedos seem kind of fucked up. God. We were so close. So, what do we do for jobs? Is your dad really gonna kick us out? Listen, don't worry about my dad. Got him sewn up. We've gotta start thinking bigger, though, Brennan. Listen, what are you really good at? Singing. I'm a world-class singer. See? Right there, that's an amazing skill. Now, what am I good at? I can shred on the drums and I'm a marketing wiz. Put all that together, what do you get? - I don't know, a band? - No, that's been done before. Even better: we are gonna start an international entertainment company. The biggest and the best. And we're gonna call it Prestige Worldwide. That sounds so cool. I feel like a lightning bolt hit the tip of my penis. Yeah. Yeah. We're brothers. This is why we met. - To form this alliance, right? - Right? That's why our parents met, so this idea could happen. - Okay, what do we do? - We get to work. And we hit the beat laboratory right now. Let's go. - What? - Wait. What time is it? - 4:30. - 4:30. 4:32. - I can't go down Whitworth right now. - Okay. We should go this way. - What's up? - Chris Gardocki. - What? - He gets in my face and I just don't wanna deal with the hassle now. - Are you this scared? - Can we please go the long way? - Down Cutler? - Yeah. But that's 45 minutes. You're gonna shame me into doing this. - You sound stupid. - You'll be sorry. Okay, I'm stupid. Oh, man. Oh, God, there they are. Oh, my God, is that Dale Doback? - Let's make him lick dog shit. - Yeah. Hey, fag-stick. Long time, no see. Is that your boyfriend? Is that your butt buddy? Look, Mr. Gardocki, just leave me alone, will you? Shut your mouth, esé. You guys just go back and have fun on your jungle gym, okay? Does butt buddy have a name? If you're referring to me as butt buddy, yes, I do have a name. It's Brennan Huff. If you don't come over here and lick that white dog shit I'm gonna plow into your nose with my fist. - I'm not licking any white dog shit. - I'll lick the shit if you leave us alone. Dale, you're not licking dog shit, okay? They're kids. - Brennan, it's just dog shit. - It's ridiculous! - Hello, how are...? - Oh, God! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Get them! So maybe you don't go down that way anymore. Maybe you go the long way home. That's what we talked about. We'll take the long way home. You know in that one scene in The Wizard of Oz when the flying monkeys pull apart the Scarecrow? That's what it was like. - It's okay, it's okay. - I'm so sorry. Is my dad mad about the stuff that happened? Robert was very upset, yes. He knows that you interviewed as a team. And he heard about the fart. - Oh, he did? - Yeah. You just couldn't hold it, or you...? - No. I thought it was gonna be silent. - It was not silent. Just kept going, and it made a sound. It was embarrassing. It got louder. So listen, Bobby, I'll get those keys made tomorrow and then we'll start setting up times. - Thank you. - Hi, Mom. - Hi. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Always nice to see you. - You too. Hey, guys. Looks like your free ride's over, huh? Have fun living on the streets. Okay, cool. Good chatting, you guys. Bye, Mom. - Bye. - See you, buddy. What was he doing here? We're putting the house on the market. - Where are we moving? - Is the house haunted? Nancy and I are retiring and sailing around the world on my boat. We are living the dream. Well, what about us? I'm sorry. Robert... We thought that you should take responsibility for your own lives. This is the exciting part: We're going to put enough money in your accounts for a security deposit on an apartment. What's this all about? More than just money, we're gonna get you another kind of support as well. You're both gonna see therapists. Nancy thinks it'll help. - Guys, that's nonnegotiable. - Hold on. We're not going on the boat Derek's selling the house, we have to go to therapy? - What the fuck happened? - Hey! Look, I know this seems really, really sudden and just sort of unfair and cruel and... - But it's nonnegotiable. - But it's nonnegotiable. I got a bellyful of white dog crap in me and now you lay this shit on me? You're adults. It's time you started acting like adults. - Mom. - I'm not backing down, Brennan. Don't even try. I know it seems hard, but it's the best thing for both of you. We do it because we love you. Dad, I'm doing this because I love you: fuck you. - Anything else? - No. Bon voyage! Have a great time! Hey, what's up, Derek? Yeah. - Know what? - Look what I got. I'm sitting here thinking we finally got a family together here and now it's about to be taken away because they think we're losers. - Because they don't understand us? - Yeah. They don't get that this lifestyle is a choice. And all they think about is that stupid boat. I swear, I'm so pissed off at my mom. As soon as she is of age, I'm putting her in a home. We have got to get Prestige Worldwide going. It's the thing that's gonna save this family. I was thinking we should have a investor presentation like on The Apprentice. We gotta start with some capital somewhere. Here's the thing, though: If we're gonna start a huge multinational corporation I have to hear you sing. Can't you just trust that I'm a really, really good singer? Just one song, so I know what your voice sounds like. Yeah, yeah. I'll just do it. No big deal. I'll just dive into it and just start singing. Jesus, my heart is beating so fast right now. Okay, just do it. Just do it. Just... You know, I don't know. I didn't sing too loud, because I don't wanna wake up Robert and Nancy. My throat's sore. I've had a sore throat for a month and a half. And this is not an acoustic environment that's suitable to request this from me. You gotta know, I'm not just some guy. Brennan, that is the voice of an angel. Brennan, I can't even make eye contact with you right now. Your voice is like a combination of Fergie and Jesus. Why can't you do that in front of people? Are you messing with me right now? It's me, Dale. You're good. - I know. - This is gonna sound weird but for a second, I think you took on the shape of a unicorn. I felt like I was hovering above my own body watching myself sing. Now, let's move on to other business. First thing tomorrow, we gotta get cracking on this investor presentation. And guess what else. This just came to me. - We're making a music video. - Yeah! What do we do about Derek and the house? Don't worry about him. Oh, it's a great "nabe." Frank Gifford used to live down the block. - The Giff? - Yeah, the Giff. Right down the block. I'm getting a really good feeling about this. I am so glad. You get us that 10-year interest-only loan, we got a deal. Hey, fuckers! Welcome to the neighborhood! - My name is Craig. - The neighbor is a Nazi? You guys ever need fertilizer, I've got a lot of it. Close to 80 tons. Hey, folks! How you doing? You're gonna love this neighborhood. Every single house here recycles. - Okay, we're done here. - Yeah, okay. Hey, Derek, sprechen sie dick. Dale, I don't know how much you know about therapy but it usually starts by you telling me something about yourself. I work at a college as a janitor even though I'm smarter than most of the people there. Sometimes I see an equation written on a blackboard like half an equation, and I'll just figure it out. - Is this Good Will Hunting? - No. It sounds a lot like the plot of Good Will Hunting. Yeah. Anyway. My best friend is Ben Affleck... So I thought we'd begin talking about your parents' divorce. Okay. How old were you when they got divorced? - Fifteen. - That's a hard age. - Yes. Yeah. - Do you wanna talk about some of those feelings? - I love you. - Obviously, you don't know me. - I love you so much. Thank you. And I will take that as a feeling that you have of comfortability with me. It's more than comfortability. - I mean, I fucking love you. - Okay. I th... I'm just thinking about our life together. I feel like I'm walking on a cloud. My penis is tingling right now. - That is so off-putting. - You're not feeling this? In no way, shape or form do I feel any feelings of intimacy towards you in any way whatsoever. You got a really dope front lawn here. You and your homeboys can play on that. - You can just say "It looks good." - Yeah. No, that's how I talk. Oh, you got a really fresh entryway here. Pretty awesome. - show you the front of the house, which is actual... Will you vultures please give us some privacy? He just died last night. What is going on here? It was the asbestos in here, that's what did it! I've seen too many dead bodies. - I can't be in here. I can't. - No, no, no. - Not bad. - Eat shit, Derek. - Awesome B-day party, broheisens. - You the man, Derek. Okay, who's this from? TJ? Where are the rest of my gifts, dude? Totally joking around, TJ. All right. Oh, yes! Yes! Callaway 3-wood. - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah. - Bomb it down the fairway, bitches! - That's right. Hi, my name is Jim. Wanna suck my dick for money? - It's just me. Hi. - Oh, my God. What are you doing? This is the men's bathroom. Happy anniversary. - It's our second date. - What? Listen, I'm sick of being all coy and bashful, Dale. Okay? - We're in the bathroom. - This'll just take a minute. There's really little you can do about it. Let me just hop on. It's all slippery. Oh, my God! It's getting tingly. Something's gonna happen, Alice! Oh, we just had sex. - Just the way I imagined it. - I like you. I love you. - Stay golden, Ponyboy. I gotta pee. - Okay. Oh, my God. You're incredible. Say hello to my little friend. - Just kidding. It's from Scarface. - Scarface. Shut the fuck up! - Sweet-ass gift, Teej. - Yeah, not bad. - I got it all mapped out. - Okay. - I'm following your lead, though. - I'll get all eyes on us. - Okay. - Just like we planned. And then we'll drop the hammer. What were Dale and Brennan doing with my video camera, do you know? I have no idea. And frankly, I really don't care. So... I would like to say a few things. Derek, you are an outstanding young man, son. And I would like say that this is the image I have: That sometimes when I'm making love to your mother and I realize that this is where you came from, that I'm so moved that I talked to my lawyer, and not only are you going to be in my heart forever, but you're going to be in my will, young man. - Okay. Okay. - Okay? - Robert, that was fucking awesome. - Thank you. You got a lot of this, buddy. And you got a lot of these. Thank you. Everyone, if I could have your attention, please. For those of you who don't know me my name's Dale Doback. - Check. Check. I'm Robert's other son, the biological one. Check. Check. Probably wondering why we gathered you here tonight besides Derek's birthday. We got a special surprise for you, Derek, and everybody here... - Check, check. - Check. - Dale. No, please. - Don't interrupt them. - I'm begging you. - You wanna shut this down? - Just hold on. - Derek, for your birthday we thought we'd roll out a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity. Happy birthday, Derek. Music. Prestige Worldwide, wide, wide, wide. Prestige Worldwide. - The first word in entertainment. - First word. - Management. - Financial portfolios. - Insurance. - Computers. - Black leather gloves. - Research and development. Putting in the man-hours to study the science of what you need. Last week we put Liquid Paper on a bee and it died. - Security. - Security. - And... - And. - Possibly you. - Possibly you. - Oh, this is classic. This is... - We'd like to present the world premiere of Prestige Worldwide's first music video by our first act, Huff and Doback. - Roll it. - Roll it. Pay close attention, Dad. It's gonna look familiar. - This is... This is perfect. - Is that my boat? Yes, it is. What are you doing on my boat? The Niña, the Pinta The Santa María I'll do you in the bottom While you're drinking sangria Nachos and Lemonheads On my dad's boat You won't go down 'Cause my dick can float We sail around the world And go port to port Every time I come I produce a quart That is offensive. Brennan, Dale. I gotta have me my boats and ho's Deadliest Catch without the crabs We're almost out of gas Call the Arabs Pull up the anchor 'Cause we're leaving dry land Get below deck With a dick in your hand Boats and ho's Boats and ho's I gotta have me my boats and ho's Are you ready for some world-class vocalization? - Get a partner. - Wait a minute. - Who's steering the boat? - Dad, please shut up. Please shut up! Yeah! So big question is: Aside from the damage to the boat, which we will fix what'd you think of the presentation? Brennan, I think that what you did to Robert's boat was horrid. Having said that, I think that both of you boys showed a lot of enthusiasm and inventiveness. Yes. Thank you. You gotta be kidding me. They destroyed our dream and you're calling it inventive. - No, no, no. I didn't mean it like that. - Yes, you did. Come on, you did. It's gonna be four years, at least, before we can sail anywhere. - And you could care less, admit it. - I will not admit that because it is not true. - Oh, yeah. But, you know, I do think that you could show a little bit more attentiveness to your son and your stepson who obviously need you. It's true, Dr. Doback. You've been very cold and unsupportive of our dreams. You wrecked my fucking boat, you goon! Don't speak to my son like that. Your son's costing me $80,000. We could bicker about this all night, but what's done is done, Dad. - Are you guys gonna invest or not? - That's it! That's it! - What are you doing? - Grab the wheel! I can't believe you're being so stingy. - Robert, come down. - It's a simple business decision. You jackaloons! You're failures! Failures! And you're embarrassing yourself, you geriatric fuck! - Brennan. - Two things: You keep your liver-spotted hands off my beautiful mother. She's a saint! Then you sit down and you write Dale and Brennan a check for $ 10,000. Oh, stop it. Or I'm gonna shove one of those fake hearing devices so far up your ass... - Brennan! ...you can hear the sound of your small intestine as it produces shit! - All right, here we go. - Oh, my Lord. Somebody should've done this a long time ago, and I'm gonna do it. - What are you doing? - Robert. There are consequences for your actions. - No! Robert! - Dad! - This is not the answer. - You're next, mister. - You understand me? - Yes. - Certain behaviors... - Let go of me. ...will not be tolerated! - My ass is on fire! Wow, the tree looks great, Nancy. Really tasteful. Thank you, Dale. That's a very nice sweater you're wearing. It was my mom's. I took the shoulder pads out. Oh, and, Brennan? Denise called and she said she can't go out with you on New Year's Eve because she's not your girlfriend, she's your therapist. - Is that what she said? - Yeah. She's a rascal. Hey, Dad, Nancy? Would it be cool if Brennan and I opened just one present each since it's Christmas Eve? I'm gonna go down to the Cheesecake Factory, have a drink. But it's Christmas Eve. Merry Christmas. - Yes. - Yeah. I had my eye on one. I hope it's what I think it is. Oh, my God. Hulk Hands! Wait, Dale got Hulk Hands? Well, you reek of Scotch and cheesecake. You know tonight at the Cheesecake Factory was the happiest I've been in months. - Well, then I feel very sorry for you. - Well, just... Nancy, I don't know if I can ever forgive them for wrecking my boat. - Why are you giving up? - I'm not giving up. I'm not. - You are. You're giving up on our boys. - But they're 40. I don't care how old they are. They're still our children. Well, sometime it's got to matter how old they are. That's all we do, is... Oh, sweet Jesus. Oh, it... You know, they'll go back to bed. See? They're sleepwalking. No. No. See, back to bed. They'll be fine. Just nonsense. I'm gonna wake them up. - No. Why would you do such a thing? - Well, because it's... - Never, ever wake up a sleepwalker. - See, that's it. - We can't ever do anything. - No. But they could do real harm to themselves or others. - Oh, the Christmas presents. - No, guys... No, no, don't... - No. But... - I think we should take control. - It's always about them. - How do you propose to do that? - Oh, Jesus. - Whatever you do, don't wake them. They might do real harm to themselves or others. - Not everybody does know that. - Oh, the Christmas tree! Oh, not the... No, don't... All right, that's it! - I'm waking them up! - No! No! - Don't wake them up! - That's a myth! - Wake up, both of you. - Don't. I told you! I told you! Stop it! Don't hurt him! The pictures! Nancy! Robert! I mean, I was driving around with a buddy of mine, Topher. You guys remember Topher, right? Driving around, he has this brand-new Testarossa, right? We hit this four-point buck. Dead. Lying in the road. Long story short, we sue the state of Michigan. I end up getting 125 G's. Okay? You know what I spent that money on? Sniper rifle to hunt deer. Either way, the deers lose, my friends. Good riddance. Eat all the damn flowers, anyway. If you'll excuse me I think I'm going to go into the other room to check my hair. - Excuse me. - Sorry, everybody. If you'll excuse my space-cadet wife here. Let's just say the meds aren't helping. I'm kidding. Kidding. But not at all. I have to get some more gravy. - Oh, Dale, it's right there. - Oh, no. Shush up, Nancy. I have to get some more bread. What did I do to deserve that? What do any of us do to deserve anything? I pay enough taxes to support all these lazy goddamn liberals. Get off me! Off! Get back. Get back! Back! - What do you want? - Merry Christmas, darling. - Merry Christmas. - Oh, that was torture. I couldn't eat another bite of turkey without thinking of you inside of me. Come on, let's try something illegal. So, Tommy, what did you get for Christmas? Well, Santa brought me the Bowflex and $ 1000 in fresh-minted $50 bills. Wanna know what I got for Christmas? A crushed soul. - Alice, please. - Sing along, Santa. You know this song. What is that noise? It's... This is the ghost. - Just try to be quiet. Okay. - You're right. You're right. - We've got to be discreet. - All right. No, no! Oh, hey. Are you all still talking in here? What are you doing? Alice was moving a chair from the living room into the dining room for an extra chair and her back went out. And I just did the best thing, which is get right on the muscles... - Muscles. ...so they don't seize up. Just add some heat to it. Damn it, Dale, sit down. It's just a real deep, tight muscle. Hey, sweetie, can you grab me a beer? - I'll get you another Heineken. - Yeah. Merry Christmas. And how about you, Tiffany, what did you get for Christmas? I got this Mikimoto pearl necklace. But next year I'm gonna ask Santa for breast implants because I'm impatient with my body. Hey, Tiffany. Wanna know what I got? A crushed soul. You mentioned that earlier. - So good. - Oh, gosh! It's gone into a real bad spasm, so I put a yoga move on her. - grant me this one, because I was pretty wasted. So I put my lips around that breathalyzer and I saw those numerals pop up: 0.079. So I started going to Chad Michael Murray's Christmas party. I think that was the year. And just driving... I have to interrupt you. Robert, while the children are in the living room I think this would be a good time to make our announcement. - What's going on? - It's over. I'm gonna be moving in with my friend Jack Handle and Nancy found a townhouse in the city. What is this? What's happening? What Robert is trying to say is that we are getting a divorce. - Don't do this. - No. No! - I could've called this one. - No. - Yeah. - Is it our fault? - Is it because we were bad? - No. No. The main thing that Robert and I talked about is that we did not want you two to blame yourselves. - What can we do to fix it? - Dale, honey, are you okay? - Why are you calling him "honey"? - I cannot stress this enough: - It is not your fault. - Whose fault is it? - Fuck it, I wanna fucking know! - Let's cut the shit. - It is directly your fault. - Robert. You destroyed my boat. You beat me up in your sleep and worst of all, you made Nancy and I resent each other. - It is absolutely 150 percent your fault! - Of course it's their fault. They're the world's biggest dickheads, and they're living in your house. - Shut up, Derek. - I'm sorry, but that... Please don't cry like that. Please don't, Brennan. - Mommy! - Dale! I told you that they would feel completely to blame. - Oh, let's grow up. - I think I'm going to throw up. - I think I'm gonna throw up... - Don't throw up. ...all the nice dinner that I had. I'm gonna throw it up. - You're not gonna throw up. - He's gonna throw up. - Come on. - My God, he threw up. Oh, this is ugly. - Hey, guys. Guys. - This is not nice! - All right, dipshits. Right here. - Stop it, Derek. - One, two, three... - I don't want my picture taken now. Good luck, and remember, I need you out of this house by tomorrow. No exceptions. If there's anything you need, anything that you boys need you just give me a call. Okay? It's all right. Hey. Are you awake? Yeah. I can't believe we actually have to move out of this house. I know. I feel bad. Hey, you know, we don't have to whisper anymore. Mom and Dad aren't here. Yeah, but can we keep doing it, though? It helps me pretend that they are. You must feel just terrible. - I mean, I know I feel bad. - Yeah. But I can't imagine how you feel after my dad looked right at you and said it's all your fault that they broke up. That's funny, because my mom said: "If that curly-headed fuck Dale wasn't here everything would be perfect." - You take that back. - No way. It's your fault. You know what your problem is? You live in a fantasy land. You refuse to get a job and you don't know what it's like to work for something. You don't take responsibility for your actions. This is all your fault! Well, you're a mama's boy who's too chicken to sing in public! Yeah, that's right. Run away, little boy, because you know it's true. Just avoid everything. What are you doing? - Dale broke up Mom and Dad - Motherfucker! Dale broke up Mom and Dad Dale broke up Mom and Dad - Dale broke up Mom and... - Brennan! Get up, Brennan, I know you're faking. Get up! Get up! Brennan? It's just like Cold Case Files. It's just like Cold Case Files. It's just like Cold Case Files. People die every day. Give him a proper burial in an unmarked grave... - Brennan! You're alive! Oh, my God. - I know. I'm alive. - You were dead. I saw you die! - I was faking. I used ninja focus to slow my heart rate down. - What are you doing? - I'm burying you. - I'm alive. Brennan, I'm alive. - You're waking the neighbors! - Shut up! - No. No. - Now I'm gonna play your drum set. - Help me. Close your eyes. Let the dirt just shower over you. This is your fault. Oh, I'm exhausted. I'm gonna sleep good tonight. - Don't you touch my drums! - Zombie! Zombie! Zombie! Get off me, zombie. Get off. I'm late for school. I will kiss you right on the mouth, Kenny Rogers. - Just get off me. - Hey. So I guess it's really over. I'd say you trying to bury me alive pretty much did it. You know what I just realized? You've been the one dragging me down. Now I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna get a job and an apartment and then I'm gonna get Mom and Dr. Doback back together. I'm gonna be the hero, and you can suck on it. My life was perfect before you came here. Me and my dad had a perfect setup, and you wrecked it. Hey. We're no longer brothers. We never were. We were stepbrothers. - That was one of your best. - These balls fucking suck. All right. Well, well, well, look who's here, boys. Can you give me a job, please? TJ, get an office pool going. Give Ken-Doll Crotch here two weeks, tops. Dr. Angel Face, I just wanted to say thank you for meeting me on such short notice. - Don't call me Angel Face. - I apologize. I'm very alone right now, and the thing I wanna ask you to help me... To show me how I can be a grown-up. Do I carry my high-school diploma around? What do you do with your hair? What happens if there's inclement weather? Where do you...? What do you wear? Can you wash clothes in the dishwasher? I notice that there's a long gap in your job history and it said for 22 years you went Kerouac on everyone's ass? I'm gonna be honest with you. I really need a job. And I will take any position, as long as it doesn't involve having sex with old ladies for money or bear traps. - Those are my two bugaboos. - All right, got it. There's a catering business, there's a temp job open. And you get to play with fire. What do you want? This is my online-poker time. I'm ready to take on the Catalina Wine Mixer. Slow down there, Speed Racer. I know what it entails, and I'm ready to nail it. I want it, okay? I want the Catalina Wine Mixer. - Yo, yo. - Hey, D-man. - You tell him what's up? - I sure did. - Hey. - Hey. Your brother wants a shot at the Catalina Wine Mixer. I'm ready, walking tall. You're ready to run with the bulls? I've been earning and burning, snapping necks and cashing checks. Screw it, let's let him do it. It's a win-win for me because if you fuck up, Brennan... - Yeah? ...I get to fire your ass. But if you pull it off, I look like a genius to the board. - Okay? - I get it. Brennan, here's the thing. It's the Catalina fucking Wine Mixer, okay? Are you saying "pow"? What are you saying? It's the biggest helicopter-leasing event in the Western Hemisphere since 1997. - Why does he keep doing that? - I have to sell or lease at least 80 choppers to make my nut. And you mess with my nut, Brennan, Randy here is gonna eat your dick. Like Kobayashi. I've seen him do it. You've seen him eat a penis? It was in international waters, so they couldn't prosecute him. I tell you now, I'll nail it. I'll pull it off, okay? Wait a second, why do you want this so bad? Trying to get Mom and Dad back together or something? - Why do I want this? - Yeah. Because I wanna make bank, bro. I wanna get ass. And I wanna drive a Range Rover. Okay, well, you better, Brennan. This is the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer. Nancy. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? Well, Dale's working the function. Guys, this is supposed to be jicama, not bok choy. Sorry, folks. And I got an invitation from Brennan. Can you believe Brennan put all this together? And now here we all are in Catalina. - It's funny, huh? - Yeah, it's funny. - Hey, hey, hey. - Hey. Not bad. You're nailing it. - Thanks, Randy. That means a lot. - Yeah. I don't know what it is but I wanna deliver one of these right in your suck hole. - Is there anything I can do? - No. Not really. It's your face. Again, you're doing great, man. The Catalina Wine Mixer. We're all having a great time, having fun. You pulled it off. But if you don't change your face I'm gonna change it for you. - Okay. Okay. All I can do is take that in, consider it and I'll just do my best version of whatever I think that would be. I don't even hear you, your face is driving me nuts. - Thanks again, though. - Oh, tits. Hold on. - Hey. Hello, Catalina Wine Mixer. - Hi. How are you? We are Uptown Girl. We are California's preeminent 1980s Billy Joel cover band. "Piano Man"! What did I just say, man? All right, we don't play that so let's keep it in the '80s and let's keep it fun. You having a good time? I hope you are, because sometimes life can be tough. And I know that sometimes it's hard to "Keeping the Faith." You guys seem to be hitting it off. Oh, honey. Oh, my God, this is the greatest party. - Hello, Robert. - Way to go. - Brennan, this is fantastic. - Way to go. So impressed. - Hi, Dad. Hi, Nancy. - Hi, Dale. - Hey, Brennan. - It's good to see you. Thanks for hiring our catering company. Easy decision. You guys have a outstanding track record. - Just like old times, huh? - Right, it really is. You still have your night-vision goggles? No, no. No, I had to sell those to pay for car insurance. How about you? You still breaking boards or kicking holes in pumpkins or anything? No. But I did start taking baby aspirin to reduce my risk for heart attack. That makes sense. Gotta keep an eye on it, you know. - Knock off the sweets. - Thank you. It's a truly funny observation. Yeah. Dale, the empanadas are starting to sweat. Okay. I better run. - It's good to see you, Brennan. - You too. - Take care, be well. Take care, Dad. - Okay, buddy. - It's great to talk to him. - Yeah. I gotta go too. We should do this again. I think it was very constructive. - Maybe grab a bite to eat? - Sure. - Go to Outback Steakhouse. - Okay. I've grown very fond of that place. Thank you for coming. Great to see you. It was very nice to see you, Robert. I think Brennan organized this whole thing to get us back together. You have to excuse making you suffer in having loved a guy like me. Starting from the day we were married, sorry for the things I've done. Don't be kind of happy. I really want you to be happy, Park Min Sook. Oh! Have you seen the Goddess of Ethic's boyfriend? I saw them near our school. But... he looked really familiar. What kind of bastard is he? What do you mean, bastard? He's chic and scarily handsome. How do you know? Did you see him too? My mom bought it for me! Who's your mom? My mom will slap you! Do you want to get slapped? Hey! Hey, you'll hurt his neck! Hey! Isn't that Yoon Seung Jae? Isn't that Woo Young's uniform? Please... Four against one... I guess they're gangsters. However, getting involved in that fight... -Give it to us! -Ow! Hey! ...isn't a good idea. Are you the guardian of a student named Colin? I'm calling from the police station Those bastards started it first! What? You guys started to pick on me first! What he said is all a lie and these people ... were just walking by and helped me. What he said is correct.. I'm the witness. Did you win or lose? Let's say you won. Oh! He's our homeroom teacher's boyfriend! What? I'm sorry. He said a guardian needed to come. These are my friends. This is the leader, Dong Hyub and his worker, Sang Yub. Why are you stuck in this group? Didn't you notice how tiring my life is because I met your uncles? Dad! My son! What's wrong with your face? Which bastard did this to my son's face? Dad, him! It's you? YOU? ! -Ah Please.. - A student like you who doesn't study, do you know who I am? HUH? Who did that to your face? Him! What are you going to do about it? What the hell are you doing? You wanna die? Aigo! Please, Fathers! As an adult, I'm not allowed to hit a child. Who the hell are you? Are you the father of this kid? I'm the father of his friend. He's a son I've never gotten to hit And he's a friend that's like 10 friends to that son! If you know your son is precious, then you should know that someone else's son is just as precious. How dare you fling your hand? I should just break your wrist! I'm sorry, but for whom are you the guardian? For both. Are the three of you friends? Yes. Why... did you help us? We don't have a good relationship. I'm an adult and you guys are still young enough to need protection. Thank you. I have an appointment and have to leave. Stop smoking, you two! Alright. The police station? Now I really feel like I have a son. Is it a problem with his homeroom teacher? What'd you say? Did Colin get in trouble? I took care of it well. You heard about Meahri's wedding, right? You're not jealous? I wouldn't say jealous... Oh, so cold. It's surprising. Marriage isn't a simple thing. Yoon's more incredible for going ahead when he knows all there is to know about marriage. Attorney Choi must love Meahri a lot. Do people get married if they love each other? I love Seo Yi Soo a lot, too. Then should we also- One couple is getting a divorce and one couple is getting married. In the end, people get married or divorced to become happy. But, the way they get there is too different. Are you worried about Jeong Rok's wife? Don't worry about it. That couple won't break up. Why? If they were going to break up, there would be no reason for her to cut off all contact with him. In my opinion, the two of them are playing hide and seek. Or treasure hunting. I don't know why I'm more worried about the soon to be newlywed couple than I am about the divorcing couple. But I feel like it was worth being Meahri's teacher. I always tell students that they don't need to be good at everything. Just be good at the one thing they enjoy doing. She only loved one man to death. And in the end, her love came to fruition. All the same, I think I left my son to the wrong teacher. Are you disagreeing with my educational philosophy? What is it? It's not. Oh my! Why? Did you think it was someone you knew? What? Just someone I knew before... How'd you know him? Just someone I knew before... How'd you know him? A guy I dated before. For about half a year? He's really similar. But why were you surprised? Of course I'd be surprised. Then should I just say, "Hi! It's been awhile?" Why can't you do something so easy? Can you say that to the graduate student named Kim Eun Ji, with 245 shoe size? Of course! I mean, why do you have to act so surprised? Like the earth stopped revolving? Do you still have feelings for him? That's what this situation feels like. Then when you painted my house before, you were surprised when you saw a bug. Huh? Then were you surprised because you still had feelings for the bug? Seriously, you're so immature. There's no reason for you to get surprised! Ah! Seriously, so cheap. There's no reason for you to get surprised! Ah! Seriously, so cheap. Cheap? Don't you know that the #1 thing you shouldn't call a man is "cheap?" Don't you know the #1 thing you shouldn't ask a woman about is her past? See? You said "past." See? There is still something. It must've been a really deep relationship. Enough for your heart to still pound? My heart never pounded! Are you going to keep being critical? I was just surprised! Why are you getting angry? It's even more suspicious. Are you contacting him secretly by any chance? Ah really! I'm leaving! Where? To that man from your past? Sit. Where's the nail polish remover? Why? It's pretty. That's why. It's too pretty. Didn't you put it on for me to see? I've sufficiently seen that it's pretty. So let's erase it now. Before another bastard sees. Are you still talking about that? Wow! I used to call guys a "crazy bastard" when they said they wanted to keep their woman in their pocket. But I shouldn't have! These sexy fingernails, this pretty face, that amazing collarbone... I want only me to see. Do you want to go into my pocket or erase it? How old was he? Same as me. What'd the bastard do for a living? Why's he suddenly a bastard? I was going to say son of a b****, but I restrained myself. Because I'm in front of an Ethics teacher. He was an Oriental Doctor. Materialistic! What did you say? Really! If I'd known you were this kind of man, I would've reconsidered. Don't waste your energy! Even if you'd reconsidered 100 times, it still would've been me. You know the Blue Cat's opening game is this weekend, right? Did you make a donation? Why's the umpire taking care of that? Since Tae San's life is complicated lately. Did you pay or not? You don't have a knife, but you're a robber. Robber! If I need to, I'll get one. Who is it? Is it that man? Park Min Sook Have you been well? Yes. I can talk. This evening? Yes. I'll see you later. She wants to meet? Why? Men don't need to know. Why? What is it? We went to eat marinated crab. If Tae San finds out, I'm dead. You think Do Jin would be happy we went? Oh my, Director, you're here. It's been awhile. We came to have a bachelorette party. Our baby is getting married soon. Then we need to treat you well today. The 'water's' really good today. Should I make a booking? Otherwise, why do you think we paid so much to come here? So exciting! Look at you. I'm legally divorced and besides me, is anyone else married? Are you sure? It's special information I received from a b-boy who works here. Reservation under Park Min Sook, party of four. What else could it be? Why'd you say you were getting married tomorrow? You made this happen. Why are you just staying quiet? Because I'm used to it! Hong Se Ra. You...again! I really... Seo Yi Soo's not a woman who'd do this. This is all because of Pro Hong and Meahri! -What about Se Ra? -What about Meahri? The ink on the divorce papers hasn't even dried yet, but she went to a club? This woman... I should... Ah! Park Min Sook! You tried to catch me every day, right? I'll show you what it feels like to be caught! Let's go! Yah! I'm sorry. There's no room right now. What nonsense is this? Do you know what time it is? Just take two steps back. Even if we do this? The two of you can go in. As we planned, we'll go in first. You should've taken better care of yourselves. Ah! Seriously? Is your personality becoming like Do Jin because you're living together? I'm a complete wreck right now! Looks like you need some money to buy cigarettes. How much do you need? Let's make a toast. For those who are single now and for you, who's single for now, and for me who's single again. For us, cheers! Cheers! Nunas, we've got a booking for you. Hyungs, come inside! I'm hunting for the witch of Cheongdam-dong. Now I can only see you. I'm the main character of a romance comic from Samseong-dong. My season, is the rainy season. I'm a hot-blooded man from Dobok-dong. There is no forgiveness. I'm a gentleman from Samseong-dong. Alright. Now it's showtime! Preview. I swear to become Yoon Oppa's proud dream. I won't forget those who approved of this love. Do you want to get married to me? That's enough now. Are you mad? Shouldn't this be...serious? Maybe it's because I'm not anxious anymore. I feel weak and dizzy. Se Ra, what's wrong? Se Ra! Why don't you just step aside? It's not my ex-husband's business. I'm a divorcee and came to seduce another divorcee! I just like the divorcee in front of me right now! What the hell do you want me to do? Why would you do that? What'd I do? If you're stand out like that alone, what am I supposed to do? Am I pretty today? Seo Yi soo is pretty today. The last episode will air tomorrow. PETE: Well, I got some bad news on my end, guys. My old Gumpa Duke is headed into a retirement home. ANDRE: Aw! KEVIN: Oh, really? RUXIN: No! I like Gumpa Duke, and I hate all old people. I know. It's just a bummer. He's got some mental faculty issues, and Gumma Eve had no choice but to kind of put him in there. Everybody's getting old. Everybody. I mean, it's, like, staring us in the face at this point. Why are you so down about getting old? Eating salad. What's going on? Well, I'm just... I'm trying to eat healthier because I have a thing that I'm planning for. You going to the mall to get your glamour shots done? No. I have to get a colonoscopy for my life insurance. Oh, that's not a big deal. It's like getting an enema. They're easy. I'm not going to make fun of him getting a colonoscopy, especially since the amateur ones you've been giving him over the years have not been working. Oh. Look, here we are. Boo-oop! Does it ever get old, Ruxin? Pete-Kevin dick jokes? It does. Fine. I'll stop. I just need one last score. It's not a heist movie, Ruxin. You know, by the way, we should also put a moratorium on the Andre-dresses-bad jokes. ALL: No! Absolutely not. Timeless. Hope I see you again. I'm in room 117. Gumpa Duke? Hi. Hi. It's... Gumpa Duke, it's your grandson, Pete. Of course, I know. It's little Petey. How are you? Wait. You know who I am. Of course I do. What the hell's the matter with you? Come on. I-I... I don't know. I heard some things. I don't know. So, what brings you out here? I hadn't seen you in a while. I think it's been... Is it since Fourth of July, I think? Uncle Steve's barbecue. It was in August. Twenty-fifth of August, I think. Oh, yeah, you're right. Forgot about that. Still got that 2008 Crown Vic? I do. I... I, in fact, have that car. Maybe I'll get you a Triple A card for your birthday. March 28, isn't it? Yes. My... Grandpa, I got to say, you... You look great, you-you sound great, your memory's like a steel trap. I-I got to wonder what you're doing in here. Wendy. Hello. Oh, how beautiful you are. Oh, thank you. Oh. (muttering) Oh, my goodness. Oh! Oh, dear. (Wendy laughs) Oh, my goodness. Oh. (Wendy clears throat) Oh! Gumpa Duke! Gumpa Duke! Gumpa Duke, what are you...? What are you doing? This... You know, this is not Gumma Eve. This is not my wife? Oh. The hand kind of fell to the butt, and I was, like, "Oh, maybe it was a mistake," and then it moved over to the other butt cheek, and then he just scooped it and got under there. Really? I mean, he was getting frisky with some random older woman. Guys, it's sad. This guy is losing his faculties. Well, it is sad if it's Alzheimer's. But what do you mean? Well, I'm saying, there's a little bit of selective memory going on here, okay? He quoted my high school pole vault record to me. So it could be Alzheimer's or adultery. Look, all I'm saying is, I'm beginning to suspect that the only thing he's forgotten is that he's married. I just hate thinking about old people having sex, just like a dried-up potato stuffing its way into a crusty sock. Oh. TACO: Old people sex is quite beautiful. They know what they like, and no awkward abortion conversation. Getting old is just the worst! Now I have this colonoscopy appointment. You know, they tell you, you have to have someone drive you home because you're going to be heavily sedated? That's why I am your colonoscopy co-pilot. That's right. Just because they're going downtown on you doesn't mean that we can't go downtown, too. Plan the perfect day for the two of us. No. No, no, no. There's no perfect day. Pick you up, we'll go see a movie, okay? No. No, we're not going to see a movie, Andre. Go see Lincoln. I want to see Lincoln again. You want me to have a colonoscopy, and then go spend three and a half hours watching Daniel Day-Lewis play Abraham Lincoln? Okay, you know what? We'll just get Indian food, like I originally planned, and we won't go see the movie. What? I'm not doing that, either. All right, we'll just hang out in my car, I'll play you some tunes. I've actually made him my own mix tape, which is really... I'll walk. I'm gonna walk home. JENNY: Taco? (Taco sighs) What is all this stuff? Why do I come here for free food if you're not gonna get the stuff I ask for? You know what, Taco? I don't have time to worry about this. I am late picking Ellie up from gymnastics. Just grab something and go. Ooh! Fruit roll-up. No. Oh, you dirty girl. Edible underwear. They were a joke gift from a bachelorette party, Taco. So you keep them in the pantry? I could have eaten these. Where am I supposed to put them? It's not like I have a sex drawer, Taco. Where do you put all your dildos and your nipple clamps? Ugh. Just.. Just give them to me. You don't think Kevin would ever go for these, do you? He likes sex, and he likes food. It's kind of a no-brainer. Hmm. How are we doing here? How are you? I'm good, Kevin. I'm Dr. Whalen. Please call me Pete. I'm be... I'll... (Kevin laughs) That's good. What's that? That's good. Okay. Ruxin put you up to that? That's funny. I'm sorry. I don't... Is he here? Ruxin? I don't know who that is. He didn't tell you to tell me that your name was Pete just to mess with me? Uh, no. My name actually is-is Pete. Aah. All right. Anyway, the procedure takes a little under an hour. You've clearly already had your anesthesia. Uh, we'll be inserting a small tube with a camera at the end of it into the rectum, and then up through the colon, and, uh, later on today, you're going to experience some bloating, probably some mild flatulence. Normal. Um, that's probably why you're... why you're here. Can I see it? I'm so sorry. Can you see what? The camera tube? Oh. Camera tube? You know, I have to advise against that. Yeah. I want to see it. It is, in my professional opinion, that you shouldn't. In my non-professional opinion... Well, right there. How about if I brought over some food, and made you close your eyes and just shoved it into your mouth? Would you like that? That's a fair point. All right. Thank you. It's really not a big deal. Okay, okay. Here is the tube. Oh, my God. Now, don't... It's... Oh, my God! It's very small. What's this part? This isn't going in. That won't fit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Relax. It won't fit. This stays on the outside. This is just for me so I can do this. Oh. Oh, my God! It moves! Yeah. I have full control over where we're looking in there. This is a horrible mistake. No, it isn't. No, Kevin. You should never show anybody that. Well, I did warn you about that. Listen, if at any time, you're uncomfortable... Yeah, right now. As in, right now, this time... Let's just... let's keep an open dialogue then, okay? "Pete, be gentle." "Pete, that's too rough." "Pete, you've gone too deep." Hopefully, "Pete, you went in, you went out, and I didn't even feel it." Let's just keep talking. Pete and Kevin are in this together, okay? And if Pete's not around, Jenny's here. Say, "Jenny, this feels really great." Well, Pete... Oh, God. Let's just do it. Okay, let's just let Pete take care of everything. Oh! Hey, Gumma, I got your message. What's going on? Oh, I came to see Duke, and I couldn't find him. I... He wasn't in his room. He wasn't anywhere. It's, like... All right, listen, I'm here. I don't want you to worry about anything; I'm gonna go find our Gumpa, okay? Oh, thank you, honey. Gumpa Duke? Hello? (man and woman moaning) Oh, God, this is fantastic. WOMAN: Oh, Duke, oh. Oh, Duke, yes! (moans) (moaning) Oh, Duke! Oh, you wonderful, wonderful... (groans) Gumpa! Gumpa, no, no! Gumpa, get that... get that out of there. Gumpa! (gasps) Who are you? Gumpa, this is not your wife! It's not my wife? No, this is not your wife! This is not my room? No, no, but your real wife is in this building right now, so we're gonna have... Oh, my God. Condoms, really? What do you think, you're gonna get her pregnant? You can never be too safe. Okay, enough, enough. You need to put this on. We need to get out of here. This is full-on adultery. This is not Alzheimer's. So he is treating this old-age home like a dorm. Oh, yeah, he's loving it. He's just, like, cruising the halls looking for horny old widows. He's got the condoms. It's like Spring Break 1936 for him. I got to say, I know he's your grandpa and he's cheating on your grandma, but I respect him even more now. Gumpa's a goddamn genius is what he is. I'm gonna start doing that. I just can't ever remember what the disease is called. Alzheimer's. No, that's not it. Well, well, well, if it isn't the trade rapist. Uh, I'm sorry, what? Are you kidding me? You trade-raped me in the doctor's office. I was drugged to the gills, and you took advantage of me and my running backs. I did not trade-rape you. I traded with you. No, it wasn't consensual. In what world would I possibly give you Trent Richardson and Reggie Bush for Pierre Garcon? Okay, let me refresh your memory on how it went down... I wanted to thank you for taking time out of your day to come and pick me up. It means a lot. Hey, anything for friends. Yes, for friends. Best friends. Best friends. RUXIN/PETE: Bullshit! Thank you. For as it is written in Matthew, "truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me." Today in the shadow of Min-Ji Webster's untimely passing, let us all reflect upon the darker recesses of our own souls and remember how much we depend on each other to bring light into our lives. May we honor Min-Ji's memory by being beacons of hope to the despairing and discouraged among us. I now call on Roxy Leblanc to come forward and say a few words. I didn't know Min-Ji very well. None of us really did. But what I've learned about her since is that she had a really big heart. She came here from another country because she fell in love with a soldier. She became an FRG leader to honor him and to play her part as an army wife. She was even studying to become an American citizen. She put her heart into all of this. And... when things came crashing down... I believe her heart just broke. I'm so sorry, Min-Ji. We didn't know. We should have. But we didn't. I guess the best way at we can honor her now... Is to be there for each other whenever we fall. Good-bye. "Toad eagerly scrambled into the seat vacated by the driver, took the steering wheel in his hands, listened with affected humility to the instructions given him, and set the car in motion." Oh. Hold on for a sec, baby girl. Hello. Hey, Roland. Got a minute? Charlie, what's up? Nicole's fine. In fact, she's coming home tonight. That's great. I know. I talked to her, and the army's flying in the walking wounded so they can return with the brigade. I'm so happy for you. Thank you. So what's wrong? I'm just wondering if I should be there when she gets off the bus. Right. You've never done that before. I-I- - We've never done anything like that before. Nicole hasn't wanted it. Not where the army's concerned. Do you want to go? More than anything in the world. Well, I think you've got your answer. Mm. This won't be like the usual homecoming. Normally, we have a big blowout with music and food and banners and all that stuff. But we couldn't do that on such short notice. Hey, as long as they're coming home, I'm happy. Thanks for giving me a ride to the pick-up spot. No problem. - Actually, it's assembly point, not... - "Pick-up spot." Whatever. Makes Hector go wild. Really? Can I smell it? Do you mind? Go for it. Whoo! Whoo! Frank. Hey, baby. Mm. Mm. Mwah. Welcome home. Oh, thank you. It's good to be home. Ohh. Hey, gorgeous. Ohh. You're all right? I'm great. Hector! Hector! Hector! Gloria! Over here! Hector. Mm. Don't you ever leave me like that again. You hear me? Okay. Come here. - There he is. - Dad! Ohh. Hey, guys. Hey, baby. Mwah. Ohh. I know it's only been a week, but it feels like forever. You smell good. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Tanya. Hey. Hey. Oh, welcome home. Thank you. Would you care to join us for a home-cooked meal? - Oh, thanks. I'm exhausted. - Aw. Well, hell, so am I. But you gotta eat something, right? Rain check? - All right. - Of course. Kevin. Hey. Hey. I'm so glad you're home. Everything okay? Everything's great. Good. Let's go welcome home the wounded. Welcome home, Captain. Thank you, Sir. Good to see you again, Captain. We couldn't have done it without you. Thank you, Sir. This is my wife Jackie. Nice to meet you. Same, ma'am. Sorry we wrapped things up before we could get you back there, Captain. I'll get over it, Sir. This is my wife Denise. Welcome home. Glad to have you back, Captain. Thank you, ma'am. It's good to be back. Don't be mad. Come here. Congratulations on the job well done. Thank you, Michael. Now go get some well-deserved rest. Oh, Roger that, Sir. A successful mission. Yes, Sir. Something on your mind, Joan? I was just thinking, Sir. We sent a combat brigade halfway around the world on a dangerous mission, and the only fatality we suffered was an army wife here at home. Yeah. Since the beginning of the 20th century the balance of power had been shifting. The conflict of interest among the big nations had escalated and the factionalism had already started. Ottoman Empire, fighting in the Balkan War in such a setting, was severely defeated. Without a single shot being fired Thessaloniki was relinquished to Greece and Kirklareli to Bulgaria. Both Rumelia and the Aegean Islands were out of the Empire's power. That meant losing thirty per cent of the soil and twenty present of the population. The community was distraughtly immigrating from Rumelia to their homeland. 1913 Balkan Migration Adapted from "Awakening Canakkale 1915" 1913 Balkan War Veterans August 1914, Anatolia The Mukhtar has been telling us that there would be a world war but I never believed him. Today is the day, then. No one ever talks about anything else. So, we have to pay our debt of gratitude to our motherland, don't we? The debt is on us. This land is not your debt, but your heirloom. Don't you worry about those kinds of things, okay? So what, can't I fire a rifle? Of course you can, who says you can't? But they don't enlist anyone under 20 years of age. Besides, who'll take care of Mom and our younger sibling if you join the army, too? "Mobilization of the army" God speed, son! Don't worry, okay? I'll write you. And you put your prayers out for me. It's all for our motherland's sake, Memed. Come on. Course of becoming a sergeant The most powerful, effective and useful weapon is human! However, it has got to be someone who was brought up as a patriotic wise and a faithful soldier. You have to work hard to become so. You'll train your troops accordingly. We'll restore our honor which was damaged during the Balkan War. Never forget, never let anyone forget: No enemy, no army, no weapon is stronger than patriotism. November 1914, Allied Forces Armada High seas of the Aegean Sea We've received information that the British Navy is cruising off the shore of the Aegean Sea. Increase precautions. Yet, we're running low on ammunition. Canakkale, Cimenlik Fort Cevat Pasha Command Room There are only 22 long-range artilleries and 50 armour-piercing shells per artillery. Ask for armour-piercing shells from Istanbul. Tell them to rip the artillery off older ships and send them here. Yes, sir! You sent for me, Sir? Nazmi Bey, the situation at the strait is critical. We have to put the strait under protection. Increase the number of minefields to 7. War is closing in. November 3,1914 Seddulbahir Sir, there are 4 big battleships following one another's wake in the front. They are preparing to fire. Inform the Station Command Post. The enemy ships halted 15 kilometers to the shore of Seddulbahir. They are ready to fire, Sir. This is an official declaration of war. Have you reached the Ertugrul Bastion, yet? We're working on it, Sir. Send a messenger right away and ask for casualty report. Yes, sir! We know that their goal is to disable the bastions at the gate and enter the strait. Increase the number of mine lines to 10. Yes, sir! Sir? Yes, Adil Bey? We are running low on ammunition. The ammunition from Germany hasn't reached us yet. Yes. Bulgaria is blocking the ammunition transfer. - We should eke out everything. - I couldn't agree with you more, Sir. We have alerted the other bastions. Get a line on the situation at once. Yes, Sir! Kilitbahir Mecidiye Bastion To your positions! Everyone, to your positions! Get in line! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! My sons! Our enemy is at the door. They set their eyes upon our land. They are here to make an attempt on our mothers' sisters', brothers' lives. Our resources are limited. And our enemy is strong. But they are here to take what's ours. They are here to take our land. They are here to kill but we're here to die. Now... If there's anyone who doubts himself, speak now. Should I die, step on me and carry on. Should I get injured, don't you worry! There are others to replace the martyr and the injured. Fulfill this sacred mission bestowed by God! Do not let the enemy through this strait! We won't! We will not stop fighting till the last man stands, till we all die! We won't! They have placed the 57th Infantry Regiment under my command. I'm leaving for Tekirdag. I'll look at it when I hone for them. Take my photo first with the kids, and then four of us together. Okay Ahmet Efendi? When you come back, one more photo is on me. Come, come, come here. Come here, son! - When you're ready! - We are ready Ahmet Efendi. February 1,1915 Tekirdag, 19th Division Command I find your regiment very impressive, Huseyin Avni Bey. Thank you, Sir. There are soldiers from various regions; like an all-Turkish mix. The regiment is made up of the finest of the 3rd Regiment. That's why the 57th Infantry Regiment is like a flower bouquet. However, one cannot say the same for the other two regiments. Isn't that correct, Izzettin Bey? You are right, Sir. These regiments come from Syria. The commanders have just been appointed. It is better to give them some time. I, of course, will give them some time. Let's see if the enemy is willing to give us any? We have to be prepared for the worst in a very short time. I want you to see about the trainings of both regiments. Yes, Sir. Nevertheless, there is one more important issue. The rifles in the division are all old Martin Rifles. They give problems with the trigger mechanism after few shots. So, our rifles become sticks. That's bad. We have to renew the rifles. Contact Corps Commander Fahrettin Bey. Follow through on. Look at these clothes; they are all spick-and-span, aren't they Boyabatli? Yes, they are Osman. I haven't seen anything as new as this one since my mother gave me my father's wedding suit to wear for my Uncle Memet's wedding ceremony. They won't last, you know that, right? They say that training will get tougher. It's okay if they don't last. Yes, you're right. It's okay if they don't last. It will either be the soil of our homeland or the blood of the enemy that stains them. Why do they call you Boyabatli? Don't you have a name? Sure, I do. Boyabatli Omeroglu Mustafa. And I'm Veli the shepherd. And this is Mehmet Ali. He was supposed to be the only teacher in our village. Yes. Just you wait till the war is over. Then I will finish school and be a teacher, God willing! Why not? Why not? God is all mighty! HMS Queen Elizabeth Allied Forces Command Room Seddulbahir Sergeant Bengali Mehmet and his Platoon Brothers, let's cut to the chase. This soil we're standing on is an heirloom from our fathers. Our motherland is our mothers' honor. The enemy intends to tarnish their honor! - Do you understand? - Yes, sir! Do not over estimate the British from hear say babblings. They are human like us. A round, a bayonet is enough to finish them off. Shall we fight till we die for our motherland? - With Allah's help! - Shall we fight? With Allah's help! Shall we make them regret the day they were born as soon as they land? - With Allah's help! - Shall we? With Allah's help! They're coming, Sir! Now, take up your positions quietly. No bullets will be fired unless I command so! In the name of Allah! Come on, in the name of Allah! Fire! Come on lads! Do not let anyone pass! Damn! Damn! This soil, this land is mine! Fix bayonets! Charge! Allah Allah! The British division which went up Seddulbahir for reconnaissance is stopped by Bigali Mehmet Pasha's platoon, Sir. That's good, but we can't stop the bombardment. Canakkale, Cimenlik Fort Cevat Pasha Command Room The bastions are under protection, but the cities are almost destroyed. They know the range of the artillery at the entrance bastions, Sir. They are deploying 17 thousand meters off the coast. Our weapons with the longest range are insufficient at this point. The bullets we fire don't seem to reach the ships. Mine Warfare Commander, Captain Nazmi Bey is here, Sir. Send him in. You sent for me, Sir? Come in Nazmi Bey. Have a seat. How many mines are there in your warehouse? - There are 26 of them right now. - Which minelayer's turn is it? It's Muskrat's turn. Good. The enemy navy sets sail from the same region, towards the same route to be able to maneuver in the strait. From here. From the Karanlik Liman. We should deploy the mines here. Yes, Sir. I believe that if we start laying our 26 mines on this route it will be impossible for the reconnaissance vessels to notice us. Plus, the shore is really high here. The sun doesn't reflect on the sea until noon. Have Nusrat prepared. This mission has to be accomplished tonight. Yes, Sir. You know that the enemy vessels constantly check the strait with lights. Be very cautious. If they notice you're there, they'll try to sink you. Try to make it back safe and sound. If we can't make it back, may our homeland live long! March 8,1915 Our batteries on the hills will not be using searchlights tonight. We have to reach the end of the Karanlik Liman like ghosts. - God speed! - Yes, sir! There shouldn't be any sparks from the chimneys. No smoke! Put off the fires! Don't let the engines make a lot of noise! - Turn off the lights! - Yes, sir! Let's go Captain Hakki! It's time to go. - Slow ahead! - Slow ahead! - First mine ready! - First mine ready! - Let go the mine! - Let go the mine! - Let go the mine! - Let go the mine! Akbas Port I haven't slept a wink because of this rifle issue. At ease soldier. When can you deliver the ammunition chests? - In the small hours, sir. - You've been of great help, kiddo. - Thank you. - Thank you, Sir. These are Mauser Rifles. Our lads can shoot a fly on the eye with these. Check the artillery, see if the wagonetts are in place and get the ammunition ready. - Yes, sir! March 18,1915 Canakkale Sea Battle Captain, they're about to enter the strait! First the destroyers, than the torpedo boats. They're inspecting the strait. There are four British battleships in the front. One of them is the HMS Queen Elizabeth, and four French battleships in the second row. - Roger that. Let me know if there is more. 18 battleships, 600 artillery. God help you! Set it, set it, and hurry up! Feed a round! More! Feed it! Fire! - Ready? - Ready, sir! Wait! Hang on! Hang on! Now! Fire! Don't waste the artillery! They are out of our range! Everyone, to the shelters! To the shelters, hurry! - Casualty report? - Two of the gun cars are broken, Sir. We have to find a way to carry the shells to the artillery. Each shell weighs 275 kilos. It's impossible to carry them without gun cars. What shall we do, Lieutenant? Shall we wait to die, our hands tied? Duck lads, duck! We have to get out of here. Sir, they have entered our range. Thank you Allah! To the artilleries! To the artilleries! Come on lads! To your artillery! Feed it! Fire! Fire! Can we fix this? It'd take a long time even if we tried. Besides, we don't have enough material, Sir. Ships are in our range, Sir. It's in our range. Allah, help me! Ammunition guards. What is it Seyit? Lay it on my back! How can you carry it yourself Seyit? It weighs 275 kilos. So, let them defeat us? The commander is bursting into tears with anger by the artillery! I said lay it on me! Allah! Leave it! Easy, easy, easy. Careful. Put it down, Seyit. - Pull it up, up, up, up! - Bring it here, bring it! - Is it ready? - Yes, Sir! Fire! We need one more shell. One more! Come on! Let's go! Hurry! Go, go, go! Come on lads, come on boys! We need another shell! Come on boy! Come on lad! Take the sled. Easy, easy! Careful! Easy, easy. - Come on, help him! Take this shell! - Come on Seyit! Pull it up, up, up, up, up! Pull it up! Up, up, up! Bring it! Ready it! - Okay? - Ready, sir. Fire! - Once more! - Give it to me! Give it! Let go! Take the shell! Take the shell and pull it up! Pull it up! - Set it! - Ready, Sir! Fire! Sir, Bouve is trying to retreat to the Karanlik Liman. Canakkale Bastion Dardanos Bastion Erenkoy Bastion Kilitbahir Bastion Intepe Bastion Captain, they're retreating! March 18,1915 Istanbul / Suleymaniye Mosque Canakkale Impassible Report. There are 9 severely damaged artilleries at the bastion. One third of the armour-piercing rounds are used. Two thirds are available. Good. How about the casualty of the enemy? It's estimated to be around 800's. 3 of the battleships have been sunk. 5 battleships are non-combatant. 1 destroyer, 3 torpedo boats and a couple of minesweepers have sunk. With this few casualties we managed to defeat the so-called invincible navy and the colonists daunting us for years. We managed to startle them. One week later Sir, the papers say that General Hamilton has been appointed... Their intendment is obvious. They'll try to take the Canakkale Strait from land. I can understand why they don't give up. For them, this war is not just about taking the straits. They're taking it as a matter of pride. 83 thousand soldiers and officers are put under his orders. It's said that troops from Australia, India and New Zealand are encamping in Egypt. So, what kinds of precautions have you taken so far? We've deployed two divisions of troops to crucial points in Gallipoli. Two thirds of them are at the shore and one third of them are in shelters ready to respond upon request of help. Post machine guns to those crucial points. And the artillery behind them. Make sure the peaks and the shelters and their connections are ready. Yes, Sir. Okay lads, come on. How many times have I told you to use the wire carefully? If I have to yell at you to make you do that, then that's what I'll do. May Allah give me strength! Should I tell you off? What did you do? Look, don't carry the sandbags here, the bushes will do just fine. - Use these forthe peaks, got it? - Yes, Sergeant! Let's go lads! What did you do? Put those piles on them. Don't forget to leave room for the rifles. Son, can anyone fit here? Loosen it up a bit. Let me see! Throw it away. Good job, well-done. Take these away, clear this place. Send them. Throw them, throw them, they are huge! Ariburnu Lieutenant Muharrem Our artillerymen defeated the so-called invincible fleet. However, the enemy is sure to come back. With more weapons, more shells and more men. Our brothers in arms, our friends will martyrize right in front of our eyes. - They'll bury us alive. - In our own land! Shall we keep fighting with all we've got, even if our peaks collapse even if our weapons brake, even if we run out of rounds, we go hungry? Yes! - Shall we fight? - Yes! - Shall we prevail? - Yes! They say the enemy has an invincible navy to protect them. Who cares? We have our mothers' prayers to protect us! We're reviving. Bozcaada Offshores Allied Forces Armada According to the information received this morning, The Ministry of War is putting together an army exclusively for here. General Liman Von Sanders is appointed to command this army. I was at service with him. It's nearly impossible for junior officers to speak in front of the General. It's possible that he'll make communication impossible in the army. The largest troop he commanded in Germany was nothing but a cavalry division. He has never fought in any wars before. It's not acceptable to let him command an army who'll fight to death. - What was his rank there? - He was a brigadier general. He's the Marshall here. Why not a Turkish Commander? Enver Pasha is the only one to answer that. What if he doesn't approve our plan and our battle order? He's one of the most important men in the German Empire. I'm sure he won't make such a mistake. This plan is the most suitable and the most effective plan considering the geographic features of the region and our army. We can accomplish a result in a day with this plan. Let's not be pessimistic about it. Not to worry. If he's smart, he won't change the plan. March 31,1915, Ariburnu Liman von Sander's Inspection Ariburnu is filled with deep cliffs, Sir. It's impossible to take control of the place. The 27th Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Sefik Bey's command is deployed to crucial points in Ariburnu. This area you see is reinforced with heavy weaponry and batteries. The crucial points are prepared this way, Sir. We'll repel the enemy as soon as they land on the ground. No, no, that's impossible. Soldiers cannot manage that. Loses would be great. We need a new plan. This plan is faulty. We'll retreat to our emplacements and will defend with our own troops. All forces, main troops, machine guns and artillery will be deployed even backwards as of today. We've received strict orders. Small troops, not more than a battalion of soldiers will stay at the crucial points. Commander's new plan spiked our guns, sir. The Commander's plan has ruined everything, Sir. If the enemy lands on ground, they'll stay there. They'll multiply in numbers and get stronger day by day. He wouldn't listen to any objections. Is that so? So we'll fight changing Liman Pasha's understanding whilst fighting our enemy. Bigali Village Lt. Col. M. Kemal's Command Centre Liman Pasha had our battalion relocated in Biga as army reserve. We report directly to him. We're no longer at the crucial point. The only battalion at the crucial points will be of Halil Sami Bey's. How can one battalion defend the region between Ariburnu and Seddulbahir? There are at least ten places convenient for naval landing. But we're forming an army. New troops will arrive soon. He'll deploy them to Saroz and Canakkale side. He believes the greatest danger posed is there, not the Canakkale Peninsula. The 27th Regiment located between Kabatepe and Ariburnu has just one battalion over there. Who knows how many new soldiers will arrive? Is one battalion enough to defend this ground position? We managed to put together a sufficient force with Halil Sami Bey's division. Regiments, artilleries, machine guns were supposed to protect the terrain that is accessible for naval landing. The Commander dispersed us. He brought our division here. How can one battalion defend Ariburnu, Kocadag or Conkbayiri? Seddulbahir Major M. Sabri's Command Centre There's locomotion both on sea and in the air. It's apparent that the landing is close. We have to fight back before the reinforcement arrives. We stay back till the naval gunfire is over. As soon as the bombardment is over we'll take our emplacements and fight. Believe in Allah, yourselves and yoursoldiers. Good luck lads. Thank you sir! One day before landing Captain Faik and his 270 men squadron April 24,1915 Ariburnu Allah all mighty; keep our families, our children, our country safe from the enemy. - Amen! Help our army succeed. Amen. - Dear Allah, grant us all patriotic deaths! - Amen! Veli? If I become a martyr take this dog tag to my Mum and give herthe bad news yourself. Tell her that... Mehmet Ali, don't say it. You'll go back to your Mother and I'll go back to my Dilber in the end. We'll go back to them. Tell her not to cry in vain. Say, "Your son was proud to be martyr. You should be proud to be the mother of a martyr." Tell her to use my martyr pension to send Hasan to school and help him become a teacher. All right. All right. Now go to sleep. We'll stand sentry later on. You're right. See the beauty of the sea, Muharrem? How can we let the enemy have this paradise on earth? Not to worry, sir. Our soldiers will fight to the last drop of their blood. - They won't let anyone touch this land. - I wish things were different. But that shall pass. We'll work hard and this land will be as powerful as it was in its old days. We'll build roads, schools, hospitals, factories and be saved from all this poverty and ignorance. There's much to be done to shake off that inferiority complex towards the West. Allah willing, and with our patriotism we can do anything we want, Sir. - Rest assured. - Lf Allah lets, Muharrem. I hope Allah grants us our wishes. Amen. Captain Faik! Captain Faik! There are some ships ahead. They can't be that low in numbers. There must be more behind. It's obvious that they're waiting for the nightfall to attack. - Muharrem. - Yes, Sir. Notify all three teams. Everyone should take up their positions. I'll go and notify battalion commanders so that they can alert the other divisions. - Yes, sir! - Let's go. Come on, lad! April 25,1915 04:30 AM, Ariburnu Come on, hurry up! Reduce the view range. Stay low. Lower. Become invisible. Down. That's it. Listen, no one will fire unless the commander orders so, is that clear? - Yes, Sergeant. - Lf anyone shoots a bullet in vain I'll kick them right in front of the enemy. Come on now! Yes, Sergeant. You'll shoot the officers first. Don't forget; first the officers. Why don't you stay low? Do you want to get shot? Come on lads! Let's go boys! Open your eyes now! - Snuff all the torches off. - Yes, sir. Come lads! You go boys! Come on! - Sergeant Ahmet! - Yes, sir! - Get ready. They're coming. - Yes, Sir. Be cautious. Allah! Fire! Medic! Osman! April 25,1915 04:45 AM 27th Regiment Command Lt. Col. Sefik's Tent Put me through the Chief of Staff. Yes, sir! I'm listening, Colonel Sefik. Sir, the enemy has started naval landing at Ariburnu. My regiment is ready to respond. If we leave now, we'll be there in three hours. It's not the only place where they're landing. We're trying to determine how and where to use the few forces we have. Don't take action unless you're ordered to. I've spoken to the battalion commander. The enemy is spreading in waves. We're running late, Sir. Wait for orders to take action, Sefik Bey. It's easiersaid than done. How can I wait? How am I supposed to wait when my boys are burning in flames down there? We hear artillery fires from Seddulbahir, Sir. Our regiment is caught between two fires. - Get ready. Prepare to take action. - Yes, sir. April 25,1915 04:45 AM, Seddulbahir Stay in your positions! We'll wait here until the bombardment is over. Bombardment is over. Everyone to their positions! To the front trenches, hurry! Put them right. Make room for your weapons and take up your positions! Take up your positions! Wait until the barges are closer. We'll fire at the same time upon order and won't let anyone land on oursoil. Come on boys! Bismillah! Fire! April 25,1915 05:45 AM 27th Regiment Command Lt. Col. Sefik's Command Tent Yes, Sir? You can set off for Ariburnu, Sefik Bey. Yes, Sir. Thank you. Lieutenant! Prepare your troops! We're leaving for Ariburnu. - Yes, Sir. - Hurry! We've left our trenches, but this is the final point. - We can't retreat any further than this. - Yes, Sir. - Aren't there any medics? - No. They're all gone. Hang on brother. Hang on. Where is the Captain? They were behind us. They haven't arrived yet, Sir. The enemy keeps coming, Sir. Give me bullet! Give me your rifle! Bigali Village Lt. Col. M. Kemal's Command Centre There must be a reason why they landed at Ariburnu. Their real target must be Conkbayiri and Kocacinartepe. If they capture those places, the war will be over before it even begins. There is no news from the army corps. Liman Pasha went to Bolayir to inspect the situation in Saroz. Can you believe this? The Army Commander is not where he's supposed to be. He's inspecting! Sir! Sir, Captain is shot! We'll all shuffle off our mortal coils before the regiment comes to our rescue. Sergeant, be cautious. Sir! Sir! Veli! Veli, help me! Get my commander to the hospital now! Veli! Allah please help me! Protect me and my brothers in arms, and my commanders. Grant me the chance to get my revenge for today. You infidels! You infidels! How could you shoot our commander? Listen to me lads! This is the final point! There's no turning back. - We'll all become martyrs here, understood? - Yes, Sergeant! Come on lads! Hang on, Sir. Stay with me. Hang on, Sir. We're here, Sir. Sir, we're here. Are you wounded, brother? No, it's not me. I brought our injured commander. He is shot in the chest. May Allah have His blessings on him and let you help him survive. - I'll be with my brothers in arms. - Hang on! You should rest a while. How can I? Later. Sergeant, Sergeant, I brought the commander there. Sergeant, my rifle, Sir. I brought our commander here. Sergeant? Ali? Where are you? - Here! - Sergeant is dead. It's really bad. I don't know for sure how many of us are left. Based on the gun report, I'm guessing not many. Sergeant told us that this is our final point and that we shouldn't retreat any further than this. Let's take him. My rifle! Come on lads! Move! Hasn't Liman Pasha given any information, any instructions, Kazim Bey? No, Sir. He went to Bolayir to watch the Saroz Bay, with one of his aide-de-camps. But how, Kazim Bey? You are the Chief of Staff of this army. How can he leave without informing you? When will he be back then? We don't know that either, Sir. He left without saying a word. Is there a naval landing in Saroz? We'd know by now if there was. We've got two divisions there. All right, Kazim Bey. Pasha, what shall we do? I'm leaving for Bolayir to get permission from the commander. You start preparing to relocate our headquarters to the closest point to the war as possible. - Yes, Sir. May Allah be with you. April 25,1915 07:40 AM I'm out of rounds, Ali. - 1st Battalion should prepare to attack. - Yes, Sir. Come on! The regiment is here. Thank Allah! Thank Allah! 27th Regiment Take up your positions! Machine gunners, faster! Move! A few hours later - Those infidels keep coming! - Our commander is hit. We sent him back. We're decreasing in numbers. They keep bringing up reinforcements. There are no other officers left in our division. You should be careful. If something bad happens to me, you know the orders! There's no turning back! Halil Sami Bey left an urgent telephone message. His division must be in a very difficult situation. He's asking you to send a division to Ariburnu to help them. We can't stop the enemy with help from a single division. Izzettin Bey, we're going to Kocacimentepe and Conkbayiri. We'll attack them if necessary, and make sure that they cannot take that region. Sir, we're nothing but an army reserve. If we go to war without orders from the army commander... I'll do what I believe is necessary to protect our land. They can punish me later if they want to. Should they capture that area, they'll have the control of the strait and can reach Istanbul. Then everything is over. Prepare the 57th Infantry Regiment for departure. - I want one battery to accompany us. - Yes, sir. Ariburnu Lt. Col. Sefik's Command Centre We're decreasing in number Sir, we're melting like snow. There's nothing on the right flank. We don't have the power or the troops to go there. The enemy is going up, to Conkbayiri. There are no forces to meet them up there. We can't do anything, but wait. Thank you. This is the moment of truth. It's certain that there are thousands of enemy soldiers behind this advanced platoon, anxious to capture this region. We'll drive them to Ariburnu and then to the sea. We'll clear off all those hills. To achieve this, we have to beat an enemy who is much more powerful than we are. I do not order you to fight I order you to die! We'll all die, if we have to! We'll gain time for the army. In the time which passes until we die, other troops and commanders can come forward and take our places. May Allah be with you! Thank you! 10 AM, Ariburnu 57th Regiment Sir? Ariburnu Lt. Col. Sefik's Command Centre - At ease. - 57th Infantry Regiment made it on time. They've come here, sweeping the region off the enemy under Mustafa Kemal Bey's order. They are deploying from the creek behind us. Soldier, tell Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kemal Bey that I and my regiment are at his service. - Yes, sir! Thank Allah. Call the headquarters right now! See if the other two regiments are on their way. Yes, sir! The 19th Division under Lt. Col Mustafa Kemal's command managed to drive the Anzacs to the sea. The Anzac troops were trapped in a piece of land on the coast. The 57th Regiment suffered heavy casualties. Yes. The skirmishes were very intense. We gained 36 hours for the army. However, reinforcements haven't arrived yet. I'll retreat back to the second defence line and try to protect the survivors. Yes, Sir. The British are exhausted, too. I don't think they'll try to chase us. However, it's possible that the naval forces can inflict damage. We'll take action at the earliest opportunity. Yes, sir! As you wish, sir! Yes, sir! Sergeant, we'll retreat back to the second defence line. Yes, sir! What's your decision upon the critically wounded? We'll see about that, child. We'll see about that, too. I can stay with the wounded, Sir. Make them feel comfortable till their dying breath. If you'd like to say goodbyes... What can I say? What shall I say? How can I look in their eyes and comfort them? Fighting is much easier than that. 70 lives. 70 sons. We left them to the mercy of Allah, to the pity of the enemy. Istanbul Red Crescent Centre Yes ladies, what is that you wish to say? News from Canakkale are not good, Pasha. Lots of martyr and injured. They even started transporting casualties to Istanbul. That's correct. Casualties are transported in crowds. But, why are you asking? How can we sit here, doing nothing when our men are fighting for our homeland, Pasha? We ask of you to start caretaking and nursing courses for us to attend. It's impossible not to be delighted by your offer. However, you should know that some won't like this idea. They are oursons, Pasha. Our brothers, fathers. If helping them is a sin, I'm ready to pay for this sin, Pasha. - I'm ready to pay, too, Pasha. - Me, too. We're ready to pay for oursins as long as our land is safe. Ladies, thank you all. I'll start courses immediately. However, remember that nursing is a difficult task. It's like serving in the army as soldiers. We'll serve our army as soldiers if that's necessary. Anatolia Recruiting Office I'd like to see the commander, son. - Let me help you, Mam. - No, son. Just take me to the commander. Wait here. Let me see. We've heard that our army has won great victories. That it has been resisting the enemy. May Allah bless you all! My husband went to the Russo War, and my son to South Arabia. I'd been knitting socks for them to wear when they get back. They didn't. You, commander! All I have is a beating heart, a hut and these that I dote on. Now I've brought these to you. Send them to our veterans. As long as their feet are warm, Allah will rest my martyrs' souls. Bon appetite. Leave me alone, you rascals! Hey! Hey, move! Hey, we're hungry, too! We're children of the same land, I don't get it! Did the enemy send you? Why don't you stay overnight? Can you get any closer? Seddulbahir Behind the front - Sir? - At ease. There's a critical situation. The troops carrying us food have been shot by enemy artillery. We won't be able to serve our soldiers any food. They haven't eaten proper meals for days. We have to find a solution. Our soldiers are barely surviving upon the dried nuts provided. I see. Captured Anzac Entrenchment - Take these. - Take it, take it. What's this? - Boyabatli? - What Veli? - What's this? - What? Mirrors. - Mirrors? - Yup. You cunning rascals! That's how they shot our soldiers, then. - See? - Yup. It's easy for them to protect themselves when these are in the trenches. We only use mirrors to shave but those rakes use them to save themselves. Ahmet, come over here! Look what we've found! - I'm coming, Sergeant. - Hurry, come! You know about that stuff. I can replicate them, Sergeant. If we can find material... If you can replicate, we'll get you the material. Really? Let's use mirrors so that we can fight with even chances. Come on then, come on. May 11,1915 Seddulbahir Offshore, Goliath Battleship We have to sink this gigantic battleship. Sir, torpedo boats and destroyers cruise around it to protect this ill-fated ship. It's almost impossible. Almost? So, it's not totally impossible. What's your suggestion, Captain? If Captain Nazmi can help us get before. You can get her back now. I want a family. I want to live the dream, yeah! Live, damn it! Come on, buddy, live! It's a good omen. So do you go back to med camp this summer? Yeah, I've been invited back. Although I think sports medicine was a bit of a lark. I might go in a different direction. Like? Cardiology? I know heart disease is a big issue for women, so I'll probably focus on women and heart problems. What's the best school for that? I don't know, but that's another reason to go to this camp. You make great connections, and they give great career guidance selecting a school, and they help you get into the school. It's a really great thing for me. I so admire you for knowing exactly what you want to do. I'm still not sure. Although if I stay in the meat business, I'm sure it'll be out of the butcher shop and more in an office. My dad never went to college, and he's done well for himself, but he'd like me to go, and I want to go. I'll probably get a degree in international business. Is that why you're learning Italian? That and other reasons. We have family in Italy. My dad's Italian and Jewish, actually, My dad's dad is from Brooklyn. He was Jewish. And then my dad's mom was Sicilian. Catholic? Yep. And your mom? From Brooklyn, but both sides Italian-- and Catholic, yeah. I'm WASP, all the way. So how is your dad? That is a crazy match, my dad and Betty, but they seem happy. You can never tell you will fall in love with whom. No, you can't. * I want to get married. Oh, me, too. When? Whenever you want. I want a wedding. A small wedding here. Oh, I don't know. I don't think your friends and family will ever be as excited as me about getting married. I don't have any family here other than Ben, and he loves you. And if my friends don't love you, they're not my friends. It's as simple as that. So you go get yourself a beautiful wedding dress and tell me what you want in terms of flowers and things like that, who you want in the wedding, and we'll do it. Ecru. I beg your pardon? Well, I don't think I should wear white. I think I should wear ecru. You can wear any color you want. You can wear red if you want. Okay. Well, maybe not red. Ecru, then. Mmm! What exactly is ecru? Oh, it's like a dirty white. Thanks for dropping by. It was nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. So how's that parked car sounding now? Perfect. This was a bad idea. I'll say. So what did you think? He's cute. Do you like him better than Ben? No. Me, either. I thought he was cute. I'm joking. I was just trying to stay in the conversation. I think the Ben and Amy thing is over. You don't know that. You don't know that. I know that. No, you don't. Yes, I do. Ben is out with Grace tonight. He asked her out, and she wanted to go out with him. She told me this? Yeah, she told me. And why are you just telling me? Yeah, why are you just telling her? This is the strangest date I think I've ever been on. Excuse me? I think we should call Amy. No. No, no, no. You know they're going to tell her. Did you know? Yeah, but I don't care. How do you know? I told him. Why? Because you two were a half hour late. I was running out of stuff to talk about. We're not on a date. You don't have to talk to me. I don't know. I've never been on a double date before. The rules are you're supposed to tell me that has anything to do with Amy. It has nothing to do with Amy. You better watch out. What? What did I do? Jimmy took care of it. He just did that because he thought Ben would do that. Ben would do that. You know, this Jimmy is good. Maybe he's not so bad after all. Yeah. Especially since Ben's out with Grace. I'll do this. No. We'll do this together. I like doing dishes with you. You cooked. I don't mind cleaning, really. Let me finish this. You go check on John. All right. Hey, buddy, what are you doing? I thought you were sleeping. Now you're crying? You weren't making any noise. Come on. Come here. Come on. Hmm? He's fine. Fine. Just checking. Well, if you're checking to se if Adrian's still here, she's still here. Okay. He's fine. We're fine. Just make sure to pay attention to him and not just Adrian. I know. How's your date going? Fine. I'll be there at 6:30 tomorrow morning when he gets up. I'll bring him home when he gets up. As soon as he wakes up, I'll bring him right back to you. All right. Tell Adrian I said hello. I will. Good night. And don't call again, okay? And I don't say that because you're annoying me. I just don't want you to annoy that guy. If you really like him everything's fine. Good night. Good night. They're fine. I knew they would be. So. So, you want to make out? That's not very romantic. Yeah. I do. Great. All right, you start. You kiss me. Come on. it's too awkward if I lean over and kiss you. No. No, you go first. All right. Was that okay? Yeah. If he doesn't come back with her tonight, that's it. I don't think he'll ever drive up there again. I don't think his ego could take it. I don't understand why she won't come home at this point. I know she has to take care of my grandmother, but she has to bring Robbie home. We have to at least try to make it work, or else it's always going to feel like we failed. I don't mind failing if we try first because that's not really failing. Not to try at all is to fail, and-- Oh, my God, am I still talking? Yeah. Sorry. I've-- I've never done that before. I'm not really much of a talker. Maybe you never found the right person to talk to. See, now you've turned it around and made it some kind of gooey "we" thing. You shouldn't have said anything. Now I feel all weird. I know what could make you feel weirder. I could kiss you. Oh, say, get the dog. Moose? Moose! Moose. Darn. I wasn't going to kiss you. Sure you were. What? I never slept with her. You slept with her. You slept with her in Chicago. I did not. And I would tell you if I did. Anne told me. And where is Anne again? With Mimsy. Where with Mimsy this time of night? Give it to me love baby, I need you I'm a person with so many faults I couldn't see that you were hurting I figured it out too late I did Day by day I lived with you in my arms But my heart has grown so weary If I draw one step closer We only get more hurt I cry without a sound I laugh disregarding people around me I swallow the urge to yell Don't go, don't go You're so lovely I loved you so much...

Hwaiting*! (*Korean version of "You can do it!") Oh, it's Sung Min Woo! He's here! What are you talking about? ! How can you demand compensation for damage when it's not even certain? ! Hello? Hello? There was a call saying they wanted to cancel the fan meeting. And Director Kim wanted to postpone our appointment as well. That electronics company you modeled for is demanding compensation for going against the terms of the contract in which you agreed to keep a clean image. What are you going to do? ! Repay them with my money. You're going to repay them and become penniless? All right. Then we can cleanly cut off all ties. You know that you have to leave this house too, right? Leave this house as soon as you can. [Pretty Boy Star Sung Min Woo, Dad of a Six-year-old Child] Although the president of Western Venture Capital is generous, he's known for being no-nonsense. If a scandal like this has erupted, there's no way of knowing if he'll keep going through with this investment because of Sung Min Woo. How could you keep such a huge secret? I'm sorry. I had no idea things would come to this. I have a lot of the blame. But if we're to be exact, the fact that this production has come so far is thanks to Sung Min Woo. That's considering the fact that Sung Min Woo was a top star when we casted him. After getting embroiled in such a huge scandal, things have changed. And on top of that, this investment came in having nothing to do with Sung Min Woo. What do you think President will do? Are you asking because you don't know what his personality is like? I'm getting an idea. You've come? Yeah. The schedule for the venue has been made for today, right? Yes, I'll confirm it. Let me know after you do. President, I'm worried. I heard that the investors have a say on who's cast. Does that mean there's a possibility that Min Woo won't be cast? I have to discuss with the investors to know the answer to your question. If you speak to them clearly, wouldn't they be willing to listen? Since they're putting in their investment because of their trust in you. Is there a reason why I need to do that? You know how hard Min Woo has been working up until now. If you protect him... Yoon Gae Hwa. Do you realize that you're overstepping your boundaries right now? Even though it's you who brought Min Woo here, Yoon Gae Hwa, it's not up to you to interfere in the negotiations about his casting. Please learn to separate your feelings from your work. Yes, Sir. I'm sorry. Yes. This is Sung Min Woo. Could I see you for a moment? What do you want? What's going to happen to me? Sung Min Woo in All That Love... Will you keep him in? All of the projects, CFs, fan meetings, and even dinner meetings. When disturbances like this occur, all of these contracts tend to be canceled. I was just wondering about what was going to happen to The Show's production. I can't give you a definite answer yet. Like you said yourself, since your circumstances have changed, we're going to have to re-examine the entire cast. I'm going to use the crew's and investor's responses to decide. This is the only thing I can tell you as of now. All right, I understand. Thank you for taking your time out to see me. How are you? I wanted to ask what your plan is now. My plan isn't what's most important at the moment. Although your plan isn't what's important, you can still show your sincerity to others. These are the keys to J-Move. There won't be anyone there at night. Keep practicing for now. If you don't even practice, that'll lessen your chances even more. You make this judgment. This call is unable to be answered at this time. [Meddler] [Consecutive Scandals... Sung Min Woo's Recovery of Fame unlikely] Arrange these publicity files and bring them back to me tomorrow morning. All right. Thank you, Team Leader Oh. When you have kids to raise, what are we to do? We need to let this pass. This is the new practice schedule. Contact all of the actors and let them know. All right. Sung Min Woo is not on there. They said that he's already aware. President must have told him. All right. Now, let's put down our bags and wash our hands first! Give it to me, that's right. I'll make some food. Oh! Mom! Did you buy snacks? Huh? Wow, there's so many! Min Woo ahjussi must have stopped by. You need to eat dinner before you have snacks. Wash your hands first. Okay! [Bad Acting] Mom! Ye Eun's clothes got wet! Oh, all right! Excuse me, did Sung Min Woo come home? He didn't come home today. Really? Min Woo! Did you call? Where are you? ! If I draw one step closer It causes us more pain I cry without making a sound I laugh without caring what people think From behind you I swallow the words Don't go, don't go You're so lovely I loved you so much Please have a seat. We've prepared this for you. You might have seen it before but please take a look, you might change your opinion. It's not bad. Yesterday, Yeon Hee... Ye Eun's mom... The package she sent arrived. She sent a letter asking me to stop looking for her. Ye Eun's mom was just one among many I dated at the time. I have no significant memories of her. And although at the moment, I believed I was deeply in love with her, she just became another one of the women from the past that I dated. I had no idea that Ye Eun had come into existence. And the fact that Ye Eun was conceived from that relationship... makes me feel sorry towards her. I feel so sorry towards Ye Eun. That she had to have such lacking parents. You just need to do better from now on. That's probably the reason why Ye Eun has come to you, Min Woo. Do you think I can do well? I'm anxious. A jerk like me, a jerk that lived such a comfortable life... Will I be able to bring Ye Eun up well? All of the stardom, money and fame... I've lost it all. I don't have anything anymore. Can I still be a good dad? I'm not sure. You're going to do well. The Min Woo I've seen all this time is someone who can do well. Don't be worried. Everything will be okay. Be strong! How did you know I was here? Because you like this place. I had a feeling you were going to be here. I guess we really were a married couple at one point. Seeing as though you were able to find me. Where exactly did we go wrong? I'm not sure. What's gotten into you to be bringing that up? I guess people do change. The story of us losing the baby... I didn't want to speak of that again. It was my fault that you took on that job and overexerted yourself. Just the thought that as a man, I couldn't protect my child was unbearable for me to talk about. Still, I'm the one who lost it. I believed it was my fault. I wasn't sure if you were burying yourself in work because you didn't have a child, or it was a relief for you that you didn't have to have a child because you're naturally such a workaholic. I'm not sure which one it is, but anyway... In my heart, I felt like I had issued a debt I couldn't repay. The child... a warm love... It's true that I longed for them. However, I still loved the incredible choreographer in you. Since it's too selfish to say I wanted both things, I moved on from the child issue. But it could be that deep down, I hadn't completely forgotten about our child. If I'm to be honest, I hadn't. You're a little strange today. What's gotten into you to bring up all this? So calmly... having such a long conversation with me. It's like you're a different person. Have you come? It's Choi Hyung Woo. The legendary actor who causes ticket websites to shut down temporarily because of how many people flood them to watch him. What about Choi Hyung Woo? He's the new lead for our production. Take care of his profile and update the cast list. How did you cast Choi Hyung Woo? He's among the most popular of musical actors. He was the secret weapon that the investors had up their sleeve. They said they'd go through with the investment if we cast him. Have him begin rehearsing from today. Yes, Sir, I will. I guess this means Sung Min Woo's out then. It seems like a typical decision of President to make. He has no need for personal relationships or the affection between friends. Because the important things in life are work, success and outcomes. You know that lighting? Is it all set up? Yes, Sir. Could we bring it down a little? Yes, we'll do that. That's not the usual expression you have on your face, Team Leader Yoon. I'm sorry, President. I'm not good at hiding what I'm feeling. You must be disappointed with me because of Min Woo. I think the same way that for the sake of the company that was the only option you had. It's just that... Min Woo was capable of doing well, so I'm a little sad that you couldn't help him portray that. How do you know he's capable of doing well? Min Woo worked extremely hard. His gaze is different now. His gaze is full of determination. If a person develops determination, they can do just about anything. Do you know Min Woo that well? To be able to read his gaze? I believe in Min Woo. You believe in him. Do you really? Of course your decision is the one that carries most weight since you're the president of our company. I'm just saying that's how I think. [Musical All That Love's Casting Changes] What did I tell you? To bow out before your reputation was tainted. This is the drama that we turned down because the conditions weren't right. It's not the lead role but the second male lead. Let's do this for now. Hyung. I'm not going to work with you anymore. What? Do you have the confidence to go on without me? No... I don't. I don't know if I'm going to throw a tantrum again, but I won't have anyone to protect me. No one to give me alcohol and money. Or teach me the best way to act out a role. That's why I don't have the confidence. But... I still want to try alone. Why are you acting like such an amateur? ! Don't you know what this world is like? You might think this is rock-bottom, but things can get worse in a moment's notice! If you can't get back on your feet and are stuck in the same place, are you still going to think you did the right thing? ! That's right. That could be the case. But... If I keep living like this, I feel like I'll be too embarrassed of myself later on. I want to try and live differently. I won't be afraid to try things out on my own. This is Sung Min Woo. Can you spare some time for me? This is the first place we met, right, President? I said that this place is good for a star to have their appointments. At the time, I had no intention of even looking at your script. Just the fact that my teacher of so long ago who always undermined me, was now saying that he needed me because I was a star... All I wanted was to rub it in. But now I have the desire to do it. Not as a star, but as an actor, I'd like to stand on that stage. Do you have the confidence? Even if I do or don't, I still want to do it. Someone once said that doing something just because you have the confidence to do it isn't what's satisfying, but going through and developing the confidence afterwards. And you said this as well. Regardless of if I'm a star or just an average actor, you'd see to the last rehearsal and then make your final decision. Please keep that promise. You're asking this favor of me in such an arrogant way. I guess I haven't lost the star in me yet. Give me a chance. I'll leave without waiting for your answer. Because you're still going to call no matter what your decision is. Min Woo. You're here? I'm sorry, Min Woo. I have nothing else I can say except that I'm sorry. I took Ye Eun because I really wanted to become close with her. But I'll use every word I know to apologize to you. I'm sorry, Min Woo. It's fine. We found her in the end. That's all that matters. I heard you needed to pay a lot in penalty fines and had a lot of casting contracts canceled. What it all boils down to is I made all of this happen. It was going to be discovered sooner or later, and it was something I needed to reveal. It's not because of you so stop blaming yourself. It was my fault for hiding it until now. Since I was lying to you all this time, I'm sorry too. The fashion shoot you were supposed to appear in is to be postponed. I already guessed as much. It seems like you really love Ye Eun. I assumed you'd find kids bothersome and annoying. But it looks like you've changed. How should I put it... like you've become an adult. I'm not sure. But... Min Woo. Can I ask you about just one thing? What's going on between you and Yoon Gae Hwa? Is it sympathy you feel or commiseration for both of you bringing up kids by yourselves? Nothing's going on between you, right? No. No? What are you saying "no" to? I don't think nothing's going on between us. I'm going to rehearse now. Hey, hey this is jackpot! The mom of Sung Min Woo's child has given an exclusive interview! What? ! What's that supposed to mean? Exclusive interview! I had Sung Min Woo's child. The woman who's been hurt twice because of Sung Min Woo's refusal to acknowledge their child! Does she wish to reveal the whole truth? The plot thickens. The story's getting worse and worse! That's ridiculous! Those are all lies! Whether they are or not, the important thing is Sung Min Woo's image. If he's awash in so many scandals, which investor would agree to use that kind of actor? I understand now why Western Venture Capital rescinded their offer. That's not the case though. Who wrote that article? Oh, Yoon Gae Hwa, why didn't you answer the phone... Oh my! What do you think you're doing? ! Are you in your right mind, Yoon Gae Hwa? ! Yes, I'm in my right mind! I'm much more sane than you reporters who write slander and pass it off as an interview with a mom who isn't even here! The Min Woo and Ye Eun's mom that I know aren't such strange, awful people! Why do you make up stories and claim them as other peoples' truths? Is it okay for you to treat other peoples' lives just as you chew gum and throw it away whenever you want? ! Then what about the victims? You write slanderous articles just because you want to garner attention, but what will you do if you cause a small child pain as a result? Who's going to take responsibility for those scars? ! And also, what's so wrong with having a child? Min Woo is a person who's put in a lot of effort to raise that child well. Isn't that enough? ! Why do you have to take that and warp it into him trying to protect his image or having hidden something from the public? He probably hid it because of you making such a riot. How can he reveal it assertively when you clutch at straws and create a huge story from something small? Isn't that so? ! Wow... this ahjumma is quite sensible. You speak well too. W... what are you doing? Why are you taking pictures of me? ! Then who's the child's mom? How do you know of the child's mom? Please tell us! Please give us a statement! Tell us! Ahjumma! Oh! Go quickly! Go! Hurry up! W-w-what? Later! Later! So you used those to spray water on them? How can I not get angry when they're writing such ridiculous slander? Because of that article, you're unable to appear in the musical now. Min Woo, don't despair because you can't do "All That Love" anymore. It's not like that's the only project option you have. I won't despair. Do I seem like someone who'll despair so easily? I guess you don't know Sung Min Woo yet! Right? You're not feeling hopeless? Of course, that's Min Woo for you. Min Woo, take this opportunity to get some much needed rest. Stars need some time to rest to be able to return more awesomely. A crouched frog is able to leap farther. Do you need to compare me to a frog of all things? But weren't the reporters angry? The cameras that reporters carry around are really expensive. What should we do if they write worse articles because they're so angry? Ah, who cares? We'll just use filthy water to spray on them then. If they bring Ye Eun into this or do anything to her, I won't sit still. Oh my, but it'll be hard for you to go back home tonight, Min Woo. Oh well, then you'll have to take responsibility, Ahjumma. What? Ahjussi, you must have been really hungry. You're on your third bowl. Yeah, you see, I haven't been able to eat well lately. Ye Eun, isn't it delicious? Do you want some banchan*? (*side dishes eaten with rice) There, eat up! Ahjussi, you seem like you're a really good dad. Huh? Min Ji, do you want some banchan too? I'm not a baby so you don't need to do that. But could you do something else for me? Oh my, Yu Ra, can you drink slowly, please? You drank all this, you know that? Why do you think this happened? Oh my, I couldn't even tell you. Honestly, you have a prettier face than that woman, a nicer body, a rich family, you studied in New York, and you're even younger than her too. Why is it that woman and not you? I'm not sure either. That woman was married before, got divorced, and even has a kid. Either Min Woo's gone crazy or insane, it's one or the other. Then do they really love each other? Huh? Gone crazy or insane. If that's the case, then it must really be love. I know. Yu Ra... Are you okay? Yeah. But... my heart hurts a little. I went on a picnic today That's what I feel whenever you put your arms around me I forget everything for a moment And feel like I've become a spirit in another world With a bright smile And a clumsy way of talking You're such a special person That's why I like you Because you make me smile My heart that was riddled with scars Is smiling as it looks at you I'm starting to resemble you I keep taking after you I want to become an important person to you Yes, President Yoo? Yes, I will. There are a lot of reporters here. You already know he was all talk. Let's see what he has planned. Let's go. We will now begin the press conference for the innovative musical "All That Love". We'll begin with a word of greeting from President Yoo Si Jun. "All That Love" is a project that I had planned since I started working in this field. It's an honor and a privilege to have finally brought it to life on stage. I hope you'll enjoy it and that it'll be to your liking. Thank you. Now, I'll introduce the actors. The female lead role will be acted by Lee So Young. The supporting lead will be Kim Mi Jung. The male lead role will be Choi Hyung Woo. And also... Sung Min Woo. What? What is this? Sung Min Woo? What kind of shocking reveal is this? The male lead role will be double casted with Choi Hyung Woo and Sung Min Woo. I guess President had this ace up his sleeve. Why are you so touched? Someone might think there's something going on between you and Sung Min Woo. So he wants to use the card that everyone else has thrown in. He's coming off as quite formidable. Formidable? Please. Of course, Yoo Si Jun always feels the need to stand out like that. Oh, how annoying. I wanted to be cooler than you, Hyung. More capable and perfect. When did this ahjumma come and go? [God-called Acting! All That Love's star! Sung Min Woo, hwaiting! ] Does he have a girlfriend? Seeing that he doesn't have a ring on his finger, maybe? Just because he doesn't have a ring on his finger, does that automatically mean he doesn't have a girlfriend? Then should I ask him in a subtle manner? He probably does. I wanted to be cooler than you, Hyung. More capable and perfect. I wanted to be cooler than you. I'm such a lacking person I couldn't see that you were in pain I figured it out too late Too late I lived day to day with you in my arms But my heart is so weary now If I draw one step closer It causes us more pain I cry soundlessly I laugh without caring what people think Standing behind you, I swallowed the words Don't go, don't go I've dreamt this dream... our love I pray this prayer, for the rest of my life I will keep the promise for the rest of my life I dream this dream about our future I dream this dream without being able to stop I will love you till forever You did great! Oh my! Min Woo... Min Woo! Let go! What are you doing? Just... With such an outstanding finale... We've finally succeeded with this production. I'm so happy. This must be the reason why people work so hard on theater shows. Min Woo, you were really awesome tonight. I'm looking forward to hearing what the reporters will say tomorrow! I don't think it's going to matter what others say. Because I was ready to do well on this stage without trembling once. I think I can do well in the future too. That's right, you will. Do you... really believe that? Yes, I really do. Gae Hwa. Yes? Do you want to come back and live in my house? Your house? Please become Ye Eun's mom. Her real mom. Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Main Translator: soluna413 Spot Translators: ai*, songbird Timer: avi14 Editor/QC: snoopyvkd Coordinators: mily2, ay_link How are things going with Min Woo? I must not have the confidence. To be viewed as a woman by anyone. What in the world have you done to Yoon Gae Hwa? Give her an official apology and plead for forgiveness. Apology? I'm telling you to do this as a man who loves Yoon Gae Hwa. I'll be waiting. Subtitles brought to you by Oh! My Lady Team at Viikii.net timing by Bemchu Min Woo, what shall I do? Ye Eun... She said she lost Ye Eun. The child doesn't speak to anyone. She won't be able to tell her name or age. Please find her. She's my daughter. Kae Hwa... What are we going to do if we can't find our Ye Eun? I shouldn't have sent her... I should have kept her with me. What will I do if we can't find Ye Eun? What will I do? - - If we can't find her? What will we do? If we can't find Ye Eun? We'll be able to find her. We will find her. No matter what, I will find her, so don't worry. Trust me. Ye Eun. Come here, my daughter. Shhhhhh.... It's going to get chaotic again tomorrow morning. Will you be all right by yourself? I am fine. It's late, you should get going. Let YeEun sleep here tonight, and from tomorrow, I'll take her with me. Rest, then. Kae Hwa, I'm unable to take you home. I'm sorry. I am fine. Please don't go. Don't go. Don't go, don't go. Please come back. Come back to me. That person has a hold of me. I really loved that person. It's a lie that I'm okay without that person. A lie, a lie. It's a lie. Really. Please don't go. Don't go. Please come back. Okay, let's eat breakfast. It's... a bit burnt, isn't it? Okay, let's cut it off. Whew! Is it yummy? Aigoo. you are beautiful. You have to listen to your teacher, today, too, mmmm? That's what makes you a good girl. Here... Here... Good looks are definitely in the genes, eh? Uh huh. You... You just replied, didn't you? You just spoke! Didn't you? Okay... My daughter, do a good job! Fighting. Oh, Sung Min Woo has arrived. What are you talking about? What do you mean a breanch of contract fine, when it's an uncomfirmed rumor? Hello. They called to cancel the fan meeting. And Producer Kim also asked to postpone the meeting. The electronics company that you modeled for, says that you violated the contract and want you to pay $3 million dollars (including penalties for their loss). What are you going to do? Just pay them out of my money. So you're going to pay and go broke, is that it? Fine. And we can cleanly sever our relationship as well. Then you should know that you'll have to get out of this apartment, too, right? Leave soon. Subtitles brought to you by Team Oh! My Lady of ViiKii.

[The pretty boy top star, Sung MinWoo is the father of a six year-old child.] The investor, from Western, may be generous, but he's also very picky. With this kind of scandal, we can't tell if he'll approve of Sung Min Woo being cast. How could you have hidden such a huge thing? I'm sorry. I didn't know things would come to this. I'm to blame for a lot of this. But if we stop and think about it, our production came this far because of Sung MinWoo. That was back when Sung MinWoo was cast because of his status as a top star. It's a different story now that he's the focus of such a big scandal. And this investor came on board without reference to Sung MinWoo. What do you think Chief will do? You're asking because you don't know Chief's disposition? I've already got a hunch. You came. The theater schedule is supposed to be set today, right? Yes, I'll follow through on it. Do it, and let me know. Chief... I'm worried... I heard that the investor takes a big interest in the casting... Then is there a chance that Min Woo ssi won't be able to perform? I'll find out when I meet with the investors. If you were to come out strong, Chief, wouldn't they be willing to listen to you? Since they're investing because of their trust in you. Did I have a reason to do that? You know how diligently Min Woo ssi has worked until now. Chief, if you were to block it.. Yoon Kae Hwa ssi... You do realize that you are overstepping the bounds of your position, don't you? You may have been the one to bring MinWoo on board, but whether or not he remains in the cast is not something that you should concern yourself with. Be sure to keep work and personal/emotional issues separate. Yes. I apologize. Yeah. It's Sung Min Woo. Can I talk to you for a moment? What's up? What's going to happen to me? "All That Love's" Sung MinWoo. Are you going to continue using him? All the pre-arranged productions, commercials, fan meetings, even food sponsorships, usually get cancelled when something like this happens. I'm curious about what The Show Co. will do. I can't give you a definite answer yet. As you said, your status is different now, so we'll probably have to consider recasting. I'm going to see what the casting director's and the investor's reactions are before deciding. That's all I can say to you for now. All right. I understand. Thank you for making time to meet me. What about you? I'd like to know where you stand. The circumstances don't make what I'm thinking very important, do they? Even if your ideas aren't important, you can still share what they are to someone else. These are the keys to the studio. There probably won't be anyone there in the evening. In any case, keep practicing. Because if you don't keep rehearsing, then you wouldn't stand a chance. The decision is up to you. [The recipient is unable to answer your call] [Busybody] It will be difficult for Sung MinWoo to overcome a scandal of this sort Look into the public relations papers and bring it back tomorrow. Yes. Thank you, Team Leader Oh. Well, you've got to watch the kid, so there's nothing else we can do. This is the rehearsal schedule. Make sure you pass the information along to the actors. Yes. Min Woo's not on the list. He should know, too. Apparently Chief already talked to him. Yes. Okay, let's put our bags down and wash our hands first. I'll get dinner ready. Oh? Mom, Did you buy crackers? Hm? There's really a lot here! MinWoo ahjusshi must have stopped by. We have to eat dinner before eating those. Wash your hands first. Okay. [Bad Actor] Mom! Ye Eun's clothes got wet. Oh, okay. Did Sung Min Woo return home? He hasn't come in today. Is that so? Min Woo. Did you call? Where are you? If your steps take you away... we will keep getting hurt. I cry without making a sound. I laugh without feeling self-conscious. I want to tell her not to leave, not to leave... But I swallowed the words back. Subtitles brought to you by Team Oh My Lady at Viikii.net Timing by Bemchu. Please have a seat. I've prepared some scenarios for you. It may seem like a lot, but if you go over it, it will give you a sense of what we're doing. That's fine. Yesterday, Yeon Hee, Ye Eun's mom, sent me a package. She wrote a letter asking me not to look for her anymore. Ye Eun's mom, was just one of many girls I dated at that time. I don't even have any special memories of her. Although I thought I loved her a lot at that time, after we split up, life was bearable. She was just another old flame. I didn't even know she was pregnant with Ye Eun. And the fact that Ye Eun was conceived from such a relationship. for some reason, to Ye Eun, I feel sorry (bad). I feel really apologetic towards Ye Eun. That she has such awful parents. It'll be fine if you're good to her in the future. That's probably why Ye Eun was sent to you. Will I be able to do a good job? I'm scared. A punk like me, someone who lived a whatever-kind of life. Will I be able to raise Ye Eun properly? My status as a star and all the money that went with it, I've lost it all and don't have a thing now. Will I be able to be a good father? I don't know anymore. You will be able to do a good job. The MinWoo-shi that I've come to know during all this time, will be able to do a good job. Don't be scared. Everything will work out. Buck up. (Be strong). How did you know I was here? You like this place. I thought you'd be here. I suppose we were a couple then. Since you were able to find me. Where did we start going wrong? I wonder.... What's wrong with you that you'd bring up such a topic? People do change... Your miscarriage... I really didn't even want to bring that topic up. Because of my difficult circumstances, you had to take on too much and so that's why it happened. How can a man not even take care of his child? I felt too mortified to voice my thoughts. In any case, I'm the one who lost the child. I thought it was my fault... I wondered if your obsession with work was because we didn't have a child. Or, if I should be grateful that we didn't have a child since you were naturally a workaholic. I don't know what came first, but in any case, in one corner of my heart, I always felt like I owed you something. A child.. a warm family, it's true that I regretted not having that. However, I liked that you were the number one choreographer. If I wanted both things, it would have been too selfish. I gave up on the idea of a child. But in the depths of my heart, it might have been that I never let it go. To be honest, that's the way it was. You.. are a little strange. what on earth makes you bring up all these things? So midly, talking at length. You seem like someone else. You're here? It's Choi Hyun Woo. The actor who can sell out all the tickets online in less than three minutes. What's with Choi Hyun Woo? He will be the lead actor. Organize his profile, and hand it over to Public Relations. How did you cast Choi Hyun Woo? This is his first musical. This is what the investors had up their sleeves. He's fresh and appealed to them. They got his agreement. Starting today, have him start rehearsing. Yes, I understand. Then Sung Min Woo's "out" It's a decision that's very Chief-like. He doesn't need human relationships and such. The important things are work, results and the final conclusion. The curtain... Is it... Yes. That's not Team Manager Yoon's usual facial expression. I am sorry, Chief. I'm not very good at hiding my feelings. Because of what happened, you must be feeling upset with me. From a work perspective, I agree that you had to do what you did. Only, Min Woo ssi has potential, too. Wasn't there any way you could have given him the chance? I feel that regret. How do you know he has potential? MinWoo-shi really worked diligently, you see. The light in his eyes are different. His eyes were full of determination. If a person has the determination to do something, they can change however much they need to. Do you know Min Woo that well? Well enough to notice a difference in his eyes. I believe in Min Woo ssi. You believe in him? Is that so? As the Chief of our company, your decision is bound to be more important. I'm just saying that, that's what I think. What did I tell you? I told you to get out while you were still a star. This is the drama that we tossed aside because the conditions weren't good enough. This time, it's not the lead, you're the second guy, but to begin with, let's just do this. Hyung, I'm not going to work with you anymore. What? Do you have the confidence to do it alone, without me? No. I don't have the confidence. I might throw another tantrum, and I wont have someone to take care of things for me. Making me drink, making me money... so that I'de get millions - I won't have anyone to do that for me, either. So, I don't have the confidence. But... I still want to try it alone. Why are you acting like such an amateur! You don't know this industry? You think you've hit rock bottom, don't you? You can fall a lot further! If you're unable to get back up, and just wander around, do you still think you'll have done a good job! ? ! That's true. It could turn out like that. But... if I keep living this way, I think I'll be too embarrassed. Now, I want to live a bit differently. Although I'm scared, I'm going to try it alone. This is Sung Min Woo. Please make some time to meet me. This is the place where I first met you, Chief. Isn't it? Saying you needed a star... Back then, I didn't even plan to look at the script. Just, the teacher that treated me like nothing, was showing up now because he needed me... I just wanted to show off. But now, I really want to do it. Not as a star, but as an actor. I want to do it. Do you have the confidence? Whether I do or not, I want to try. It's not that you succed at something because you have the confidence, but that you develop that confidence from having done something. Somebody once told me that. And you also said that too, didn't you? Whether I was a star, or some run-of-the-mill actor, that you wouldn't make the decision until the last rehearsal. Please keep your promise. You sure do make a request arrogantly. I guess I still haven't been able to get rid of my "star" attitude. Please give me a chance. Instead of waiting for your reply, I'm just going to get up. Whatever your answer is, I'm going to do it. Min Woo. You are here. I am sorry, Min Woo. Really. Apart from saying I'm sorry, I don't have anything to say. I really just wanted to get close to YeEun. That's why I took her. Really... I'll apologize with all the words I know. Sorry, Min Woo. It's okay. I found Ye Eun. That's enough. I heard that you had to pay a ton of money in breach of contract fines and that you lost all your roles? This all started because of me. It was something that was bound to come to light, and it had to be revealed. It's not because of you, so don't feel guilty. It was my fault for hiding it all this time. I lied to you, too. So, I am sorry, too. See... Our.. photo shoot. I think, for the time being, it's going to be postponed, too. I had a feeling it would be. You ... must really love Ye Eun a lot. I thought you'd dislike children and consider them a real nuisance. For some reason, it seems you've changed. What should I say? Like you've become a real adult. I wonder ... But Min Woo ... Can I ask one thing? Yoon KaeHwa and you...what's your relationship? Is it just pity for a single mom that is ... raising a child alone? Sympathy for her. Is that it? There's nothing else, right? No. No? What are you saying, "no" to? That there's nothing else between us. I don't think that's the case. I'm going to rehearsal. Subtitles brought to you by Oh! My Lady Team at viikii.net. --Timing by Bemchu-- Hey! This is big news! The woman who claims to be the mother of Sung MinWoo's child has given an exclusive interview! What? What are you talking about? An exclusive interview. I had Sung Min Woo's child. The woman who was hurt twice, by having his child. Will you tell me the whole truth now? It's getting even more out-of-control. This is getting dirtier and dirtier. That doesn't make any sense. Those are all lies. Whether or not they are, doesn't matter. It's Sung MinWoo's image. When the scandal keeps growing like this, what kind of investor is going to use him? Now I know why Western cut him. But that's not it... Who wrote that article? Oh! Yoon Kae Hwa ssi, on that day ... What the heck do you think you're doing? Yoon Kae Hwa ssi! Are you in your right mind? Yes, I'm perfectly sane! I'm a lot saner than you reporters who made up a story based on a mother who doesn't even exist. As far as I know, that child's mother, and MinWoo-shi, too. Neither of them are such weird people. Why do you make up your own interpretations of another person's sincerity? Just because it's someone else's story, don't do that. Like your spit out seeds, Is it all right for you to spit out whatever you want? Then, what about the parties concerned? Because of your unforgiveable greed, you write false articles. What if that ends up hurting the child, too? What will you do then? Who's going to take the responsibility for hurting that child? ! ? Also, what's wrong with him having a child? Min Woo ssi has been trying so hard to raise that child well. Isn't that enough, then? Why do you guys have so much to say about his image and his having kept it a secret or whatever? It's exactly because of something like this that he kept it a secret. You guys have even gone so far as to make up stories that don't exist. How could he have come out about it? Don't you think so? Hey! This ahjumma has a point. She talks well, too. What are you doing this? Why are you taking pictures of me, again? Then, who is the child's mother? How do you know about the child's mother? Please tell us. Please tell us. Ahjumma! Hurry! Hurry. Go! What? Just go! So, you're saying you dumped those pails of water on them? How could I not get furious when they made up such false stories? It's because of those articles that you can't even be in the musical. Min Wo ssi. Don't be too dis-spirited that you can't be in "All That Love". It's not like that's the only production out there. I'm not going to get dis-spirited. Do I look like the kind of punk who'd get so easily discouraged? You still don't know Sung Min Woo... That's right, eh? You won't get discouraged, right? That's definitely Min Woo ssi, for you. Min Woo ssi... Think of this as a time to re-charge and get lots of rest. Stars need to take occasional breaks too, in order for them to appear even more cool in the next production. The well-rested frog can jump farther, you know. Of all comparisons, did it have to be a frog? But, didn't the reporters get mad? Those reporters cameras are really expensive. If they get mad, what will we do if they write even nastier articles? Oh well, then.. Next time, I'll just dump dirty kithen water on them. If they write something about Ye Eun, or do something to her, then I'm not going to let them get away. But, MinWoo-shi, now it looks like it'll be tough for you to go home, again. Oh well... Then ahjumma, you'll have to take responsibility for me. What? Ahjusshi, you must have been very hungry. That's your third bowl. Mmmmmm, lately ahjusshi, hasn't been able to eat a decent meal. Ye Eun, you're enjoying your food, too, right? Shall I give you some side dishes? Here! Eat up. Ahjusshi, you seem like a really good dad. Huh? Min Ji, shall I give you some side dishes, too? Since I'm not a baby, that's unnecessary. Could you do something else for me instead? Aiyoo, Yoo Ra, drink slowly, will you? You finished this all by yourself, you know. Why would he have said that. I wonder, too. To be honest, your face is prettier that that lady's. your figure is nicer, your family background is better, and you even studied in the U.S. You're even younger than she is. Why is it that woman instead of you? I wonder. I don't know. That lady's been married before. She's even divorced. She even has a child, too. This is totally a case of ... Min Woo losing it or going crazy. It has to be one or the other. Ah, then ... Do they really love each other? They've lost it, or gone crazy. Then it really must be love. It seems so... Yoo Ra... Are you okay? Yeah.. But.. My heart hurts a little. Subtitlesbroughtto youbyTeam OhMy Ladyatviikii.net. --Timing by Bemchu-- We're finished, right? Yes, Chief Yoo. Yes. I understand. There are a ton of reporters here. Well, there was so much talk going around... Let's see what they can do, how far they ca go. -Let's go! -Yeah And, now, The Show Company's musical, "All That Love". We will introduce it to you. First of all, there will be an introductory statement from the producer, Chief Yoo. "All That Love" is a musical that I've been considering since I first started producing musicals. I feel great that I'm finally able to bring it to the stage. I request your favorable attention and interest in our performance. Thank you. Next, we will introduce the cast. The female lead, Lee So Young. Our supporting actress, Kim Mee Jung. The male lead, Choi Hyung Woo. And, Sung Min Woo. What is it? Please what kind of event is this? ... For the lead role, the actors Sung Min Woo and Choi Hyung Woo have been double-cast. So, Chief had this hidden card up his sleeve. Why are you getting so touched by this? Looking at you, people might think there's something going on between you and Sung MinWoo. He'll use the "card" that others have thrown out, eh? It looks rather classy. Looks classy, my foot. In any case, this Yoo ShiJoon always manages to do something like this... Oh, how irritating! I want to be a cooler man than hyung, more talented than hyung, better off than hyung... When did this ahjumma stop by? On his finger... There's no ring... Then ... Just because there's no ring on his ring finger, Doesn't mean he doesn't have a lover. Then should I just ask? I suppose he'd have one... I wanted to be a cooler guy than you, Hyung. To be more talented than you, hyung. To be more succesful than you, hyung. Hyung, I wanted to be a cooler man than you. Truly, I'm a really bad person. I didn't see her hurting... I didn't know her until it was too late. Why didn't I? Although I saw her and lived with her every day. Maybe her heart has gotten too weary. If I take one step forward, We'd just get more hurt. Icrywithoutmakingasound . I laugh without being self-conscious. From behid her, Don't leave, don't leave. I swallowed the words. I dream About our love. I pray, so that this will last forever. So that... I dream... about my future. I dream... I can't stop anymore. So that it will last..this love of ours... our dream. Subtitles brought to you by Team Oh! My Lady at Viikii.net. --Timing by Bemchu-- You did well. Min Woo... Min Woo.. Let me go! What are you doing? Nothing much... With all those obstacles toward the end, ultimately, we mad a success of this performance. I really feel overhelmed. It must be for this feeling that you put on a performance. Min Woo ssi. Today... you were really cool! I can't wait to find out what the reporters will say tomorrow. I don't think it will matter what others say. I...really without trembling on this stage even once, I was able to do a good job. I think in the future, I'll do even better. That's right. You will. Do you really.. have trust in me? Yes. Really. Kae Hwa ssi. Yes. Our house.. will you come back? To the house? Ye Eun... Please be her mother. Her real mother! Subtitles brought to you by Team Oh! My Lady at Viikii.net. --Timing by Bemchu-- Please do not make hard subbed videos with the work of Viikii volunteers. How are things going with you and Min Woo? I don't think I have the confidence, to appear as a woman to someone. What the heck did you do to Yoon Kae Hwa? Formally apologize and ask for her forgiveness. Apologize? I'm requesting this as a man who loves Yoon Kae Hwa. I will watch over her. 0_o So what exactly is your relationship with Ms. Yoon? Episode 13 We are meeting each other in a good relationship (meaning: we're meeting because we like each other). I hope you'll look favorably on the two of us dating. Thank you. Yoo Ra, release some of your tension. The shade of your face doesn't look too good right now. Unbelievable really! Move! If it's a good relationship it should be me. How is it that woman? ! Hey, Kae Hwa, sit down. Kae Hwa, what's going on? The press conference.. What was he talking about? ! I don't know. There were strange rumors about me so I'm guessing he did it in an attempt to save me. I wouldn't exactly consider this a remedy for the situation. He's literally pouring oil on the fire. Are you two, by chance.. You.. You aren't really dating each other, are you? Am I do? - I'm a truck driver. - Truck driver? In France or far away? Far away. In other countries? Yes, in countries. And"... What countries? I don't know. Countries in Europe, all over Europe. - What's your next country? - I don't know. - It's not interesting. - I'm interested. I'm interested. I'm not. Did I say something I shouldn't have? You don't want me to talk about this? No, but we can have secrets. It's weird. I just don't want to answer. - Why? - It's my right, isn't it? Yes, it's your right. You have every right. Still, it's weird. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - There is something. - No. - You're getting all worked up... - No, I'm not. I don't like to talk about myself. I'm not getting all worked up. I don't understand why you won't tell me. What? We had good sex, it was great. Now we're eating and you won't talk? What's wrong with you? Why won't you talk to me? I can leave if you want. Do whatever you want. You're a big boy. Yes. Then... Bye. This one's all blurry. Where was this taken? What is that house? You didn't see this house, only the other. I'll write down the date. Look how cute you were. I have to go get my medication tomorrow. I can give you a ride. - You don't have to work? - No, I quit. You quit your job? Stupid jobs like that are not something you can do for long. What are you going to do? I don't know, I'll see. I'll find something. It's not that easy to find a job. You don't have the luxury of choice. - Maybe it was a stupid job, but... - Not again. - It was well paid. - Leave me alone. I'll find something better, I said. You had a good job. I'm not the one who ruined it all. You think it's funny to be here looking for crappy jobs? Talking like your father doesn't make you right. What the fuck do you want? ! You want to drag me down? Yes, I'm an asshole. Your son is an asshole. Are you happy now? Fuck! - Your being upset means I'm right. - Will you shut the fuck up? ! You're pissing me off! You criticize everything I do. I'm fed up with it. Die with your fucking cancer. I won't have to see your ugly face anymore. - I'm fed up with this! - This isn't your home! I know that. You say it all the time! This place makes me want to puke. I want to puke when I see you eat, clean up everything, wear your slippers. You're crazy. You're completely insane! What's wrong with you? What's the matter? You want to piss me off? What's wrong with you? ! You want me to go back to prison? You want me to get in trouble? I'll punch you! I'll punch you! I don't give a damn. Stop pissing me off! Stop pissing me off! You want to stay here? I wouldn't mind tonight. You can stay as long as you want, you know that. It's just that... It makes me sad to see you like this. I don't care. She can die. You shouldn't say that. And she's right to piss me off the way she does? We know what we'll eat for lunch. I'll tell you something. Don't take it the wrong way. And then you were released, probably because your insurance ran out. But the official story is that you're now fit to live within society again. You just have to accept the truth. Wait. Give me a break. That made no sense. Yeah, it's me. No, I think they bought it. I had to do a little riffing at the end, but I was pretty convincing. Well, if it looks like I'm sneaking out the window, it's just a symptom of your deepening psychosis. - Don't hurt me. - Greendale doesn't exist? How long did you think we'd buy that? I'm literally carrying a Greendale backpack. I have, like, 1,000 pictures of the campus on my phone. I have children I see every day. I have definitely not been locked up. Get him. Why would you lie to make us think we were crazy? Because, Ms. Edison, Greendale is purgatory, and I am the devil. - What? - I knew it. Stop letting him make you realize stuff. These aren't even good lies. All right, fine, I had to come up with something. - You were getting too close. - Close to what? To the truth. The Indian kid was right. - He's Arabic. - Also Polish. Whatever. I'm a fake psychiatrist, not a fake ethnologist. The point is your Dean was kidnapped by Ben Chang and replaced with a double. I was hired to keep you off the scent. Chang kidnapped the Dean? Even for him, that's insane. Is it? Think about it. Whoo! I said hot damn! Chang... What are you doing? I'm predicting future crimes. Now I'm sick. See, you said that would happen. You are a pre-cog! Again. You're weak. Uh, guys, while we were remembering Chang is crazy, the fake doctor sneaked away. - Oh, crap! - What? There goes our only chance of clearing our names. You guys, forget about us. The Dean has been kidnapped. He's out there somewhere, alone and cold and most likely trying to cobble together a sexy Patty Hearst costume. Britta's right. Wait, what? We need to rescue the Dean. We need to get back to that school. And we definitely never need to do another paintball. - Yeah. - See, therapy does work. - We're cured. - Aw. Aw. Sounds like the study group has gotten wise to Operation Doppel-Deaner. It's time for phase two. What's phase two? Hey, I'm making up the same plan you are. Pitches, pitches, pitches.

Good morning. Amy: Well, how are the overnight guests doing? Ty: Ah, pretty good. Skeeter made it through the night without chewing on his sutures. (Laughs) Well, that's progress. Ty: Yeah, I think I'm starting to go crazy though, being in this clinic for over twenty-four hours. Well, how about I come by in a little bit? Yeah, that'd be awesome. Okay. I should run, but I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. All right, Lobo, come on! Let's go get some breakfast! Come on! What would you say if I raised my babysitting fees to twenty-five dollars an hour? Lou: I would say you're pricing yourself out of the market. But that's how much I need if I'm gonna be renting an apartment in Hudson. An apartment? Yeah, just a one room, or a bachelor, but it has to have a dishwasher. I'm gonna take a wild guess that you haven't talked to your parents about this? No, because I'm never talking to them again. Mallory, maybe moving to Nashville won't be so bad. You should think of it as an adventure. Going to Bora Bora is an adventure. Moving to Nashville is the worst thing that's happened to me-- Ever.

Muddy paws; I just washed this kitchen floor. Plus, he's always trying to eat Katie's food off of her tray. Yeah, but Katie loves him. Don't you, Katie? Hmm? Lou: He's cute, but he's going outside where he belongs. Can I borrow five thousand dollars? Excuse me? Never mind. Lou: You know, if Lobo won't sleep outside, you should ask Grandpa to like build him a dog house or something. Where is Grandpa anyway? Ah! Refer to the very informative note on the fridge. "Be back later this afternoon. Grandpa." Yeah, and I'm pretty sure I heard his truck leaving the yard around midnight last night. Midnight; That doesn't seem like Grandpa. Hello, Miranda.

Ever since you showed up at my door last spring, I've had nothing but problems, and I have the legal bills to prove it. I have no intention of coming between you and your son. But Shane's not gonna be a boy forever and you're only gonna be able to keep him away from Tim for so long. Is that a threat? No, that's a fact. When Shane gets older, if he wants to find his father, he will. But by then, I'm afraid, there won't be a father to find. Not the one he remembers anyway. What are you saying? We have something in common, you and me. We both knew the old Tim; The one I kicked out of the house. The same guy you met in Fort St. John. (Huffs) He's off the wagon, isn't he? I'm sorry to say. So what? Why should I care? Well, because if things get any worse, your son's gonna have a broken-down drunk for a dad, and no amount of lawyers or courtroom battles are gonna protect him from that kind of heartbreak, and you know that. What is it you want me to do, Jack? (Low hum of chatter, dishes and cutlery clank) Lobo! Lobo! Lou: Mallory, have you seen where the extra baby wipes went? What's going on here? Oh, nothing. I thought I'd just prepare a little something for lunch. Is that a quiche? Quiche Lorraine to be exact. Wow. What's the occasion? No occasion. You're a hard-working mother in the middle of a highly stressful move, and your equally busy husband is away on a business trip. You barely have time to breathe, let alone prepare a healthy meal. So sit down and enjoy. Thank you. And don't forget to leave room for dessert. I made a creme brulee that is to die for. You made a creme brulee? Mallory: A secret recipe. I found it on a blog called... "Secret recipes." Clearly, a well-kept secret. Bon appetit! Wow, Mallory, this looks amazing. Thank you. Are you going to join me? No, thank you. I think I'm gonna get a head start on the laundry, and then after that there's silverware that should be polished. No, there isn't. Oh, then I'll just iron the bedsheets. Okay, Mallory, what's going on? Nothing. This is just an example of what your life could be like with a live-in domestic engineer. Mallory... You won't even have to pay me. I'll work for room and board. And think about all the money you'll save on daycare. What about school? I'll multi-task. What about your parents? I'll get... emancipated. (Sighs) Believe me, I wish you didn't have to move away, Mallory. I'm gonna miss you like crazy, and so is Katie. But I don't think this is a very realistic solution. I know. It was worth a shot. I guess I'm back to Plan A: Saving up money for rent for an apartment. And how exactly are you going to do that? I'm gonna charge you $75 dollars for the quiche. Yeah, I don't think so. But I'll pay you twenty bucks to help me move my junk out of the Quonset hut. Done. (Hamster squeaks, cat meows nearby) I hope you're hungry! Perfect! I am starving. Thank you. What're you working on? Uh, just my vet school applications. I thought you sent those in days ago. I was going to, but uh... But...? This guy in my genetics class is bragging about all of his academic awards. So? So I don't have any academic awards. Yes, but Ty, you have tons of work experience. Yeah, and so does the guy in my genetics class, and this is his third time applying. But he's not you. I know... Come on. Ty: I have good grades, and I think I'm a pretty good vet assistant, but that's not enough to get into vet school. What if it's a waste of time and money? You're just getting cold feet. Any university would be lucky to have you. You're gonna be a great vet. I gotta go. What, you're not gonna eat with me? Lobo ran away this morning, so I'm gonna take Spartan out to look for him. Are you sure? I was gonna let you feed Lady Gouda some sesame seeds. You get those applications finished. (Sighs) Oh! It's my old mini-fridge. So many memories... Your memories smell like stale beer and mouldy pizza. Isn't it beautiful? Mallory: Lou, come on. I'veheardof nostalgia, but taking pictures of old college appliances, isn't that going too far? It's not for me, Mallory. I'm selling all of this stuff online. Mallory: Seriously? Who is gonna buy this junk? Are you kidding me? There is always someone looking for a deal. Last week I made three hundred bucks selling Peter's old bachelor furniture. Three hundred bucks? Mm-hmm! And every penny's going right back into renovating our new house. Lou, you're a genius! Well, I wouldn't say genius. But did I ever tell you that I was hired by Strickland and Cook even before I graduated from college? And everyone knows I would've been high school Valedictorian, if it wasn't for Mary Jane Stupka and her stupid GPA, which was one percent higher than mine. I mean, seriously, one percent. Mallory? ! I want my twenty bucks back! Tim: All right, all right, I'm here. What's so damn important you had to bring me all- Jack: Just come in here and sit down. Tim: Just tell me what's going on, Ja-! Hello, Tim. Tim: What're you doing here? Where's Shane? Staying with a friend. I asked Miranda to come here, Tim. What're you even involved for? I got a lawyer for a reason. I don't know that your lawyer's acting in your best interest. Tim: Well, it's none of your business, old man. What did he tell you? That you need help. Well, you can go to hell, and you can go to hell. 'Cause whatever he told you is a lie. I know he's telling the truth, because the man I'm looking at right now, reminds me a lot of the man I dumped in Fort St. John. I don't need this crap. I shouldn't have come. (Bottle cap screws into place) I'm getting tired of you, Jack. Give it a rest, huh? My lawyer is this close to getting custody of that kid. You must be really drunk, if you believe that. Keep this up, and not only are you gonna lose Shane, you're gonna lose your daughters too. Miranda is good enough to come here. Don't mess this up, Tim. Lobo! Lobo? ! (Whistles) Lobo! (Birds chirp) Amy: Hey! There you are! (Lobowhines) Lobo! (Lobo whines and pants) Where have you been, huh? What're you doing? (Lobo whines) Okay... What happened? (Lobo whines) (Lobo whines) Ty: It's a bullet wound. What? Ty: Yeah, you can see the entrance wound on the other side of his chest, and here's where it exited. Oh my God... Who would do something like that? Ty: Some rancher probably thought he was a wolf. You know how trigger happy they get when they're trying to protect their livestock. Well, he's got a good heartbeat, that's good. The bullet went in high enough that it missed his heart. He's a pretty lucky dog. So are you gonna call Scott? He's out of town for the weekend. Dr. Miller's filling in for him. He just left for the McKnight farm a few hours ago. He should still be in range. Dr. Miller, it's Ty. I'm at the clinic. We've got a bit of an emergency here, if you can call me back when you get this? Thanks. Bye. Amy: So what do we do? We gotta take him to the emergency clinic in Calgary. Ty, that's over an hour away. I know, but everything else is closed on Saturday. (Lobo whines) Okay, here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna staple up the wounds - I've seen Scott do it a hundred times. If Dr. Miller doesn't call me back by the time I'm done, at least he won't be bleeding all the way to Calgary. What can I do? Clip the hair around the wounds, okay? - Okay. - Keep him calm. (Clippers buzz) Hey, Lou. Hey, stranger. Can I give you a hand here? Here, why don't you take Katie. Okay, I'd love to. Hello, sweetheart. Hello. So where have you been? Your note was very mysterious. Yeah, I'm sorry about disappearing like that. I ended up driving out to Moose Jaw. Moose Jaw? ! Does this have something to do with Miranda? Did you have fun shopping for groceries with mommy? Grandpa? Yeah. Yeah, it has something to do with Miranda. As a matter of fact, she's in the house right now. What? Miranda is here? Are you kidding- She might be staying overnight at the dude ranch, if that's okay. Grandpa, what is going on? Your dad is not dealing with this custody situation all that well. Why don't you give me that, and, come on, honey, we'll go in the house. And we'll read a book, just you and me, okay? Can you help me with this? So this is why you wanted a ride? What? I know you said you needed to make money, Mallory, but busking? Really? I don't even know how to play the guitar. This is gonna be a disaster. Jake, I'm not busking! So what's it for then? I'll tell you on the way. Well, where exactly are we going? This is the address, okay? But you might want to step on it 'cause I was supposed to be there five minutes ago. You know, Miranda, I'm really glad you came back here. Yeah, well, Jack can be very persuasive. Can I ask you a question? Of course. All those years ago, back in Fort St. John, were you in love with my dad? Oh, um... Well, you have a daughter, so... You know what it's like to be suddenly responsible for a tiny human being. Whether or not I loved your dad, Shane became my world. And back then, your father, well, he had some problems. He still does, and I still have to protect my son. You make it sound like my dad's some kind of a monster Shane needs to be protected from. No, he's not a monster, but he's a different person when he's drinking. Um, I'm sorry, back up. Who said anything about drinking? All right... Well, that should do it. Okay, let's get going. (Lobo whines) Wait... Something's wrong. (Panting rapidly) What is it? His breathing, it's not right. Amy: What's happening? I'm not hearing good lung sounds. There might be some air in his chest cavity from the bullet wound. - That doesn't sound good. - No it's not. Uhm... Here, can you put this on him? Amy: It's okay. It's okay, Lobo. Good boy. - Ready? - Yeah... what's going on? Ty I don't know. Okay. what do we do? Um... Ty? Just let me think ok? (Door Knocking) Tim: Miranda? Open the door! (Banging loudly) Miranda! (Door bangs shut) I know why you're here. 'Cause Jack gave you some overblown story about how I've been drinking again, right? So you came to see for yoursef if I'm an unfit father? Well, I hate to disappoint you, I'm fine. Really? You didn't sound fine in that message you left me last week. What message? You don't remember, do you? God... That's unbelievable. I knew this was a bad idea. We're gonna leave this to our lawyers. Look, Shane has not been the same since he came back, okay? He's angry, he's getting into fights, and comes home late from school and he doesn't wanna tell me where he's been. He used to be such a sweet boy, and now he's... He's what? I'm tired, Tim. I'm so tired of fighting with you! I'm tired of fighting with Shane! I'm... I'm just so tired. (Door creaks open and clicks shut) Guy: There you go. Mallory: Thanks. Guy: Thanks. Check it out. Five thousand dollars for a guitar? It was vintage or something. Well, where'd you get it from? Your dad? Yeah. I put it online and then like an hour later some guy from the music store emails me and offers me five thousand big ones. You know what this means? It means that I can get an apartment in Hudson! I don't have to move to Nashville any more! Oh my gosh! Let's go pick out affordable Swedish furniture! (Hedging sigh) What? Nothing, it was just... Something about that guy. I don't know, he seems kinda shifty. He works at the music store. He's not shifty, he's, you know, cool. I don't know, but... We should cash that cheque before we do anything. Fine! First, we go to the bank and then we go to the furniture store. You should've told me about dad, and you should've told Amy. Yeah, I know. I guess I just didn't wanna believe it myself. Yeah, well... The funny thing is, I think I knew. I mean, all the signs were there. Well, it's been a tough year for your dad. So you're making excuses for him? No! I'm not making excuses, but... This whole Shane thing has turned his world upside down. So you brought Miranda here, what, to fix him? To show him what he has to lose. Now, if they can work things out, maybe your father will find his own way out of this. And if they can't? Grandpa, I'm sorry, but I am not gonna sit by and watch him tear this family apart again. (Phone rings) (Phone beeps on) Yeah. Hello. Wha... Amy, slow down. Oh my God. Is he okay? Amy: We don't know yet. Lou, I really gotta go. No, just stay there. We'll call you if we need anything, okay? Bye. His lungs are collapsed. So we keep him on oxygen? Uh... no, it's not gonna help; His chest can't expand so... Amy: 'Kay. What do we do? We gotta get the air out of his chest. - How? - I don't know. I've never seen Scott do anything like this before. Um... Why isn't Dr. Miller calling me back? Ty, we need to get him to the emergency clinic. We can't go to the clinic; Lobo can't breathe. We're not gonna make it there in time. You don't look like a girl who just cashed a cheque for $5000 dollars. That's because it bounced. I knew he was shifty. It's probably just a mistake; A temporary cash flow issue. Let's just go back to the music store and clear this all up. Don't look at me like that, Jake! Everything's fine. Now, let's go! (Door closes) Tim: Hello! Oh! Something smells good in here. Let's see what we have. (Chuckles, pleased) Oh, baby... Mmm! (Deliberate knife slices) Hello to you, too! Okay, okay, if this is about.. Me not being there to help you with this move of yours, Lou, I'm sorry, I've been tied up. I'll make it up to you, I promise. Do me a favour. Don't make me any promises, dad. Okay. When I was fifteen, you promised I'd see you again and you walked out the door and I didn't see you for ten years, so... What're you talking about this for, Lou? This is ancient history. I'm not going anywhere. Well, I hope that's true, dad, I really do, but, um, I don't know how I'm supposed to trust you. You can trust me. No, dad, I can't! Not when you're drinking. No... Okay, if your grandfather told you something, he's blowing this way out of proportion. I don't want you to see Katie any more. - Lou! - No, I... If you're gonna leave again, then I don't want you to see her any more because it'll just be easier that way, all right? Don't do this! I'm fine! I swear I'm fine! You better be. (Tearing up) And if you're not, then get help! There's dinner if you're hungry. (Door chime jingles) Can you believe this? The manager of the store hasn't heard of the guy I sold the guitar to. He doesn't even work there. I can spot shifty from a mile away; That guy was shifty. What am I gonna do? Well, you're gonna have to call your dad. - No. - Why not? Because I can't. He doesn't know about your plans to move out, does he? Not exactly. Well, then I guess... You're gonna have to phone the police. No! They'll just tell my parents and they can't find out about this. You have to promise not to tell them! I promise. This is a disaster. I'm an idiot. I really am moving to Nashville, aren't I? Okay, here it is. We need a three-way stop valve. It should be in that drawer underneath the clipboard. Okay. Uh... is this it? - Yeah, that's it. - 'Kay, what else? Uh, we need a syringe, and a needle and catheter. Where's that? Just in that drawer on the left right beside, yup. - Okay. Amy: Okay. Ty: Thank you. Can you also get the drapes ready right there? - Yeah. - Thank you. You're gonna be okay, boy, you hear me? You're okay. Jack, do you have a second? Yeah, I guess. I think I did something really bad. How bad? Pretty bad; Like against the law bad. Okay, start at the beginning. My dad has this vintage guitar and I sort of... borrowed it. You borrowed it. Okay, I stole it. Why would you do something like that? I was desperate! I was really just gonna sell some of my old things online, but then I saw the movers packing up my dad's office and I thought to myself, it's now or never, Mallory. This moment is gonna define the rest of your life! All right! Just get to the point. All right... I knew my dad wouldn't miss his guitar until he was in Nashville, but by then I'd have already sold it and I'd be living in my own apartment, with a dishwasher, in Hudson. You sold the guitar? Yes... But then the cheque bounced. What were you thinking? Why do I have to move my entire life to Nashville? This is my home. It's not fair! So you think it's not fair! That doesn't justify stealing! I'm sorry, Jack. I really am sorry. Please don't be disappointed in me. I know... it was wrong, but my parents are wrong too. How could they be doing this to me? (Door closes) Tim: Room service. Miranda: Hi. I-I'm not really hungry. Well, Lou put this together for you. I'll just leave it here. Save it for later. (Fire crackles) Do you wanna sit? Tim: Yeah, I got a minute. So what're we gonna do about Shane? And please don't mention lawyers because if this goes to court, I'm gonna win and you know it! You're holding all the cards; Why don't you tell me? I want Shane to have a father. He has a father. Miranda: (Disagreeing) Mmm. Not the kind that leaves me threatening messages on my voice-mail. (Mumbling) Yeah, sorry about that. Well, that won't happen again. It's cold in here. You cold? No, I'm fine. Let me get you a blanket. No, I'm fine. Really. I'll fix this fire up. (Kindling clatters) You know, that smells really good; Maybe I am hungry. Here, here. I'll get it, I'll get it. (Fire crackles) Thank you. No, there are no onions in it, I checked. (Chuckles) You remember? Yeah! Shane doesn't like onions either. No, Shane doesn't like most vegetables, except maybe for corn. Yeah, but it has to be out of the can; Can't be frozen. (Laughs) Yeah, he hates frozen. He likes broccoli. - No. - Yeah. Yeah, Lou made this broccoli casserole; He couldn't get enough of it. You gotta get that recipe. Yeah, I guess I do. Better set another place; Mallory's joining us for dinner. Can I spend the night, Lou? So long as it's okay with your parents. Jack: I'll give 'em a call. You're not gonna say anything, are you? Well, not tonight. But tomorrow morning you will. Is that clear? Mallory: Yes, Jack. Lou: Yeah, go ahead. What was that about? Well, it's a long story. I'll fill you in later. Have you heard from Amy? No. Not yet. Okay, attach the stop-valve to the syringe. Ty: Okay. Amy: Make sure it's in the off position. It's off. Now you have to insert the needle into the chest. (Oxygen hisses) So... What? There's a lot of blood vessels in the chest, and if I was to hit one, that would be uh... That would be bad. Then don't hit a blood vessel then. Right. Okay, the intercostal blood vessels lie just... Back from each rib, so from the front side... Right here. You can do this. Okay, it's in. The syringe, I'm opening the valve. Okay... Here goes nothing. It's working. The air's coming out. Amy: It's okay, boy. And again. How he's doing? The same. Okay, we keep going. Keep going. That's it; That's all the air out of his chest. That's all we can do. (Oxygen hisses) We should've taken him to the clinic. Ty, you made the right choice. You did everything you could. (Sighs heavily) Miranda: When was the last time we just sat together and talked. I don't know. Fort St. John? (Laughs) What? - Oh, nothing. - What? What? Nothing. I'm just... Thinking about that bar where I met you. (Groans) What was the name again? Jamie's. It was a dump. I remember the line you used on me. Tim: It must've been good; I was pretty smooth back then. (Laughing) Smooth is not the word I would use. You came up to me and said, um, my friend over there wants to know if you think think I'm handsome. Yeah. It's a good line. It's not a good line. It's sad and pathetic. (Laughs) Well, I remember what you said. You said to me, you go tell your friend that I've seen better. I did? Tim: (Laughing) Yeah. Well, that's a great line. (Tim and Miranda both laugh) I wouldn't worry about Shane fighting in school. That's just... That's what kids do. Shane is a sensitive boy. He's not like the other kids in his class. He's a lot tougher than you think he is. You should've seen him rope steers this summer. He was getting pretty good at it. Rodeo's his new obsession, thanks to you. Well, he's his father's son. Yeah, well, he has other interests, you know. Like last summer, he went to writing camp. Riding camp... Writing camp. They have a camp for that? They have a camp for everything now - and he had the time of his life, but... He didn't tell you that. Well, no. I don't care if he went to writing camp or science camp or... I just want a chance to be his father. I believe you. Now you just have to prove it. Well, how do I do that? Well, this is a good start. (Fire crackles) (Dog barks out back, cats meow) Amy: Ty! Ty, come in here! He's awake and I think his breathing is better. Okay. Easy, boy... Easy. Yeah. Oh, he's definitely sounding a lot better. (Lobo growls, Ty laughs) Yeah! And his gums are nice and pink; That means there's oxygen in the blood. So he's gonna be all right? Yeah, I think so. (Lobo growls softly, Ty laughs) (Phone rings) Dr. Miller. Yeah, my girlfriend came in with her dog. He has a pneumothorax. I took the air out of his chest and he seems to be stable now. I did it by myself, and I'm sorry, I know I overstepped my boundaries, but we didn't think we could get him to the emergency clinic. Okay. No, thank you. Um... Well, Scott's a good teacher. Okay. Okay. He's on his way right now. He said I did everything he would've done. (Laughs) (Sighs, relieved) (Amy sighs) (Softly) Lou. Amy, hey... Hey. What're you doing in here? I wanted to make sure I saw you when you got home. Um, how's Lobo? He pulled through, thanks to Ty. That's great. I am so exhausted. I think I could probably sleep for a week. Yeah, I don't blame you... (Clears throat) But um... Amy, there's... There's something I need to tell you about dad. Dad? (Birds chirp) (Cell phone rings) (Cell phone rings) Hello? Be right there. (Phone beeps off) Jake, your eye. That's nothing; Just a scratch. What happened? I tracked down your dad's guitar. How? The music store manager did some searching; The guy who tried to rip you off was trying to resell your guitar online. I asked him to set up a meeting, I showed up, and we had a little chat. Well, by the look of your face, you did more than just talk. Like I told you, he was shifty. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to drag you into all of this. You don't have to be sorry. (Sighs) I'll get you some ice for your eye. No, it's fine. I'm gonna get going. This is the sweetest thing that anyone's ever done for me. Thank you. (Gasps) Hold that thought. One of these days, I'm gonna take you on a proper date: Dinner, flowers, the whole deal. Jake, I'm moving away. You'll be back. You have a nice day, now. (Birds twitter loudly outside, door closes) (Groans quietly) (Footsteps thud lightly) (Door closes) (Blows warm air on his hands) (Birds chirp and twitter, wind gusts lightly) (Truck rumbles) (Screws cap back on bottle) Hey. Amy. (Sighs) Is everything all right? Yeah. I just wanted to see you. I love you, dad. I love you too, honey. You know everything's gonna be just fine, right? I believe you. (Choked up breaths) I should go. Okay, okay. See you. Okay, bye. (Truck door opens and shuts, engine fires up) (Truck rumbles away) (Bottle slides across the ground) Come on. (Liquor splatters on the ground) (Bottle lands with a soft thud in the snow) (Sighs heavily) Jack: Boy, that is one amazing guitar. Okay. You know what you have to do. I got the guitar back. Can't we just pretend that none of this ever happened? Fine, let's just get it over with. Hey, Dad. Uh, I'm fine. I have something to tell you. Are you sitting down? So I'll call you as soon as I get to Moose Jaw. Okay, okay. You better drive safely. The weather looks like it's turning a bit. Yeah, I will, thanks. Okay. You know, I can't remember the last time I stayed up all night and talked like that. (Laughs) Me either. (Sighs) Me either. Okay- Well, I have a long drive ahead of me, so I'll... I'll get going. - Bye. - All right. Bye. (Door closes, car starts up) Hey. I got a crazy idea. Why don't you just stay another night? We'll talk. (Cats meow, birds chirp, mice squeak) All right, Lady G, lunchtime. (Dog barks) Hey, Bella, look what I got for you! Huh? What's this? What's this? You want it? (Bella groans) Yeah, a new chew toy for you! (Lobo pants) All right... How's he doing? I think he's pretty much back to his old self, thanks to you. Yeah, Lobo... Well, Dr. Miller's got him on some antibiotics. We're gonna keep an eye on him. If there's no infection, you should be able to take him home pretty soon. Oh... you hear that, Lobo? You hear that?

Announcer: Will it be A fairytale ending? Heartland, the season finale, Next Sunday at 7:00 on CBC. Dude, let's water them later. No! We're watering Margaret's plants now! - You're so whipped. - No, I'm not. Yeah right! You're whipped with a capital... Just help me water the plants! This place is awesome! Aw, yeah! Grill! After we start dating, I'll totally invite you over for burgers. Whatever! Can we just get this over with so we can leave? Chill, dude! I can't believe Margaret asked us to water her plants while she's gone for the weekend. I think this really shows a level of trust. I think you're reading too much into it. All she did was ask you to water her plants. Yeah, well, I don't see anyone asking you to water their plants. Man, she's got a lot of plants! I can't believe you told her you'd water all these. What a chump. It's because Margaret's my friend. Yeah, your friend without benefits. Hey, shut up and help me find the watering can. Agh, the bedroom door's locked! It wouldn't be in her bedroom! Stay out of there! Oh, Mordecai, he's alright. It's not like we're dating or anything. I just let them come over and water my plants sometimes. Hey, put that back! No. I wanna wear it while I water the plants. - Put it back! - Make me. Get off of me! I wanna wear it while I water the plants! Dude, what did you do? ! What do you mean, what did I do? ! You pushed me! Dude, you broke it! Yeah right, you can't break books! And besides, even if it did break, just put it back and don't say anything! Dude, you totally broke it! Look, this thing has a lock on it. What? What kind of book has a lock on it? I don't know. Oh no. - What? - This is Margaret's diary! Dude, she's gonna think I was reading her diary! This is bad. Dude, what's the big deal? It's just some lame old diary! I mean, why do people even need to keep secrets? I don't have any secrets. Do you have any secrets? I know I sure don't. I don't care! If she comes home and finds this thing broken, she's gonna think I read it! We have to fix it before she gets back. Come on, come on. Will you chill out? It's not gonna stick without glue. Agh, looks like Rigby has to bail you out again. Aw yeah, "Supe the Glup." - Dude, just a drop. - I know. - Just a drop! - I know! Dude, I said "Just a drop!" You were making me nervous! Aw man! Let me see that glue. Ok, ok, ok. It says here we can remove the glue with heat. Let me handle it. Wait. We're not putting anthing in the microwave. - Dude, it's working. - Yeah, it is. I got it. I got it. Dude, that's not--! You think she'll notice? Can you fix it? What is this? It's Margaret's diary. Why does it look like that? It's a long story. Sorry, this can't be fixed without traditional methods. Well do you have any un-traditional ones? Of course. There is one way, I could transfer to a new diary using a magic quil pen. Thank you, Skips. In order for this to work, we have to be in the same place where the diary was broken. Margaret's house. But first I want you both to know is that diaries are a serious business, cause they can contain secrets. And secrets must be protected at all cost. - Yeah Skips we know. - Do you? Look, out of respect for Margaret's secrets, I'm gonna help you guys. But, you have to take it seriously and do exacty as I say. - Yeah, Skips, we promise. - Yeah, we promise. Well you better, because secrets are a force to be reckoned with. Ah, what? ! That doesn't look anything like Margaret's diary. As in written content, so too in physical appearance, will the books become identical. Alright, guys, join hands. I'm not gonna hold hands! C'mon, dude, just do it, he's tryin' to help us out. Fine. Okay, it's time to begin. Now, no matter what ya hear, you musn't look at Margaret's thoughts as the quill transfers the secrets. Now we must all close our eyes. Rigby, close your eyes. Fine, I'm closin' em. Begin. What're they saying? Just keep your eyes closed and ignore them. HOW MUCH LONGER IS THIS GONNA TAKE? ! It should be any minute, just keep your eyes closed! Cool. The transfer is incomplete. Did everyone keep their eyes shut? I kept mine shut! What? ! Alright, fine! There's a chance I might've maybe probably looked. Maybe. RIGBY! Do you have any idea what you've done? ! What is that? It's coming from outside. Margaret? ! That's not Margaret. When Rigby looked-- I SAID MAYBE LOOKED, MAYBE! He released the Guardian of Margaret's Secrets. She will destroy us for looking at her secrets. What do we do? ! There's only one way to stop this. Each of us must reveal a secret of our own, or she'll destroy us. Alright. I'll go first. The reason I always skip is, in all my life, my heart yearned for only one woman. And we used to skip together all the time. On the day I lost her, I vowed to skip every day for the rest of my life, so that I'd never forget the time we spent together. I-IT'S WORKIN'! NOW TELL YOUR SECRETS! Okay... sometimes when we're supposed to be cleaning out gutters, we go to get coffee instead! Yeah, yeah, good one! And a lot of times, I don't even get coffee! I just don't feel like cleaning out the gutters! No, it has to be something meaningful! HOW MEANINGFUL DOES IT HAVE TO BE? ! IF YOU DON'T TELL A REAL SECRET, WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE! ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT! I LIKE TO SING ALONG TO REALLY BAD POP MUSIC! I ATE A DOUGHNUT OUTTA THE TRASH! I LIKE GOING COMMANDO! A LOT! I ACUALLY LIKE THE TASTE OF DOUGHNUTS BETTER WHEN THEY'RE FROM THE TRASH! RIGBY! REMEMBER WHEN WE ORDERED BEDS FOR OUR ROOM AND YOUR'S NEVER SHOWED UP? ! I LIED! I STACKED THEM UP AND I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ON THEM THE WHOLE TIME! I'M SORRY, DUDE, IT'S JUST TOO COMFORTABLE! Are you serious? RIGBY! SAY SOMETHING! WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I STOLE MY NEIGHBOR'S BIKE WHEN THEY'RE FROM THE TRASH! IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING DEEP! SOMETIMES I HIDE POPS' SHOES CAUSE I THINK IT'S FUNNY WHEN HE'S LOOKING FOR THEM! I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON! I HATE TAKING SHOWERS AND I KATE KITTENS! I LIED ABOUT BEING ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM! I THINK EILEEN IS HOT WITHOUT HER GLASSES ON! Let's finish this! It looks exactly like Margaret's! Skips, how can we repay you? You remember that stuff I said about why I skip? - Yeah. - No, ya don't. I knew it was my matress. So, Eileen, huh? STOP TALKING! I can't believe we got the diary back together. Yeah, what a pain. I never wanna water Margaret's plants ever again. Wait, did we actually ever water her plants? Here she comes! Oh, hey Margaret! How was your trip? It was nice, but i can only take my parents for so long, you know? Tell me about it, 'rents are the worst. Well, you don't have to worry about your plants, or if the roof is still on your apartment, or whatever. Because it's fine is what I meant. You guys didn't go and water them, did you? Yeah, why? I forgot that I already asked Eileen to do it. Really? Yeah, she had the spare bedroom all weekend. Sorry you guys went through all that trouble. I guess we just missed each other, - so don't worry about it. - Yeah, it's cool. Hey, guys, here's your coffee. Hot in Cleveland is recorded in front of a live studio audience. Oh, there you are, Elka. I brought the loot. We've been over this, Mamie Sue. "Loot" makes it sound like we're pirates. I'm sorry. I got the Benjamins. It's all about the Benjamins. What are you doing with all that money? What money? Elka, what the hell is going on? Well, if you must know, we've started a business. It's a dating service for seniors. Right? Sure. It's called Cleveland... GILFS. Uh... Grandmothers I'd like to friend. So that's what all the secrecy has been about? That's why you're back in school getting a business degree? Yep, that's why. That's a good idea. It is a good idea. And a great cover for our real business. And maybe I could use it to meet someone. And then I could double date with you and Pierre. Oh, I'd be nervous bringing another guy on a date with Pierre. You're right, we might end up both going home alone. Oh, honey, were you up all night? How could I sleep? I'm losing my mind. Okay, worst-case scenario: Your boss overheard you say you're in love with him. Now he's on vacation with his girlfriend, laughing about it. And when Chloe, his ex-wife... also your boss... finds out, you'll be humiliated, alone, and fired. [Forced laugh] Oh, God, if I wasn't catholic and didn't have two kids and I didn't have a dentist appointment tomorrow that would be so rude to cancel this late, I'd kill myself. I know, I'll send him a text and tell him it was all a joke. Oh, I don't know, Melanie. No, no, no, no. This is good, this is good. I'll say it was an elaborate prank. I punked him. And send. That'll fix it. No, it won't. Why would I pull such an elaborate prank? And how could I know that he'd overhear me? And why did autocorrect change "punked" to "puked"? And now Alec and his girlfriend Carmen have something else to laugh about in between bouts of lovemaking. I could just see it now... Her on top of him... How do you know she's on top? It's early in the day. She doesn't want to mess up her hair. Okay, so what should I do? Call Victoria. She's always good for an asinine scheme. No, no, I don't want to bug Victoria. It's her first day of rehearsal. You're right. I'm sure she's busy doing something asinine already. An excellent question, Barbara. How do I feel being in my first Woody Allen movie, starring opposite Sir Emmet Lawson? How don't I feel? [Knock on door] Victoria, are you in there? Oh, uh, yes, Emmet. Come in. Terrific job this morning, my love. Brava! Oh, you really mean it? You are the real deal, kid. Oh, coming from you, that means so much. You can't imagine. [Chuckles] I've also got something to tell you. [Cell phones buzz] Oh... Excuse me. Just my Google alert. Yeah, mine too. Oh, my God. TMZ is reporting that we are having an affair. That's what I came to tell you. Yes! Oh, oh! [Mimicking passionate moans] Yes! Don't ever stop! Hey, you think 'they're buying it out there? Oh, trust me. Half the crew is on the phone to TMZ already. Nothing like a bit of juicy gossip to keep your name in the papers and get your movie trending. I'm getting a little nauseous. How much longer do we have to keep doing this? It's only been three minutes. I have my reputation to think of. Oh. You're really good at this whole fake relationship thing. - Do you do this regularly? - Oh, absolutely. I once carried on a six-month romance - with Helena Bonham Carter. - Oh. Never met her. - Big finish? - Please. [Both moaning] Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! [Both cry out in unison] And... Scene. Oh, it's just so flattering. An actor of Emmet's caliber can have his pick of actresses to have a fake romance with. Are you sure you're really faking it, not faking faking it? Because it seems like you genuinely like him. No, no, no, no, my fakery is sincere. Well, at least you know Emmet fake-loves you. I have no idea how Alec feels about me. And I can't check my phone because Joy took it. Friends don't let friends text stupid. Oh, you texted him? Just a few times. Eight times! I tried to stop her. No, you didn't. All you said was, [imitating Joy] "Oh, I don't know, Melanie." Anyway, he didn't write back, and I couldn't stand it, so then I texted... "Sorry I texted before. Shouldn't have bothered you on vacay." I was sure he'd acknowledge that. But he didn't, so... "Hi again. "I know I said I shouldn't have texted before, "but could you just text back 'K' so I know you're safe?" - And? - Nothing. So to calm down, I had a little wine. Which brings us to... "Hey, numbnuts, what gives?" Excuse me, Joy, Elka and I need help opening a bottle. May we please borrow your big man hands? Good lord, it's 1,000 degrees in here. [Whispers loudly] Menopause. Oh, would you mind looking over this ad I wrote for Cleveland GILFS? Elka doesn't think it's sexy enough. If this is sexy, I'm Rihanna. There you go making up words again. I know, Joy can read it out loud and then we'll decide. No, not Joy. British voices are not sexy. Oh, really? Well, I'll just get my reading glasses and we'll see who's sexy. If Elka holds the pages far enough away, you won't need glasses. All right. God, it's hot in here. Well, take off your sweater. And I'll point the fan at you. Hi there. Are you looking for some inappropriate fun with some age-appropriate women? [Cell phone chimes] Oh, thank God. - Is that Al... - Dat, dat, dat! Ah, it's from Chloe. Oh, she can't reach Alec either. - She's texted him ten times. - Ten times? Wow. Talk about needy. [Gasps] Oh, and she saw on PerezHilton that Emmet and I are having a steamy, on-set affair. Oh, and apparently we're think about adopting a baby from Malawi. We are such givers. So if you're 5'11" or used to be, enjoy short walks on the beach and back-friendly lovemaking, call Cleveland GILFS. We put the sex in "Sexagenarian." See? Hot. I was wrong. I guess there's no fool like an old fool. Thank you. So did we get the old fool on tape? Let's take a look. [Joy's voice on tape] So if you're 5'11" or used to be... Put it on the website. You realize poor Joy is going to be hit on by every geezer in town. Win-Win. How was school? How old do I look? 35. Same as me. Why? All these old men keep leering and waving at me. And calling me a "tomato." They followed me around the mall like a pack of slow-moving zombies. Luckily, I was able to climb a few stairs and lose them. [Gasps] Oh, my God, this is great. Alec just posted to his Facebook page. "Sorry I'm not returning messages, but I'm on vacation and I left my phone at home." He hasn't seen my texts. He doesn't think I'm an idiot. I hate to bring up the obvious, but he will see them when he gets back. And before you ask, I will not help you break into his apartment so you can delete your messages. That is a great idea! You know, between this and the stair trick, you're kind of a genius. Nice try. But you can't trick Joy Scroggs into doing something stupid with a little flattery. Joy, what are you doing in this ad for something called "Cleveland GILFS"? Oh, dear God! So if you're 5'11" or used to be, enjoy short walks on the beach and back-friendly lovemaking... Elka, Mamie Sue, get out here right now! Well, what do you two have to say for yourselves? I'm so sorry. We never meant for you to find out. You don't have to date anyone. You're just there to get the rubes in the tent. It's a classic bait and switch. We were just saying how smart we were to go with you instead of Victoria or Melanie. - Well, that's nice. - No, it's not. Hello, everyone. Wow! We should have gone with Victoria. What are you doing all dolled up? I have a date. My fake lover is taking me to a real dinner. Emmet Lawson is coming here? Mmhmm. [Doorbell rings] Victoria, you look glorious! And, Melanie, you're a vision. - Oh, and this is Joy. - Hi. Has anyone ever told you you look like Kate Beckinsale? Yes! [Clears throat] Oh, and this is Elka and Mamie Sue. Enchante. Oh, say, "By Odin's sword, I will make the earth tremble with my force." From a little film called Wars of Asgard. Yes. "By Odin's sword, I will make the earth tremble with my force." [Rapid applause] Now say "Love dies..." (Emmet) "...but its echoes never do." From the film A Hymn at Evensong. A favorite. [Applause] Now say, "I don't care who's watching, I want to take you right now." What film is that from? I don't recall it. Just say it. Okay, I think maybe it's time for us to leave. Actually, there's something I need to tell you. [Both cell phones chime] Oh... Oh, another Google alert. What have we done now? [Gasps] We've broken up? I'm so sorry, Victoria. Truly. But my agent said that you weren't testing very well. So now I'm having a fake affair with Heidi Klum... Whom, I'm told, is very nice. She is barely in the movie. Yes, it's a rotten business. But we still have our real friendship. Why couldn't I have dumped you? You know that's not the way it is. I'm a bigger star. [All gasp and groan] Just go. Look, that came out wrong. You're more than fake hurt, aren't you? Get out. As you wish. Good night. Oh, honey, are you okay? [Shaky] No. You do have real feelings for him, don't you? Of course not. I wouldn't make the rookie mistake of falling for my co-star, no matter how handsome and charming and right he is for me in hundreds of ways. I'm just angry because he cares so little for me that he can just switch fake relationships without any regard for my feelings. If it's any consolation, Heidi Klum's not going to stay with him. Why do you say that? She was married to Seal. And... how to put this? Once you've had carnal relations with a gentleman of African descent... It's quite unusual to go back. Hurry up before Alec's neighbors see us. Don't worry, I got this. Where did you learn to pick a lock? A Lifetime Original movie, Don't Go Breaking Into My Heart. [Cell phone chimes] Oh, Victoria, you got a Google alert. What's it say? Nothing. It's about Emmet, isn't it? Just read it. Okay. "Emmet Lawson linked with Heidi Klum, tells Victoria chase 'You're out.'" Oh. I'm sorry, sweetie. Yeah, well, he's the one who's gonna be sorry. Emmet and I are doing our behind-the-scenes interview for the DVD tomorrow, and I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to stay civil. Spoiler alert, I'm not. And presto. I don't understand. It worked every working with her? The truth? James. He protects her from everybody. Even McNamara. Ah, speak of the devil. I was, uh, just telling Tony here how everybody hates you- except for me, of course. Tom was James' best man. He introduced us. He's McNamara's general counsel. You'll have to excuse me. Our Undersecretary for Mass Transit insists on bugging me about the tab for today. So what was the tab for all this? All in? About $80 billion. How much of this came out of my taxes? About $62 billion. Even I want to kill you just a little bit right now. Well, it sounds like she's got enemies. Line forms the left. If there aren't at least ten people on this train that want her dead, I'd be amazed. Listen, see if you can pull the call logs on this phone. You know what, just out of curiosity, does she know you're on her phone? No. I swiped it. I want to see if she's talking to anybody interesting. I want to go 12 rounds with her on it. And another thing, see if you can find Guerrero. Let's bring him in on this. Oh, yeah, sure. Why not? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute now. You're not serious, are you? No one handles this corporate crap like he does. Do you really think you can trust that animal? Sure. As long as we pay him on time. Oh, get a load of this. I'm watching a guy who won't stop shifting his coat. She thinks I'm flirting with her. Anyway, see if you can pull the call logs. I'll keep trying to figure out how she got herself into this mess. Let me know when you find Guerrero. Oh, yeah. ♪ soldier boy ♪ ♪ oh, my little soldier boy ♪ You the guy who been digging around Soucha's Bank, asking questions, making trouble? And you're employees of the bank? You could say that. Well, I'm-I'm sorry, but your employer's involved with some pretty shady loans with this director's families. And my friends need to know just how shady if they're gonna make their case. So... afraid we're at an impasse. We're at a what? Impasse. It means we disagree without prospect of resolution. You know, we came here to explain it to you, but you don't seem to be getting it. Maybe the three of us can take a little walk out back to the alley. We can explain it a little better so there's no impasse.  I got to warn you guys, if this gets violent, I'm gonna fight back. You think you're gonna fight back? All right, maybe fight back's a little misleading. I'll take the beating 'cause that's all you two amateurs are cleared to do. And then one night soon, I'm gonna break into your houses and kill each of you in your sleep. Probably start with you, Alfredo. That way Steven here can have a few extra days with Marla and the girls. It's only fair. How do you know my name? Your employer keeps sensitive information on a drive he thinks is secure. It isn't. Shall we? This is Guerrero. Funny, my phone has the same ring. Yeah, go ahead. Guerrero is in. But listen, I went through her call logs. I found something here that could be pretty interesting. It's strange, don't you think, that we both have the same... Wait a second. That is my phone. Okay. Let me know what you find. You stole my phone. Do you know a times reporter named Mark Hoffer? He covers the project. He'd call me for a background or a quote. Why? Well, his name's not in your contact list, but his number shows up as incoming at least a dozen times, mostly unreturned. Well, I'm bad at returning calls. I haven't spoken to him in almost a year. What difference does it make? Hello? We've never met, but I think you know who I am. My name's Bill Arnold. I think you know what I've been saying about you in Sacramento. But now that I see what you've created, now that it's real, I think the first thing I need to say to you is I'm sorry. Evidently, you were worthy every penny. 'scuse me. We were having a conversation. Wait a minute. Just sit down. Keep your mouth shut. What's going on? The ice in your glass, it's cubed and no one else's are. Oh, my gosh. What happened? We need a doctor! Is there a doctor here? We need a doctor. Well, I rigged the door downstairs. that ought to give us a little bit of warning in case somebody comes looking for you. This was the plan. Flush him out. Get him to commit. Look at me. You trust me? So what do we do now? Well, he's irritated he's got to come to us. We let him make that mistake. Whoa! Son of a bitch. Hey. I need some information on a guy that works in your office. And you couldn't use a phone? Where's the fun in that? It's been a rough day. Let's just cut to the chase. Who's the guy? Mark Hoffer. Sacramento desk. Is that supposed to be a joke? Was it funny? You saying you don't know? Yeah. When? No such thing as a coincidence. Okay, keep digging. Mark Hoffer was killed this morning. With a car bomb. Same explosive as the one used in your car. Oh, my God. There has to be some sort of connection here. Now what is it? Uh, uh, about a year ago, he wrote a piece exposing corner cutting within the project. Hoffer got this information from an anonymous source within the company. Any Chance that anonymous source is sitting at the table with me right now? The cost cutting was jeopardizing safety measures. I kept telling them that a train this big and this fast had to be flawless, but they stopped listening to me. I had to do something. After that, McNamara got scared. He gave me everything I wanted. What else aren't you telling me? Nothing. Well, I don't buy it. People who get themselves in your kind of trouble are usually holding something back. Either it's pride, or they're embarrassed, or they're just stupid, so which one are you? You telling me I deserve this? Nobody deserves this. I'm just saying people have secrets. Secrets are dangerous. So what are you keeping from me? Do you hear that? Hear what? The brakes. They're squealing. So? This isn't a trolley car. If the brakes are squealing, something's wrong. So much for the flawless train. It is flawless. Get down. Tom. Let him go. Let him go. What the hell is going on back here? It's all right. It's all right? Bill's up there hanging on by a thread. It's a coin toss whether he makes it to L.A. alive. And then this guy drags you back here. He didn't drag me back here. W- wait a minute. It's complicated, but I'm okay. Then why did you pull all those emergency brake handles in the last car? What are you talking about? Tom, just go back downstairs. If anybody asks if you saw Stephanie, you say no. Stephanie, I'm your friend. You can trust me. Go. Hey, dude. Breaking and entering is a crime, you know. Yeah, it's good to see you too, Winston. It's been awhile. Oh, not long enough. What are you doing in my office? And what the hell are you doing on my computer? I'm checking out the contents of Mark Hoffer's hard drive. There's not much here. It's mostly personal. Do I want to know how you came about it? Editor at the paper owes me. Couple years ago, a gas company hired a guy to hassle him over a story he's working. Got nasty. I got him out of it. How? I decided to stop hassling him. Listen, you, don't get comfortable here. Because as soon as this case is done, you're gone. Spent too much of your life in an office, Winston. Look at you. It's made you weak. Yeah. No surprise, but I think McNamara management might be involved in this. That's good news. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. All right, cool. I'll, uh, I'll go pay him a visit. Well, how is that good news? Companies like this aren't built to off people, Winston. Tends to get sloppy. Someone talks, the wrong guys listen, and suddenly word's all over the street. Wait, who are you going to see? The wrong guy. Hate him. if Tom was right about these emergency brake handles, we might have a problem. The killer thinks you identified him, right? He's afraid he's caught so he wants to get off the train. He pulls one emergency brake. It doesn't work, so then he pulls them all. Well, that's what we want. He's panicking. He's getting that much closer to making a mistake. He already did. I think he blew out our brakes. Come again? The emergency brake system is complicated. Physical brakes combined with a magnetic system that's controlled by the computer. Problem is, the emergency brakes in the unfinished cars aren't tied into the computer yet. So when our guy kept engaging the disks, it must've overwhelmed the safety. So what are you saying? It's like going 100 miles an hour on the freeway with your foot on the gas and the emergency brake on. If we engage them again, they're gonna explode. I'm sorry, did you say explode? Yeah. It gets worse. There's a curve in the R-2 tunnel about 70 miles ahead. We need the brakes to slow down or we'll derail. If we do hit the brakes, and they blow up, they're gonna take the wheels with them and then we'll derail. 70 miles, that's, like, 20 minutes. Less. We need to warn everyone up front or a lot of people are going to die. Get ready to move. We should call up front, let them know what's going on. How did you-? Where's your phone? A vest? You wore a vest? Where's my vest? I'm your vest. Where's your phone? Back there. What about the intercom? Don't tell me. It's not hooked up yet. How you doing? Haven't seen you around for a while. Haven't been looking for you. Answer for everything. That's why I stopped finding work for you. You didn't know if you've heard of any work put on the street by a company called McNamara Engineering? Not to the best of our recollection. You sure? Hang on. I'll check again. Yeah. I'm sure. What do you care for anyway? You want to know if there's open work, but you don't want to take it. What, are you window-shopping? I see. You've gone over to the other side. You're fighting the good fight, making the world safe for democracy like your friend Chance. Word of advice, Give it up. Maybe it works for him, but not for somebody like you. Just making life hard on yourself, my friend. Companies have secrets. Husbands hate wives. Brothers envy brothers. What'd you just say? You want me to write it down for you? No. I got it. That's the- shh! What's the matter with you? If he hears us, we're gonna be dodging bullets. That's the grate to the next car. You can just unscrew it. We're running out of time. Hurry. Hi. Excuse me. In less than ten minutes, there's a very good Chance that this train is going to crash. I suggest that we get off it. I told you. I'm the interpreter. We need to get off this train. Off the train? You sound like a crazy person. What are you talking about? In a few minutes, we're gonna engage the brakes to take the R-2 tunnel curve. The problem is the disks are overheated. Once we engage them, the disks are gonna explode right out of their housing. This train is gonna go into the tunnel and it's not gonna come out. All right, uh, let's everyone take a breath here. This train is perfectly safe. Its brakes are perfectly safe. Damn it. Listen to me! Stephanie, we're only 18 miles out. Brakes engaged a few minutes ago. Now look, you disappear, you come back here, you're making a scene, you're getting everybody upset. Shh. Shh. Shut down the brakes. Shut them down now. There's a name for the kind of train this just turned into. How did this happen? It's a long story. I'll explain after we get everybody off the train. We're going 220 miles per hour. No one is gonna get off of this train. Run brake assist. There's a supplemental braking system in the rear car. It's too weak to slow the entire train at this speed. But if we separate the car, we can slow it down before it hits the curve. Okay. Okay. Let's get moving. Everyone to the back of the train. What the hell happened back there? He eliminated the threat. Did you recognize him? There's not much left of him. But there's enough to start digging into who hired him. Well, look who found the front door. Still got the call logs from the client's cell phone. Yeah. Good. Read me back the incoming calls from Mark Hoffer. I don't work for you. The dates and times, please. Um, August 20, 53 pm. April 24, 7:31 pm. February 25- What is this? Get Chance on the phone. The system isn't online. We'll have to cut the hydraulics manually. Is there time? We're fine. Once I disconnect the hoses, cars won't separate until the rear car hits its brakes. Why don't you let somebody else do that? I know the guts of this thing better than anyone. It's okay. I'll be okay. Go. Go. I'm sorry. For what? All this. I figure somebody should say it. Well, at least I know what I'll be doing Monday morning. What's that? Building the damn thing all over again. Is everyone onboard? Is everybody here? Yeah. Everyone's here. Hit the brakes. Down to the last connection here. Ready? I thought you said these don't lock. They don't. No. No. How much time? About two minutes to the tunnel. Maybe we could strap ourselves in. Hope the cars hold together. Will they? We're gonna die, aren't we? At this speed, the wake turbulence passing off the tail of the train, it's gonna run just north of level, right? Excuse me. The wake, the turbulence, the wind coming off the back. Yeah. There'd be a bit of an updraft. About 160, 170 degrees? Roughly. How did you know that? Lucky guess. Cut two of those seatbelts as close to the seat as you can. Wait a minute. No, no, no, no. What are you afraid of? Dying. It's not gonna happen. Come on. This'll be fun. This isn't gonna work. I'm open to suggestions. Here. Put this on. Exhale. Hard. Can't believe it's over. It's not exactly over. Be kind of nice to find out who's behind all this, don't you think? Well, at least it's over for a little bit, right? We'd like to thank you for everything. But I think after all this, it might be nice to go home, be alone tonight, just the two of us. Okay. Thank you. Hello. I just finished looking at the expense reports of a reporter by the name of Mark Hoffer. Who is this? They include a number of expenses at a hotel in Laguna. These stays coincided with phone calls placed by him to Stephanie's cell phone. When did you find out your wife was sleeping with Mark Hoffer? Forgot your tie. See, I had a hunch it wasn't the assassin who tried to stop the train and escape. It just didn't fit. It was you, wasn't it? And once your guy missed with the ice cubes, you figured things might be getting a little bit out of control. You're afraid that if I caught him, he'd finger you, and everybody on the train would know that you hired him to try to kill your wife. It was you? Because of me and Mark? It was over. It'd been over for a year. I hadn't even talked to him. I know. Then why now? We-we were better This whole last year, we've been better. It's the money. If he'd done this last year, You don't finish the train- no bonus. This way, he gets the money. You were wrong. Maybe I did deserve what was coming to me. I'm responsible for this. You risked your life for me and I lied to you about who I was. Everybody does that. I don't care what anybody says. Sometimes it's a lot easier. You did something you regret. We're hardwired to do things we regret. It ain't gonna change. There's nothing to be afraid of. And it's certainly not a reason to die. I don't even know what I owe you. Can you at least tell me your name? Christopher Chance. Is that true? And don't you dare count it. See ya, Chance. Well, I told him his services were no longer needed. Why is that funny? Oh, he'll be back. Oh. Hey, listen, um... what do you say you take some time off now. What are you worried about? What's so different about now than anything else I've ever done? And don't get started about how you think I'm losing it because you sound like an idiot. Well, fine. I did think that at first, that you were loosing focus. I haven't lost focus. No, I-I believe you. I do. And now I'm really worried. I ask myself "why would he just continue to do this- "just put himself in situations where he ends up in front of "one loaded gun after another? "what is it? Is it the rush or some kind of weird penance?" And then it hit me. Maybe he keeps putting himself in front of that loaded gun because deep down, he hopes that one of these days he'll get what he really deserves and the gun will finally go off. Go ahead. Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me you're planning on being around for awhile. What the hell are they doing? I don't know. Open up that bag right there. Whiskey? It's not whiskey. Really? 'cause it looks like a bottle of Japanese whiskey to me. I hired you to protect me from those people. And your plan is to have a smoke and a drink? You know, there was a day I would've felt bad opening up a bottle like this. But I'm learning to live in the now. I mean, it might taste better in ten years, it might be worth more. But what if I'm not around to find out? What the hell are you doing? Ah. You're really missing something here. Smooth. Good finish. You'd never even know this stuff burns like jet fuel. Man, you crazy? Let's find out. Sync, corrected by elderman - for addic7ed. com - Good day, Mr. Finley. Good day, Ms. Miller. Well... Rooster! You out, boy? Got him, Mr. Finley. - Morning, Mrs. Baker. - Morning. Hello, Mr. Perryfield. I am sorry I'm a little late. It's about time. I was about to go inside. There's a storm coming, and my hip's killing me. I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Now, you don't think I'm gonna sit around all day waiting for you when the cold comes, do you? No, sir. Be careful with that top step there. It gives a little. Here goes. Uhh. Ah. Yuck! Blech! And good morning to you! Good morning, Mr. Finley! Good morning, Sheila. Beautiful day, isn't it? - Sure is. - How's Jimmy? - He's doing real good. - Good. You take care now, huh? All right. You, too. Les? About this Brady McDaniels, he's already missed several days this month. I can't keep covering. Hey, Mr. Mullins, go look up the word "fragile". Uh, "Les"? When did I become "Les"? Sorry, uh, Lester... Mr. Stevens. Boss, the guy's a screw-up. It's like he's asking to get canned. How many days this month? Hey, Cathy. Congratulations, girl. Thanks, Mr. S. - Four. - Four? That's not so bad. It's only the 12th. Look, Carl... I just think there's something there worth saving. I thought you were gone already. I need someone good, Lester. This has been my route for ten years. I've been voted Best Postal Carrier seven years and counting. I know, Walter, but it's slim pickings right now. What about that new kid Trevor? Oh, he's slow as mud through a straw. - Kay. - Kay's got a month left on maternity leave. And before you ask, Pete just got his knee scoped. Look, Walter, it's your time now. You've always wanted an extended leave. You've earned it. Go, enjoy. I'll find the right fit. Promise. Okay. But there are a few things you should know. 237, the old man... Cornelius Perryfield... checks the box every day at the same time. Good-bye, Walter. It's one trip out, and if the mail's not there, he'll call and complain. And the Bakers' dog, 231, he'll take a chunk out of you if you don't... Go now. All right. One more thing. Oh, Lord have mercy. Take a look at these. 244 Laurel Lane. Can't just shred 'em, but they keep coming. It's like... finding a kitten on your back porch. You can't just walk away. I'll take care of them, Walter. Go on home. I'm staying in town, so call me if you need anything. Get a life, Finley! No. Get a wife. Oh. Ah! Ooh! No, no, no, no. Ah-huh. Ohh, no. No, no, no. Oh, another gourmet dish? Yeah, something like that, Mom. Ohh. Ohh. Honey, nobody expects you to be Supermom. Yeah, well, lucky for that. Gosh, I just wanted to make a nice meal for my kids before I went back to work, and I... Sweetheart, you've got enough on your plate. - Here, let me have these. Come on. - Ohh. Mom, listen, I really appreciate you dropping everything to come here, but it's not fair to put it all on you. I... Yeah, my schedule was so busy! Tea with the Queen and all. Honey, that's what moms are for. Maddy, you need this job. I'll tell you when it gets to be too much. Hot! Hot, Mom! That's hot! I'm sorry! Sorry, sorry. Ah! I gotta go. Thank you! I love you! Right back at you. Honey, was that meatloaf? I'm busy. Come back later. Busy, huh? Have you finished your homework? It's not due till Friday. What's your excuse gonna be on Thursday? I don't know. I'll think of something. Nobody likes a smart aleck, Ben. And your room is a wreck. Clean it, please. Oh, and stay home while I'm gone so Granna doesn't have to worry. Sure thing, Mom. Like I'm gonna ride my bicycle around town and just tear it up. Bed before 11:00. Help Granna and check in on your brother, all right? Okay. Good. Aw, dude, he lost it. Okay, Jimmy's got it. Jimmy's got it. Oh, man, he lost it to them. Okay, he's stolen it back. Yes! Yes! Hey, Tybo. Wait, wait. I'm just about to... and score! Okay. Sometimes I think that gorgeous smile of yours is about the only thing that keeps me going. You tired? A little. - Stomach? - Good to go. - That's my boy. How about your... - Mom. I'm good. Okay, okay. I gotta go. Mwah. Listen, you can call me any time. You know. - Yeah, I know. - Granna will help with the meds, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Uhh! Do you even know how much I love you? I love you... this much. - That isn't very much. - Oh, but it is. Because my love for you starts here and goes all the way around the world, and it ends up right back here. Ohh! Whoa? What's this? That's how much I love you. Mmm! Anyway... Granna's doing something for dinner. I sort of... messed it up. Really? You? Yeah. Stop it. I'm not that hungry anyways. Oh, sweetie. Please try to eat something. Okay. I just don't like to get sick when you're not home. I know. I gotta go. Mwah. I love you. I'll see you in the morning. - I'll be here. - Okay. Computers. That's the third time I've had to reboot this thing. Heh-heh. Mm-hm. Hello, gals. Well, looky here! Finally! - Hey, girl. - Hi. Glad to have you back. Sure is an improvement over some folk. That's funny. Just what I was thinking. Well, I can see things haven't changed around here. How's Tyler? He's good. Yeah. You know, as good as a little boy can be after having brain surgery and 30 treatments of radiation. But he's home. For now. So... So, what does the doctor say? The same. "Medulloblastoma is a rare and aggressive brain cancer. "Don't get your hopes up." Yeah, like I can control that. But you know what? The good news is, my mom is staying for a while until things settle down. - Oh, that's great. - Yeah. Can you give me a report on my patients, please? Yeah, let me... Okay, so, Mrs. Riley is in 406. That little boy Matthew is in 402. And Mr. Samuels is back again in 410. Great. - Uh, Granna? - Mm-hm? You sure you're okay with doing this? Oh, piece of cake. Your mom taught me how to do it. Um, are you sure you know how to do this, Granna? Cool it. You're making me nervous. Tyler! Mom's on the phone! He's up here and he's busy! Now slow. Make sure you don't get an air bubble in my heart. Yes, sir. - Tyler? What's wrong? - Tyler, Mom wants to talk to you. - Aaaaah! - Tyler! - Oh! - Tyler! Aah! Tyler! - Aaaah! - Tyler! Oh, for heaven's sake! That's really not funny. You're a jerk, man. Ben! - I'm sorry, Granna. - Silly. - Mom! - Maddy? Mom, is Tyler okay? Everything's fine. Everything's okay. - You don't have to come home. - Mom, everything's fine here. Just stay at work. Right. Oh, fool me once. Oh, Maddy, I've got to call you back. Okay. Call me back. Hey. Is he okay? Yeah, he's okay. Are you okay? No. This whole thing stinks. Well, I get that. When I'm struggling with something, it really helps me to pray about it. Pray? Yeah. What are we supposed to pray for, exactly? Dear God... don't take Tyler. You have Dad. Isn't that enough? Oh, Ben. Prayer is just telling God what's in your heart and asking Him to help you with it. Well, maybe I don't want to tell God what's in my heart. I'm afraid to ask God to help Tyler. I mean, what if He doesn't? No, I can't. Come on. Come on. Dear Heavenly Father... "Dear God... "how many people are in heaven? "Must be a lot. "I know two, and I'm only eight." We are struggling, Lord. We're scared, and we need your guidance. "I learned a new word today. "Medu... lloblastoma... or something. "My mom says I'll be sick for a while, "but it'll be okay." "Why am I sick, God? "The medicine stinks. "But I don't have to take my spelling test this week, "so that's good." "Can you see the stars from heaven? "My dad said You made them all. "I'm really glad to be home from the hospital. "But most of all, "I really just wish my mom would laugh. "I miss that the most." In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Do I have to fill out a form or something? Spoken like a true government worker. Yeah. So, you're having trouble quieting those demons tonight? You having trouble remembering you're just the bartender? McDaniels, if you keep pushing people away... Save it. You're not my C.O. Anymore.

Yeah but I missed you guys. Aw that's sweet. But we're kind of busy right now. Your turn dear. What's the use? 22 cards in my hand and I still can't play! Can't this wait? Of course it can. What's up? Well um... I have something important to discuss with you and I thought if you really listen to me you might understand. Bob. What? I'm listening. We're listening. Even if it sounds crazy? I listen to your father all the time. What's that supposed to mean? Go on sweetheart. When I woke up this morning I was 16 years old. I thought this was going to be the best day of my life. Then this Birthday Fairy appeared and gave me these. Would you look at this hon. Well that brings back memories doesn't it? What? What memories? Your father took me to the Lucky Duck Chinese Restaurant on the night you were born. I had the orange chicken. We thought it was an omen. We always felt so lucky to have a daughter as wonderful as you are. Really? Really. Then you'll understand when I say I need to come back and live with you and go back to school.. I'm not ready to have my own apartment and my own job. Please tell me you understand. Abby look behind you. Ever since you were a little girl all you wanted was to be exactly what you are now. Beautiful and independent. I remember the day this photo was taken. You wanted a grown-up birthday party. All dressed up in my high heels and pearls. You were never happier. But being grown up is different than dreaming about it isn't it? Yes. We understand you. You do? Of course. You're scared your childhood is over and with it all the best times of your life. Yes! You probably want to just turn back the clock and start over. Yes! Yes! That's exactly what I want to do! We know how that feels. Then I'm still your little girl? You'll always be our little girl Pumpkin... Look! Wasps! Time to go Pumpkin. Drive safe. And don't forget these. But I thought you guys understood. We do understand Adulthood could be tough. Sometimes it gets a little buggy. Bye now sweetheart! Love you! So that's what that feels like. Hi Logan. Hey. Cool ride. Yeah you said that this morning. Huh? So...what are you doing here? Party. Right. I wasn't invited. Huh. Hey! Yeah? Will you do something for me? Sure. Take a picture of me with your car. Okay. Thanks. It's what I want when I'm your age. There ya go. Cool. Oh man that's hot. I can't wait to show Krista! Joey Lockhart! Get off of me! Get off! You have to believe me Jay. You're my best friend and it's my 16th birthday and I got these magic candles at the bus stop and this big car pulled up and Joey Lockhart got out and kissed me... I don't know her. You were there! You saw him! Let go. Not until you listen to me. Give me five minutes. Four. Okay. I know this is hard to believe but we're best friends and I can prove it. So? Look at your key ring. "Happy Sweet 16. Love Jay." You gave this to me this morning. For my 16th birthday. Abby. You remember? I think so. So you believe me? Yeah. I do. He believes me! Whoa. Volume. This doesn't change anything. And when midnight comes I'm stuck like this forever. Here lemme see the list. Here ya go. Okay you've used 1 2 7 8 9... Skip ahead. I can't believe you wasted a wish on sushi. I was 8. I had a very unsophisticated palate. Had? You're a great best friend Jay. I know. C'mon. Most of these are kind of useless since you're already an adult. That leaves 15 and Logan Buchanan... Yeah about that... 15 was always my favorite. "When I'm 16 I'll have the best party ever." But you're not 16 anymore. Hey. I kinda have to make an appearance at Krista's party. Do you maybe want to come with me? Not as my date or anything. No. Of course not. Well? I'd love to go with you Jay. Okay. Great party. Ladies first. Mike? Give a shout-out to my big sis Abby everybody. You're super old Abs but you're still cool! So Mike can really play? Yeah. Something just clicked with him this year. He got serious about playing guitar. He's getting paid really well for this gig. Wait. Did I miss something? I mean besides senior year? Jay you're here! Hi! I'm so glad you could make it! Yeah. I'm... Abby Jensen. I know silly. We're neighbors? Yes. Neighbors. Your party looks awesome. Thanks to your parents. They found all these amazing decorations in their garage after their house was infested by wasps. I guess they were left over from your Sweet 16 Party but never got used for some reason. So they just gave them to me! Lucky you. I know right? And you're just in time for the big celebration. Thanks for coming everybody! Man this is a dream come true for me. What's happening? Jay Kepler ladies and gentlemen. Our new Student Body President! Thank you. I want to recognize my campaign manager Krista Cook. What all of you don't know is that I really wanted this but I was too afraid to try. I couldn't have done it without your help Krista. Thank you so much! 1 2 3 4... Have fun okay? Mm-hmm. So you're Student Body President? Yep. I was Student Body President. Oh yeah. Weird. I thought with me out of the way Krista would win for sure. Krista? She's hates competition. Krista? Our Krista. Yeah. I think without you in her life she just didn't have a reason to compete for anything. She's kind super helpful a good listener and a great friend. You guys would like each other.

This day didn't go like I thought it would. I can't believe I wasted my wishes on things like beating Krista Cook. Yeah. She's pretty nice now that she is not out to destroy you. Don't rub it in. She's a really good friend to Jay. Better than I was. I didn't even know he wanted to be Student Body President. How could I have been so thoughtless? All I could think about was having parties and clothes and popularity. I can't believe those things were so important to me. You were 16. But I didn't appreciate it. Ever since I was little I wanted to grow up. I thought it was the only way to get what I wanted. I guess I didn't realize what I already had. You still have this little number. Wish 16. All those years I saved it for something really special. Of all the wishes on this list this is the one I wish I could change. Wow that gum is still really fresh. Maybe the rules don't know about gum. There's only one way to find out. I wish I could start this whole day over again. Surprise! Happy Birthday Abby. Look. Your first 16th birthday picture. This is a great picture! This is the best picture I've ever seen in my entire life! Thank you thank you thank you! You're welcome Pumpkin. Make a wish sweetheart? I wish for exactly this. Everything is perfect. Wasps! Yeah. I saw one crawl up the AC vent. No not one. Thousands! Nesting up there for 16 years! Sweetheart we know. No you don't know. You can't possibly know that the house is going to be totally infested and the wasps will take over the cars and you and Dad'll have to live in the driveway but then Joey Lockhart will come and kiss me and I will get candles and wishes and some really gorgeous clothes and everything will look like it will be okay. But then I will make a really stupid wish that I didn't mean to make and I will have to grow up and live alone and miss my party and this will turn into the worst 16th birthday in the history of 16th birthdays! You have to call the exterminator now! Okey dokey. All done. Whoo that was some wasps' nest. Celeste? Hi Abby. You know her. Yeah we just met this morning. When Abby called me. You're very lucky I showed up when I did. So the wasps are all gone. Like they never happened. Everything is going to be okay? Better than okay. Wait. What do I owe ya? Consider it a Sweet 16 gift. Happy Birthday Abby. Thank you. For everything. Go on down and start making that special birthday breakfast you have planned for me Mom. I'll be right there. ♪ Da na na da na na now! ♪ ♪ Da na na da na na now! ♪ Hey! This is for you. I was saving it for my Sweet 16 party but I think you need it more. Whoa! For what? A real guitar. I think you're really talented. Thank you Abs. I love you Mike. Thanks for the yummy breakfast Mom and Dad. Love you! Love you too. Krista! Krista! Wait! Get back. We need to talk. I have nothing to say to you. I have one quick question. No you cannot have a ride. I don't want a ride. I want to understand. What did I ever do to you? Go away. No. Not until you answer me. Why don't you like me? You really don't know do you? Not a clue. It was in third grade. Jay and I were best friends. Then you moved to town. It was my birthday. Jay and I made a pact... Cheese! Best friends forever! Yeah! I stole your best friend. On my birthday. After that Jay and I did everything together. Without me. That must have been so horrible for you. It was. I can't imagine how you felt. How I felt? I felt like a loser. Krista if I could turn back the clock and change that day I would. I am so sorry. You are? Any chance you can forgive me? I don't know. I made my own vow that day. Which was... I vowed to win at everything so you'd never get anything you wanted ever again. Wow. You did a great job. Thank you. Hey imagine if you used your powers for good instead of evil. Like what? Do you really want to be Student Body President? Honestly? No. It's exhausting having to win all the time. If you want to drop out I know somebody who would love to take your place. Hey Krista. Hey Abby! Boys. Cool ride! Thanks! Weird. You're a terrible best friend. No I'm not. Yes you are. I had to take the bus by myself. Where were you? I got a ride. You two. In one vehicle. And it didn't like explode? Nope. We have a surprise for you. Why? It's not my birthday. No it's mine... And mine... And all we want is for your dream to come true. What dream? You're now the only person running for Student Body President. So you'll win for sure. Think so? Absolutely. Jay Kepler ladies and gentlemen. Our new... Student Body President! Go Jay! Thanks everybody. Let's hear it for the hosts of this little party Abby and Krista! Happy Sweet 16 to the both of you Look who's here. Huh? Look! Logan Buchanan he's so gorgeous! You really like him don't you? Yeah. I thought you liked him to make me suffer. Making you suffer was a bonus but I would have liked him anyway. Well I happen to know he really likes you too. Really? Really. Go talk to him. About what? Ask him about the red sports car he wants to drive someday. Okay. Hi Logan. Thanks a lot for coming. You look great. You too. Happy Birthday Abby. Yes it is.

I'm struck by the number of people who are struggling in this world. And as much as that saddens me, I'm also humbled by their strength and the courage they display in the face of their struggles. Crisis Intervention, how can I help? WOMAN [OVER PHONE]: Hi, is this Haley? Uh, yes, it is, hi. It's good to hear your voice, how are you? I've been better, that's for sure. In high school my parents lost their fortune and it was difficult. I remember feeling so helpless and thinking I wanna build something. Own something, so this never happens to me. And here I am. Where is here? My company, Clothes Over Bro's, declared bankruptcy. Which would have allowed me to keep the company but our investors would lose all of their money. So I've decided to pay them back. Every penny. But to do that I have to sell the company and deplete my personal fortune, as well. You're going to give away your money so that they don't lose theirs? Mm-hm. And you have no obligation to do this? No. Then why do it? Because it's the right thing to do. I've been asking people this question. It's sort of the point of this documentary. It's a simple question that I'd like to ask you. What comes next? I don't know. For me I get to go and visit my mother in prison and tell her that I sold my company. Good times. Did you do it yet? No, I told you I'd wait, and I waited. Sweet, it's gonna be so gross. It's gonna be totally gross. Come on, chop-chop. You know, on second thought, I think I'm just gonna leave it. Oh, no. The doctor said that you have to change the bandages every other day, and it's been three days. Clay's coming home today. It can be something him and I do together. Like a bonding thing. Some couples go bowling, we'll change each other's gunshot wounds. And besides, it feels kind of oozy. - Awesome, let's see it. - Quinn, I am a mother. And I volunteer at a crisis center. This is a piece of cake for me, let's go. Okay. It's not that bad, right? - I'm gonna throw up. - Passing out here. Haley. Mouth McFadden. Spending a little time in the past? Yeah, I still come out here to think, you know? I miss it. How about you? One last look before camp? No. I just came out here to think too. Anything I can help with? Better be careful, Mouth. Last time you helped me you got fired. Now you're sitting out here at the Rivercourt, looking creepy and stalker-ish. Ha-ha-ha. This is true. You're on your own this time. Sometimes I wonder if I had to do it all over again, if I would. Yeah. Well, I don't know if I ever told you this but I respected you so much for refusing to report that story. And I know a lot of other people did too. Thanks. I just wish one of them owned a TV station and could hire me. How's that going? Eh, not so good. I have a website where I do this sports podcast but the only hits I get are from Millie pretending she's not Millie. Well, for what it's worth, I think the answer is yes. If you had to do it again you'd do it just like you did the first time. Because that's who you are. And that's a guy we all like and respect. [SIGHS] I just wish I was doing better. NATHAN: How are you doing without your computer Mr. Technologically-Grounded? Fine. Bored. Did you tell Clay yet? Why do you ask? At the risk of losing my PlayStation, you avoid things, Dad. It's what you do. I do not, you dork, now, come over here. Clay is healing right now, he's recuperating so I have to be respectful of that. - So you didn't tell him yet. - No. You guys crack me up sometimes. You and Mom and Aunt Quinn. You worry about stuff that doesn't really matter. Well, you're short. Yeah, but I'm fast and your back is messed up. You make a good point. Okay, I'll talk to Clay. I wish you were a Bobcat, Dad. And I know you do too. And I figure if you're not playing, you must really think it's for the best. And if I can understand that, Clay will too. "Closed over Bro's." Closed over Bro's? What is wrong with you? - Mom... - I am rotting in a prison. Prison. And you give away my company? Oh. Our company? It's unforgivable. It was the right thing to do. Screw the right thing to do. I'm in prison. Those people believed in me, Mom. I believed in you too. Look where that got me. I leave you alone for a few days and you go back to being that stupid girl who follows her heart. I never cared for that version of you. I never will. Don't visit me again. Hey, Nate. Hey, man, what's going on? I came from seeing Clay. I wanted to talk to him about the documentary. The whole "what comes next" theme seems to apply. - Say anything about me retiring? - No, figured you hadn't yet. - Why is that? - Jamie says you avoid things. I'm totally gonna take that kid's PlayStation. Ha-ha-ha. Well, if you do, maybe he could use this. My dad was a lifelong Pirates fan. When I was a kid, he gave me this glove, said it belonged to Roberto Clemente. It must have killed him that I was such a horrible player. I thought Jamie might like it. Are you sure about this? This is probably worth a lot of money. Yeah, but it'll be worth a lot more when Jamie goes pro. Besides, that glove belongs on the hand of someone who loves the game. Me, I used to stand out in right field and chase butterflies. The glove respects what I'm doing here. I'm sure it does. Probably didn't respect that you brought it in a purse. That's a man bag. If that's your story. - Just take the glove. - I'm sure he's gonna love it, thank you. And as far as your documentary goes, you should consider Mouth. Talk about a guy who's starting over. Thanks, I will. - Good luck with Clay. - Thanks. It is a man bag, by the way. Oh, you mean that purse? Well, well. Hey, check this out. [GROANS] Right side entrance wound. Right side exit wound. Right side kidney transplant. - Strong. - Ha, right. I'm done. Word on the street is you get to go home today. Yeah, I think so. Well, I'm here for you, buddy. I know, but you shouldn't be. You gotta get to camp, man, you have a contract. You have a nice new contract. And speaking of which, I, uh... I hope it's not too weird for you. But my former employer is gonna be repping you for a while. ISC, why? Because I got shot. They offered to represent my clients until I was up to it. It's the right thing to do. Aren't you worried about those guys stealing your clients? Yeah, but what am I gonna do? I can't represent anyone right now. I can barely eat applesauce. And anyway, if a client's gonna leave, they'll leave. At least I'll always have you. Unless you don't go to camp. Yeah, listen, Clay. About that, I know how hard you worked for me to be a Bobcat and it'll always mean the world to me. But the doctors say that my back is getting worse. And I've been doing a lot of soul-searching about it. I think it's time for me to stop. I'm sorry, Nate. It's gotta be really hard for you. - Dude, don't say that. - Why not? I've been worried about how much this was gonna hurt you. Me? Why, because of the new contract? Yes, because of the new contract. Nate, you're my best friend. And my best client. But your health comes first. Your family comes first. - How long have you known this for? - About my back? - Pretty much since you got shot. - Ugh. You see, this is what you do, man, you avoid things. - I do not. - Yeah, you do, even Jamie knows it. Yeah, we've established that, thank you. You're a warrior, Nate. Man, I'm proud of you. You're doing the right thing. If I had known there was any concern over your back, I wouldn't let you play this year. Thank you, Clay. Means a lot. Any idea what you're gonna do next? Yeah, I'm gonna help my best friend rehab. Did you see me own that applesauce earlier? - Strong. - Very strong. [CHUCKLES] HALEY: Ugh. I thought you weren't coming. Under the bridge, really? What, we always came here. You and Peyton always came here. I was tutor girl. I wasn't under-the-bridge girl. Been searching every bridge in Tree Hill. The homeless love me by now. Sorry, I turned my phone off. We can talk now, Brooke Davis. Crisis Intervention, how can I help you? So I told my mom I'm selling the company. And she yelled at me. Your mom always yells at you. Not like this. She was really upset. Like, no-going-back upset. If your mom hadn't made the choices she made in the first place she wouldn't be in prison and you wouldn't have to sell your company. This is all her own fault. I know you're right. It's just... After all the success. After all the money the press, the awards, the celebrity... It's just been about getting my mom to love me. To tell me she's proud of me. And that's all it's ever been. Yeah, that's all it ever is. [PHONE RINGING] Mm. I should really start a crisis line for my friends. - It's called your phone number. - Oh, tell me about it. Come on. Mia? Shh! Sorry. What's, uh...? What's going on? Don't look at the bar. - I said don't look at the bar. - Okay. Sorry. Jeez! Look, I need you two to be honest with me. Do you think they're sleeping together yet? You can look at the bar now. No, you're fine. I think they were having sex before he knew her name. We're talking about Alex. That's what I thought. So I made this voodoo doll of her, check it out. Okay, so here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna book you a show somewhere anywhere, and you're gonna get away. - Why? - Because you're going a little crazy. And you, your mother was always a bitch. You should suck it up and have a drink. - You work at a crisis center? - Yes, I do. Well, those people are screwed, kind of like Chase there. I'm sorry, it just... See, crazy. Come on. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Mouth, I wanted to talk to you about... - Sure, come on in. Do you want a, uh, beer or soda? Uh, no, thanks, I'm good. Do you have any beer or soda? No, sorry. Oh, that's okay. Have a seat. I wanted to talk about this documentary... I'd love to, how much does it pay? - Uh, well, nothing right now, I just... - Fine, I'm in, under one condition: We start today. - Well, I got a attempting to conquer Berth, but planet Berth fleet.s Captain Ram fought courageously.

All right. Oka- - No, you go. Go, go. [sighs] Ooh, that's... alright. [Tommy] So, after school, maybe we'll, uh, we'll stop by the art store and get you a new sketchbook? And, um, some of those wh-- wh-- what were those called? Charcoal... somethings? Yeah. Worth a shot. [door closes] You know, I still had eight months. You're amazing. Okay. Just-- I didn't actually do... [clears throat] With all due respect, I wish you'd gotten life. Maybe you'll lose a few pounds, huh? Hey, go change. I'll explain your parole terms. Hey,hey. Come here. [smooches] All right. Be good. [blues music plays] [snorting] Ahh. Seriously, I don't know how you did that, but... thank you. We should celebrate tonight. Well, what's wrong with right now? Come here. - Hey, Tommy! ' Hey, guys. - Hey, Tommy! - What's up, Tommy? No association with known felons. No weapons, and of course, [moans] You can't... vote! [moans] So, when am I gonna see you again? Well, I got to confess, I'm always getting into trouble. And when I do, I know where to find a good lawyer. [sighs] [indistinct conversations] Do you know how hard it is to get pink peonies this time of year? Thanks, Jane. They're my wife's favorite. [door buzzes] - God damn. - Bye, Chef. Take care, buddy.

Hey, I got to be somewhere, pal. - Empty your truck onto the street. - Screw you. I'd appreciate some civility... - and some cooperation. - [garbage man] So sorry, Mr. Woichik.

Uncle, reminding you I need tomorrow night off. - My daughter's talent show. - Consider me reminded, lovely. Hi, Dion. Bye, Dion. Can I stay here tonight? All of my rooms and all my girls are booked. I'm telling you, the Bronx is the next damn Gold Rush. Which is why these lotto machines are working overtime. Son of a bitch. Come on. Get out. [blues music plays] - Going already? - Huh? [chuckles] Patrick. It's not your usual time. I'm looking for your nephew. Dion? Doesn't get out for months. Find him. You know, there's a couple of cops up there, maybe a judge.

Uh, work's-- work's been brutal. I'll call to set something up. Well, we have about 15 minutes till school lets out. Come on. [Tommy] My health insurance only covered ten sessions with a shrink, and ten sessions with a speech therapist, but now-- now it's maxed out, and it's all on me. It's just a lot to juggle without his morn around. I can only imagine. Yeah, you can only imagine. What are you thinking? I'm thinking if you had 20 years more experience, what a difference that would make for T.J. You are totally deflecting. I am who I am. You are who you are. So let's-- let's talk about what's real-- T.J. failing, T.J. getting into fights, T.J. not talking. I get it. You have a lot on your plate as the only parent. T.J.-- So what, now, I'm- - I'm the only single parent whose kid is having trouble in school? No. You're the only single parent whose son witnessed his own mother get killed in a hit-and-run and hasn't said a word since. [bell rings] And whose father has a drinking problem. - I smell alcohol on your breath. - That's wine. - I'm a wine rep. That's part-- - Yeah, Mr. Moran, if this continues to go downhill, I'm required by law to notify Child Protective Services. What does that mean, exactly? You could lose T.J. I'm not gonna let anyone take you away. [door buzzes] In trouble so soon? I miss you already. [scoffs] Hey, uh, can I come in? Ooh. [chuckles] Look, you're a great lay, but I think we should keep this client-attorney business strictly professional. [lock clicks] [horn honks in the distance] Good behavior? [Dion] Oh, I don't know. My money's on, uh, good cooking. [laughs] - [Tommy] Glad to see you. - [Dion] You, too. Are you gonna crash here? Yeah. Yeah, just for one night. Got to go to Paris tomorrow. Yeah, I... I got to get away. That's too bad. It'd be nice to have you around. Yeah, I'll be back. So you were in the one prison without a weight room? [chuckles] Nice. Don't worry, I'll still kick your ass. How you doing, man? You okay? T.J., you remember Dion. Look at you. Huh? What's up, T-Bone? All right. Come on. All right. Oh, you see they turned the methadone clinic into a yoga studio? Yeah. Got an organic market coming in, too. I know. It's crazy, right? It's like I said, you know, the Bronx is the new Brooklyn. Eh, it's coming up, man. Yeah, well, parts of it. Maid called in sick. Look, how do you live like this, huh? I had better things back in prison. Well, I'm sure they'd make room for you again. Hey, uh, is T.J. all right? You know, he seems a little-- - Quiet? - Dented. Dented, I'll take. It's broken I'm worried about. He hasn't spoken since she died. Oh, thanks for coming to the funeral, by the way. [chuckles] Oh, yeah, well, uh, the county jail was all out of hall passes that day. Oh, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, you're killing me. You- - You got a $20,000 stove, and your fridge is empty. Well, there's not a lot of time for grocery shopping. All stocked up on wine, though, I see,huh? How are you and the bottle getting along these days? Really well, actually. Yeah? Yeah, no. We're- - We're in love. How about you and the blow? We broke up. 'Cause it's so hard to get drugs in prison. Yeah. Yeah, thanks for coming to visit me, by the way. I'm sorry. Was I not there for you? That's funny, uh, 'cause the way I remember it, the one time I really needed you, you know, when my wife was killed, you got coked up and burned down the restaurant we worked at. So not only did I lose my wife, I lost my best friend and my job. So no, no, thank you. I'm sorry about Rie. I miss her, too, you know? [footsteps approach] [Dion] Hey, what's up, T-bone? You hungry? [blues music plays] So, put it down like that. [sizzling] Ah, j-- j-- just-- just hold on, champ. What? Go on. Oh, come on, man. Tommy, what are you doing? The food's getting cold. Uh, look, I'm really-- I'm really not having this with you. All right, listen, the kid doesn't eat until you do it. Tonight, we have, uh, our special, house-made malfatti with vine-ripened Roma tomatoes, parmesan, and basil. Pairs perfectly with this 2010 Chianti Classico, an old-world Sangiovese, aged in traditional botti. That's large-format barrels, neutral oak. Look for dried red fruits, a medium body, and a bright, mouthwatering acidity. - And he's back. - [chuckles lightly] Can we eat already? [Sniffs] [trains squealing in the distance] Okay, so I'm a little out of practice cooking Italian. What do you mean? That meal was perfectly mediocre. [chuckles] I still want to do Greek. Yeah, well, it's gonna be hard if you're moving to Paris. Oh, why don't you come to Paris with me? - [chuckles] - [Dion] Seriously. We could do the restaurant there. Great idea. Yeah, T.J.'s old enough to live here on his own. Oh, no, no. T.J.'s already coming. We- - We just wanted to know if you wanted to come. Oh, yeah? [laughs] You're out of your mind. Seriously, though. I mean, think about it. You know, you, me, Tee}... [Dion] Three bachelors letting loose in the city of love. Come on, man, we-- we would have the best Greek restaurant in all of Paris. I can't uproot T.J. like that. He's been through enough change. Seems he needs a fresh start almost as much as you do. It's not that simple. Besides, I- - I- - I can't handle that whole French scene without you. Who's gonna make fun of it with me? Huh? Come on, seriously. [stammers] I won't survive. You always survive. [scoffs] All right. All right, look at that. Tell me, what do you see? - Uh, a plate? - [Dion] No. You see black orzo in a spicy seafood broth and a celeriac puree. [Sniffs] Topped with, uh... grilled octopus and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes, perfectly finished with micro bronzed fennel. [Dion] Mmm! Classic Mediterranean, with a very specific and dare I say, a very personal Hellenic influence. Dude, I helped you come up with this whole menu. You don't have to walk me through it. You know, in prison, all anyone's ever thinking about is escaping. You know what I was thinking about? I was thinking about Thirio. Who do you think you're talking to? Downstairs, all I see are Rie's unfinished designs. That giant espresso machine from Italy, Rie put that together herself. I look up to the ceiling, I see- - I see pine beams-- - Cypress. - The whole-- what? Cypress beams. It's a Mediterranean restaurant. There is no pine in the Mediterranean. Pretty sure it's pine. - Well, where's the Bible? - Forget it. Come on, take a look. [Dion] Wow. It was a long time ago. It was a lifetime ago. Yeah. [Dion] Wow. Uh-oh. Boom. Bite me. Come on, imagine it. Thirio in Paris. With the two of us, man, we could totally pull it off. It was the three of us that were gonna pull it off. I could never do it any other way. First, the Chinks come in. Then the mighty Irish push them out, until the Wops and the Jews take over. And, then, whoops; here come the Coloreds and the Spics and, bam! Now the Vietnamese or Cambodians, whatever the hell they are. So basically, it's Chink to Chink, circle of life. My father, rest his soul, used to say a neighborhood is like an organism, a living thing, always changing, always needing something. And a good businessman finds out what that need is and fills it. No offense to my old man, but what he didn't know, the real money is in filling that need even when it don't need filling. Ah, come on. [grunts] [water fizzes] [Tommy sighs] [sniffs, sighs] [snorting] [exhales heavily] All right, buddy. Hey, I'm taking Teej to school. You can stay until your flight, I guess. Just don't burn the place down. [chuckles] Yeah, well, take care, man. Yep. You too. Hey, thanks. And you... you know, you might want to keep it down a little bit, huh? All right. [sighs] [Sniffs] II [bell dings] [man shouting indistinctly] [Dion] Table 33. All right, let's go. Come on, let's go. [soft piano music plays] [indistinct conversations] Is this the grief group? Yeah. I'm- - I'm Tommy Moran. Welcome. Thanks. It's my first time. It's a little overwhelming. I remember. I'm Pilar Herrera. My husband, Oscar, died in my arms... of a heart attack. You'? My wife, Rie, car accident. I'm sorry. Me too, you. So, urn, what do you do? One day at a time, I guess. I meant for a living. [chuckles] Oh, I'm a sommelier, but I'm between restaurants, so, uh, I rep wines. No way. I'm in the restaurant business, too. My sister has a place, La Cubana Loca, in Harlem. Actually, I'm, like, the manager. We're always looking for wines. We should exchange numbers. I kept looking at the door, thinking Rie was gonna walk in at any second, but she never did. She never will. All right, let's-- we're gonna try a little role-play, okay? I want you to tell your wife what it is you're going through. Gloria, you-- you be his wife, okay? - [sobbing] No. - [therapist] All right, um, uh... Pilar, is it? Pilar? Y- - You, can you do that? Will that be okay? So, Tommy, tell Pilar how you're feeling. [therapist] It's okay. [voice breaking] I miss you... all day long. [Tommy] We were supposed to do this together. Raise our son, start a restaurant. I can't... [Tommy] I need you. We need you. [folk music plays] You're like a phantom limb. I love you. Dion. [siren wailing in the distance] What! [Woichik] Mm. Ah... travel. So good for the soul. [sighs] Maury Finkelberg? Short notice. Not only... do you burn down our restaurant... you get caught. An employee of ours committing arson, so no insurance. My father might be in prison. That doesn't change the fact that you owe us 600 grand. - Look, I'm gonna pay it back. - From Paris? I'm going on a-- was going on a-- on a sourcing trip. My new restaurant needs top-of-the-line equipment. Dion, Dion, Dion. Come and take a look. I'll show you. [tense music plays] Obviously, we're still, uh, you know, in the process of setting up, but, you know, we got... got a Jade freestanding range over here, the Belle Epoque, brass and copper espresso machine we had specially shipped in from Italy. We have a, uh, a walk-in fridge that's gonna go over there. Now, the prep and, uh, cooking stations are-- they're gonna go here, here, there. Yeah, we're, uh, we're looking into... to cypress pillars for the dining room. Plus, uh, we're gonna be growing our own herbs in the greenhouse we're gonna build up on the roof. I mean, we could be up and running within, uh, within two months. Well, you know me and kitchens. When you're not burning them down. Yeah. That never gets old. You were the one who made me executive chef at Ottavio's. The profit we were making there, I can double that. I can pay you back. You could be eating braised lamb with a wild-mushroom ragout while this place becomes a laundromat for your money. People are gonna come. Okay. But you try and skip town again, these two will die. So will your favorite and only uncle. Oh, and that lady lawyer friend of yours. But you, Dion, I'll let you live so you'll always remember what you caused. Look,uh, I'm not going anywhere. Good, 'cause I'll be collecting on your debt every week. [breathes heavily] I hope this restaurant's a success. Be a shame if I went through all the effort of getting you out of prison early just to... kill everyone who means something to you. One more thing Come on! What are you doing? No, no! What are you doing? ! Come on, I can pay you back! - Smile. - I'll pay you back! It will make it so much easier for the both of us. Please, Patrick! [screaming] No! Please, not the teeth, no! [Dion breathing shakily] Maybe we try something different? Oh, God. Oh, God. Say, a little finger? No, no! No! No,no,no,no,no, no,no,no,no! Oh, God, no! [screaming] Oh, God! [groaning] See you soon, Dion. [breathing heavily] [indistinct conversations] [blues music plays] [indistinct conversations] Yo. Yo, yo, Manny. Manny. I need you to do me a solid. Thanks, bro. Shouldn't you be halfway to Paris by now? What is that? What are you doing? [breathing heavily] What happened to your finger? Uh, cab door. Is that why you're not in Paris, 'cause-- 'cause of your boo-boo? No. No. This is why. [blues music plays] [sizzling] All right. G-- go ahead. Hold on. I- - I have to get some A.1. If you don't mind, go ahead. Words would be nice. It's astonishing, maybe even perfect. No, no, no. It's never perfect. Dude, just take the compliment. Go ahead, try. Try some. Come on, try it. [Tommy] It's good, right? [Dion] Now, this... this is gonna be the signature dish of Thirio. Look, I didn't go to Paris 'cause our dream was to open a restaurant right here, man. We are so doing this! You got any homework? All right. Now is a good time. I told you, I'm not doing a restaurant without Rie. If you could see yourself right now, living in this place. I'm the one who's been in prison this last year, and you're the one who's messed up? I mean, y-- you're stuck, man, bad. You drink too much. You work a demeaning job. It's been almost a year since Rie died. And what? Come on, what? You're still wallowing? Right, right! "Get on with it, Tommy!" "Shake it off, Tommy." - "Move on, Tommy," right? - All right, look, I'm not saying-- You have no idea what you're talking about. You don't know what it's like to be in love, to be married, to raise a son with-- with the woman you love. And you have no idea what it's like to lose her. Man, I had to clean out her closet, clean out her bathroom, throw her mouth guard... in the trash. Do not tell me how to grieve, and don't tell me to open a restaurant without her. [Dion] We're not doing it without her. We're doing it with her. She will live through this restaurant. No, she won't. II I love you more than anything in the world. You know that, right? All right. [smooches] Sweet dreams. See you in the morning. [metal clanging] - [Dion screams] - Stay in bed. [grunting] [shouts] Hey! What the hell are you doing? ! Look, if you're not gonna do a restaurant, then you don't deserve this! - Hey, let go. - Give it back. - Let go! - Get your hands off it! - Hey, hey, hey! - You're not worthy of it. You're not worthy! Get off, get off! [clattering] You know what? ! You don't deserve any of this! - Oh. - [plate shatters] Oh, oh! Throwing plates! - No, none of this! You must be Greek. All right, would you stop? ! Hey! Stop! Hey! You want this just as much as I do. You're just too much of a drunk to realize it! [laughs] The coke head speaks. This is so you. I let you crash here, within 24 hours, you're trashing the place. Oh, trashing the place? What, this shit hole? What are you even doing here? ! Just go! [Dion] Oh, I'm so sorry! [Tommy] Get out. Go on! Take your massive ego with you... Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt your downward spiral, - you self-loathing, self-pitying... - you selfish, narcissistic... - shell of your former self! - selfish son of a-- [cellphone ringing] [cellphone continues ringing] He's calling to hear Rie's voice on the outgoing message. Yeah, well, he's not doing so good, T. Tell me about it. Yeah, well, then why do you make him live like this? This place, the way it is, it's like a-- like a tomb of Rie's dream that can never come true. The way I see it, you either burn it down or you build it up! - Oh, man, y-- you got to stop. - No, I don't. Look, when we were doing the restaurant, when we were coming up with plans for Thirio, you were so amped, man. You were so alive. Yeah, I also had a wife. This isn't about you! Wake up! This is about your son! Look, if we do this restaurant and you get that fire back in your belly, you have a purpose again. And you know how quickly T.J.'s gonna turn around. He lost his mom. He doesn't need to lose his dad, too. [scoffs] We're broke. Where would we even get the money? What? No. No way. [Tommy] No way. It's the only way. Tommy, he owes you.

[laughs] [rock music plays] [siren wailing] [mid-tempo music plays] The Gare Saint-Lazare, Paris. In 1933, something was captured near here by artist and photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson. Armed with a revolutionary new camera, he shot a moment. This moment. It took only a fraction of a second to bag, but came to be known as "a decisive moment", now the most familiar concept in all of photography. It's a strategy that has illuminated photography's potential for all of us. In Germany that same year, Hitler's National Socialist Party enjoyed its own moment. Within six years, the decisive moment and the historical moment would collide on the battlefields of Europe. The result would be iconic images of war by legendary photojournalists like Robert Capa. Photojournalism was born in the chaos of modern warfare. But when the fighting finally stopped, the question remained of just how good photography had been at explaining what all the blood and suffering had been about. (Danto ) We thought that was the world. Now we realise there were a lot of myths in that. I mean, trusting the photograph was probably a huge mistake from the beginning. This is Henri Cartier-Bresson, the godfather of photojournalism. From the early 1930s, he prowled the streets, snapping moments, fleeting action that found its perfect expression and true meaning through the content and composition of the picture. Bresson, a surrealist sympathiser, always maintained that he was first and foremost a painter, but his "decisive moments" transformed the face of photography. (Meyerowitz) Bresson's pictures were about being in the right place at the right time. He could step into a space and see the theatrical possibilities. It might be at the top of a flight of stairs that wended their way down to the street below, and he had a sense, "If I hang out here, someone's gonna bike along." He understood that into this space life will come. So it's a game of pounce. Cartier-Bresson was a... had been a big-game hunter. He'd...he'd gone shooting things and he was a stalker. You had to wait for this animal to appear. You stalked that animal, and at that moment you had to be ready to shoot. Photographers pounce on this fraction of a second because there's a capacity to read all of this flux of...of daily life, and see in it, in that tiny moment, some truth. (Train chuffing) Bresson's photograph of a man jumping over a puddle in Paris is a classic example of a decisive moment, seemingly casual but charged with significance. To some people it's a picture of a guy jumping over a puddle, but there...there's that sort of generic European Jewish name on the poster. There's the guy jumping into the unknown. The broken hoop. The first thing, probably, man ever made was a wheel, and this is a broken one. And throughout history, people have referred to the broken hoop and the wheel that's cracked and so forth. That must have been for hundreds of years the biggest...thousands of years, probably the biggest disaster that could happen to anyone is have your wheel break. He was the Nostradamus of the early '30s who predicted what was gonna happen to Europe in that one single image. Europe jumping into the unknown. And it's a great, great photograph for that reason. The interesting thing about photography is that you know when you press that shutter whether that visual orgasm has occurred or not. You sort of know it. It...it bypasses bits of the brain that... and your eye. You just know it. The feeling you get when you look at it, which is that this guy has turned round and snapped, and caught a moment, that's not how it was. And I think that...that's a big fantasy that the photography world has suggested, is that people have just got this kind of God-given gift of capturing something. (Oliver Chanarin ) So many decisions have been made, in quite a measured way, up until the point that that picture was taken. The photographer's decided where to be, they've decided once they're there where they're gonna take the picture from, what camera they're gonna use, what film they're gonna use. They've made all these decisions. That he'd waited for it? Yeah. That doesn't mean to say that he said, "Here's 50 francs. Jump over this puddle." Or "Can you bring a broken hoop in?" Nonsense. Of course not. He saw something. He pushed the camera through a gap in the fence and got what I have personally described as "the greatest photograph of the 20th century". (Danto ) You've got to remember about Cartier-Bresson that he was a surrealist. That was his milieu. The...the surrealists really did believe that there was a super-reality behind appearances, and occasionally it would reveal itself, and you'd just have to wait for that to happen. - (Gasps ) - (Shutter clicks ) That's what makes me gasp, you know. - (Shutter clicks ) - I'm awake. When the action enters the physical space, he knows how to time it so that it reaches its apogee... - (Shutter clicks ) - ..at a point, and that's the decisive moment. Bresson was only able to capture such moments because of a revolutionary development in camera technology. The Leica, launched in Germany in 1925. Compact, quiet, and with the latest lens technology, it gave birth to a whole new style of instant photography. (Danto ) He must have had one of the first Leicas. There couldn't have been very many on the market. He...he was a rich boy. He had enough money, at any rate, to have that. And I think that was the moment, in...in a way, that nobody ever would have anticipated. It allows...allows you to really be present in the moment and glide through the moment. The thing about it is that the window is here so when you look through the camera this eye is open so that you can actually watch the world. Most other single-lens reflex cameras go in front of your face so they block off the vision. The Leica was the chosen tool of Hungarian-born photojournalist Robert Capa, who became famous for capturing the ultimate in decisive moments... - (Shutter clicks ) - ..the death of a Spanish Civil War soldier cut down by a bullet in 1936. When civil war became world war, in 1939, Capa brought fame, heroism and charisma to the war photographer. Working for Life magazine, he maintained that the first rule of photojournalism was to get close and the second, to get closer. It earned him a reputation as the world's greatest war photographer, and its first real celebrity. I envied him because he was handsome and he attracted all the women. And Capa was a superb journalist. I always hesitated to call him a great photographer, but I called him a great journalist. It was astounding, I think, to me as a young teenager, that a photographer could risk his life. The idea that photography was that important was simply mind-boggling. Ultimately what one wants to say is, "This picture, I believe it, "because of that name under it, or on the back of the print," because we know that he sticks to what photography's always been best at doing, which is capturing reality. People believe pictures. It's a photograph that's in your passport, not a painting. Now, George Bernard Shaw said, "I would exchange every painting of Christ for one snapshot." That's what the power of photography is. The power of a famous photojournalist like Capa was to be able to choose his battles, to drop in and out of the conflict. In less glamorous circumstances, Tony Vaccaro photographed World War II, not on assignment but on a daily basis as an ordinary GI. Tony had been a soldier in the war, and, of course, soldiers don't get recognition for their photo... He had been a...a soldier photographer, and he made perhaps the best pictures of World War II of any soldier photographer. The camera was always on my neck, never on my shoulder. On my neck. And a gun always here. And I could easily hold the gun and do this. (Shutter clicks ) (John Morris ) It's strange that some photographers who deserve great recognition never achieve it. My guess is that Tony was primarily a journalist even as a soldier. And I think that's why his record of the war from a soldier's standpoint is so outstanding. The regular soldier photographer was expected to record events with standard army equipment. The issue camera was the Speed Graphic. That's insane. Here it is, the Speed Graphic. You focus through there. You can, er... This has two pictures. The film is placed underneath this. You close this. You see the accident? I pulled both out. Then you look through here to take a picture. Turn it over. Meantime, bullets are going around. See what things can happen. Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Thirty-two pictures. 35mm camera. All we need is 36 here. (Shutter clicks ) Vaccaro's ambitions to be a photojournalist meant that he had to do better than the cumbersome Speed Graphic. Unlike Capa, he couldn't afford a Leica and went to war with the more modest Argus C3. (Vaccaro ) I am compared with Robert Capa quite often, because he took a picture of a soldier dying in front of his camera, I took a picture of a soldier dying in front of my camera. He maintained, and he got this from Hemingway, that war is romantic. I'm sorry. I said, "Bob, you are dead wrong." As a soldier, Vaccaro couldn't help but be close to the action. Closer even than Capa. When a German tank was bombed right in front of his eyes, it was photography, not survival, that he was thinking about. I see the turret open, and came out this person. He was fine, but soon as he opened the turret, he blew up. Something happened that diesel went all over, and he's burning. I heard his... "Mutter, Mutter. " "Mother, Mother, " he was saying to himself. Now I am down. I felt that the picture should be taken a little higher. And so I went on the tip of my toes, and as I am there and clicked, I hear bullets hitting the tank, on this side, "Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh!" and I dove and landed here with my head. I stayed down and I look at him and I read what he has here for the first time, "Gott mit uns," "God is with us." 0n D-day, the greatest military operation in history, involving over one million men on the Allied side alone, Robert Capa was the only photojournalist who went with the first wave of troops onto 0maha Beach to capture nothing less than the very face of history in the making. Everyone was waiting for pictures. Life magazine was under extreme deadline pressure to publish. But it was 48 hours before picture editor John Morris received Capa's exposed film. So I asked the darkroom to rush development and there were four rolls of 35mm and Bob had written a note saying that all the action was in those four rolls and those were the... the pictures he took as he'd landed. And a few moments after I gave the command, if you want to call it that, this young hysterical darkroom boy came rushing into my office saying the films were all ruined, and I said "What happened?" and he said, "Well, you were in such a hurry, "I put the...the four rolls in the drying cabinet and closed the doors," which was not normal procedure. And there was too much heat and the emulsion ran. So I ran back and found that there were... three rolls were gone but on the fourth there were 11 frames and those are the ones that, fortunately, survived. These are perhaps the most famous of all war images, pictures that say as much about the challenge of being in the right place at the right time with a camera as they do about the experience of fighting for your country and for your life. Without the luxury of a magazine back home waiting to process his vulnerable film, Tony Vaccaro decided to develop it himself on the battlefield in soldiers' helmets. But he needed the right chemicals. (Tony Vaccaro ) One day, I went into a town called Saint-Denis, and I found the ruins of a camera store. I look in... I start removing rocks, and there it is, you know? The chemicals. I'm standing in a foxhole, and I put the chemical in the first helmet, water in the next, hypo in the third and water in the fourth helmet. And a moonless night. June of 1944. And I remove the film from the cassette and I start my first roll, you know, going like this. And I had one of those timers that I could see at night, you know. I would check 11 minutes. And at 11 minutes I shake it a little, went into the water a couple of turns, then into the hypo for five minutes. I check the time, and then, er...shake it a little. And into the water. Change the water a couple of times. That was it. And I'd hang the film, the negatives now, on the branches of the nearest tree. And next morning... And I went to sleep and the thing is there. (Chuckles ) So I went to sleep. I woke up. I look. Perfect. But the ten rolls Vaccaro developed that night were destroyed by the army censor. They contained images of dead GIs, decisive moments the world wasn't yet ready to accept. After the war, Capa went to Hollywood to take pictures on the set of Hitchcock's film Notorious. Tony Vaccaro stayed in Germany, photographing its occupation and reconstruction. What had photography really done for our understanding of events in World War II? It had captured important moments, many of which were close up and personal. It seemed good at effects but bad at causes. It suggested that history is about more than meets the eye. There is so much more to the things that we think we know from afar, that the closer you get to it, the more complex it is, not the simpler it is to understand. When you're photographing anything to do with war and conflict, you're photographing something impossible, you're photographing a... Everything you do is just clumsy and stupid and half-witted, because it's impossible to...to portray the full width and breadth of the things that you're up against. It's kind of like from a...the difference of maybe looking at a mosaic from afar where you have a myriad of pieces that give you a sense of an image, and then the closer you get to it, it starts to pixelate and fall apart, but you really have to stand far back, and the closer you get, the less sure you are of how well these little pieces fit together. (Narrator) Photography had already shown that there was an alternative to being in the right place at the right time. This is Roger Fenton's picture, called The Valley 0f The Shadow 0f Death, taken in 1885, a year after The Charge 0f The Light Brigade. Cannonballs were all he had to play with but it says as much about the nature of war as any image from the front line. That's a picture that has no dead bodies in it, no exploded buildings, but it's a powerful picture in terms of what was the experience like to have been in that place at that time, to have saddled on and clippety-clopped "half a league, half a league onward" through that hail of cannonballs. And yet the picture doesn't have any of those things in it, apart from just this detritus of cannonballs. It draws you in and says, "Imagine what it would be like for you to run through this place." The history of photography is littered with images taken long after the event, pictures that still speak eloquently about what had already happened. This is a photograph of a bullet-torn, bloodstained shirt, the one worn by the Archduke Maximilian when he faced a Mexican firing squad. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, photography's task became horribly simple, to provide undeniable historical proof of Nazi atrocities, documenting crime scenes of unimaginable proportions. But after the war, the tangled relationship between photography and historical truth would become apparent even in a calamity as black-and-white as the Holocaust. (Ringing) This is Lodz in Poland, the site of an infamous Nazi ghetto. It was here that Henryk Ross, along with 164,000 other Polish Jews, was incarcerated for four years until the ghetto was liquidated in 1944. But Ross was a photographer, and he kept a unique record of what really happened here. The Nazis had put the running and policing of the ghetto in Jewish hands, a situation that created a system of privilege among its inhabitants. There were those who had the merest chance of survival... and those who had none. Among his many duties as one of the ghetto's official photographers, Ross had to document the production of goods by the inhabitants of Lodz, sold to make money for their captors. Ross was a propaganda photographer at one level. I mean, he was employed by the Department of Administration and Statistics. He produced identity card pictures. He worked within the graphics department that had the responsibility for promoting the goods that were made in the ghetto and which many people would... would view as a form of collaboration. This building was the Department of Administration and Statistics, where Ross worked. Although he had become a propaganda photographer for his German jailers, he was a photojournalist before the war. Simply by looking out of his office window here, he could see that life for the Jews was becoming progressively worse. He decided to document it. We're in the apartment of some people whose breakfast we've interrupted. So this is where the... the bridge was over the main street. This is Zgierska Street, part of the main thoroughfare of Lodz, which was known here as Aryan Street. And initially when... I think when the ghetto was set up, Jews could cross at leisure, but gradually restrictions came in and...and the bridge was built and at the point that Jews couldn't walk on the street at all. Lodz wasn't a death camp but it was a staging post. Most of its inhabitants were eventually deported from here on trains, never to be seen again. The early deportations were to Chelmno, which is in that direction. That was the death camp that the...the Nazis initially set up. And as they perfected their methods at Auschwitz, which is in that direction, that's where the majority of the Jews of Lodz were ultimately sent. Part of the way Ross saw his role, his responsibility, even, as a photographer, was to document what was happening here and he was able one night to smuggle himself in, spent the night in the building to the side here, documenting one of the deportations, as German troops herded people onto these carriages or carriages like them. He almost certainly would have been killed, as...as would his family, had he been caught. (Birdsong) This is what remains of the hospital in Lodz Ghetto, where Ross photographed Jewish police preventing the sick and elderly from escaping, knowing that they were being rounded up for deportation. (Chris Boot) Ross obviously enjoyed free movement within the police. I mean, the Jewish police had no problem with him, and it doesn't look from the pictures like they had a problem with him photographing them. So I don't think he was taking the same degree of risk as he was down at the railway station while people were being deported on trains. This was him trying to use his camera as a vehicle for recording these important moments. I mean, the other pictures that he took that he was clear that he was risking his life taking was of the hangings in the ghetto square. Before the liquidation of the ghetto, Ross buried all his negatives in this garden, hoping they might survive even if he didn't. Amazingly, both he and the negatives did, and in 1961 his most incriminating pictures helped hang war criminal Adolf Eichmann. But there were other photographs Ross had taken that had no place in the courtroom and until recently no place in our image of the Holocaust. As well as his other pictures, Ross had, in an unselfconscious way, photographed the everyday life of the ghetto, including marriages, religious ceremonies, and parties. In these pictures we see a happy, well-fed Jewish elite and scenes that show some uncomfortable truths about the ghetto system, like a little boy dressed up as a Lodz policeman in his own ghetto-made uniform, playing a game of "arrest your best playmate". The battle over this material is partly the argument... partly rests in the argument that nobody... there was no joy in the ghetto, and these pictures certainly do challenge that. Contrary to any thought that they might complicate the picture of German cruelty, or any question about the extent of the Holocaust, they actually give a very, very clear idea of how the German war machine in that period managed the Holocaust. There's something very immediate about photography. There's something very powerful about these pictures. You can't look at these pictures without knowing that everyone... or almost everyone in them was killed before the war was over. Photo-historian Chris Boot recently published a more representative selection of Ross's images as well as organising public events to discuss the pictures. Anyone who had survived the ghetto might now see them for the first time. I was sitting with my daughter and we started seeing these photographs, and suddenly I said, "Oh, I knew this person." Another photograph appeared. I said, "I knew this person." And we come to the last photograph, and I looked at this photograph and I said, "I knew this person very well, "this man playing the accordion was my boyfriend, my first love, "and...and in the camp." And suddenly my daughter, who sat next to me, said to me, "But, Mummy, you are next to him." Well, I was just... I was laughing, crying, I... I just didn't know how to react. It...it was amazing. Amazing feeling. No, there were fun times. There were concerts. There were theatres, Jewish theatres. There were hairdressers, there were... It was a little Jewish state. And hunger, yes. You...you eat pieces from the wall. You eat any...anything. And...and for many years, I didn't want to think about it. - (Man ) Are you glad to see those pictures? - Yes, absolutely. Yes. (Man ) More than you're upset by them? More than I'm sad, yes. I'm... I'm very pleased to see them. In Japan, the photographic legacy of World War II proved to be even more indecisive and tangled than in the victorious West. The physical impact of the war here had been so different that even the simple act of conveying its horrors wasn't easy. (John Dower) These cities were so crowded and the construction was so flimsy that they dropped almost 100% incendiaries and just burned out the cities. There is no really stunning photography of Japan after the war comparable to the photography of German cities because the German cities always have those masonry and church steeples rising to the sky. There were still things standing. But here everything is flat burned out. There aren't even any bomb craters, and so it's very difficult to photograph. In two of the most decisive moments in history, August 6th and August 9th 1945, the Americans detonated atomic bombs above the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Two flashes killed over 200,000 Japanese in an instant. The American military's photographic records of what remained are extensive. But unlike photographic records of the Holocaust, their pictures completely ignored any evidence of human suffering. They were interested in physical damage, because their task was to measure, "What is the effect of the bomb 100 metres, 200 metres, "1,000 metres, 8,000 metres from the epicentre?" What the Americans turn their cameras away from is the human victims. This is a surviving copy of the very magazine that finally delivered photographic evidence of the human cost to the Japanese, seven years after the event. Japanese photographers had begun taking pictures within hours of the blasts but their images were confiscated by the Americans and suppressed until the end of their occupation. Jostling for position next to ads featuring Grace Kelly lookalikes, these are the images that helped Japan begin to view itself not only as the aggressor but also the victim. But pictures like these were still nowhere to be seen when photography made its most public statement on behalf of humanity only three years later. Photography's big response to a world rapidly moving from hot to cold war was this. The Family 0f Man, an exhibition that opened in New York in 1955, comprised of over 500 images, from 273 photographers both amateur and professional. It was selected from literally millions of images. Five travelling versions toured the world, netting nine million visitors by 1964. Staged as a walk-through version of Life magazine, it would be the most popular photographic show of all time, photography's biggest moment. (David Campany ) We'd had 20 or so years of mass-media magazines. It's just at the dawning of television. So in many ways it's a last statement about photography as the defining mass medium of the age. That statement is still standing over 50 years later inside this fairytale-like castle in Clervaux, Luxembourg. The exact same prints, carefully orchestrated to preach the exact same humanistic message, "We're all the same underneath", can still be seen in all its timeless naive wonder. 0r you can buy the book, which has never been out of print. There is a sense of the audience for the show being encouraged into a kind of dream state, something rather removed, actually, from social realities. Although the pictures all come from social realities, they're brought together to make this slightly abstract tone poem about what it by Girdhar, And one with a female dancer. If it is acceptable to you. Then I will accept you as my student. Baba, it is easier said than done What does she knew about the hardships of art? Tell me, what I have to do, sir?

Madam never said so, it's your own interpretation. Don't make me angry. Keep your maid in control, she is very short- tempered. You also keep this bear in control. Tell her, that I am waiting I am not waiting for you, I am waiting for Neela. She is not at home. Gone for a walk. For a walk. Alone! Not alone, with Girdhar I don't care with whom! But Whenever I come she is not at home. Hello sir. Hello, don't touch it. How was your journey? It was fine! I was more worried about Neela"s rehearsal, Hope everything was ok. Yes. Yes, they are out on a walk. This is no time for walk... Time is just fine sir. What do you mean? Very simple! Evening time is best for romance. Look Mani, don't try to instigate me against Neela and Girdhar. I have full faith in Girdhar. I too, but don't forget, they are young. Anyway. Goodbye. Hello Baba. God bless you, what about rehearsal? Neela is not well. So we went out for a walk. No rehearsal in my absence? She did it, Baba. For which dance? Tandava of Lord Shiva...? No Baba... Oh...! Then Mani was right. Do you know, why I have been to Benaras? For the festival and costumes. Look, here are these costumes. This is our tradition, To carry forward it, should be your objective This objective will never be completed, if you waste your time with Neela like this. I am sorry. I know... she is responsible for this. Don't ever repeat it. Otherwise we will leave this place. What is the matter Neela? White dress and looking sad.? Today we will practice, the dance of "separation". It will suit you also. "Girl is waiting for her beloved but he did not come". Tell me Girdhar, Baba is angry with me? No "Then she got hopeless. And started throwing away her ornaments". Don't hide from me, is it true that you are going to leave this house? Don't be silly... you don't know the truth. Then tell me the truth. Sir is only saying, we should not waste our time otherwise, he will leave this house. Don't get angry. Look at me, don't cry. Do you have some time? . I want to talk to you. Having nice time with Girdhar these days? And why not? After all both of you are living together. Now onwards both of them, are going to stay with me. Why. What is your problem...? I can't tolerate your love for Girdhar, He will only come here for rehearsals. I won't allow you to do so. This is what I want.! I have always taken care of you, I don't want to hurt my feelings. But I never accepted your love. Maybe! But I helped you a lot. I thought you are a gentleman. But now, I know what you are. I am not a coward. You have proved it, and listen. Girdhar and Baba will stay here if you don't like it. Then. Then I should not come here that is all you want to say. But I can't forget you Neela. Don't touch me... Go, your god is waiting for you, but remember only I can help you. Your intimate conversation is over? Oh... you are jealous. ...but why do you care? You are going to leave my house Don't talk rubbish... it hurts me. Oh. What a surprise! You also have a heart.? If you talk like this. I will leave this house. The way Lord Shiva left Parvati? And then, Parvati searched for Shiva, dressed up like a tribal woman. I too found you. Neela... Baba... Drink the milk and go to sleep. Baba will there be rehearsal tomorrow? Yes! But for a different dance. "Saint Vishwamitra prayed for thousands of years And cast his indelible imprint on the world. By virtue of his prayers power. Vishwamitra created a world of his own. He challenged Lord Indra, Out of fear Lord Indra sent the most beautiful and clever Fairy of the heaven... Menaka". Neela are you ready? Neela. You have spoiled 20 years hard work of Girdhar. Why would I do that...? For yourself... Is it not true that you have entangled Girdhar in your love? Not at all sir. I swear my love is sacred. Swearing again! You don't feel ashamed...? Don't forget, your promise, that you will be committed to dance Only. And will not involved in absurd things like... Love. Let's go Girdhar we won't stay here even for a minute. No Baba, I love Neela. What! You are in love with Neela? Then what about dance...? I can't live without Neela. You fool... get out from here. He is in love with Neela, What should not have happened, has happened. I have lost the battle. Don't say like this sir. First I lost his mother, now you have snatched Girdhar from me Why did you do that.? If you say. I will stop meeting him. That won't help. I will go away from here. He will become a wanderer, and search you In every corner of the world. I am ready to give up my life. So you want to burden me with a sin...? Then... what do I do sir? Now you cant do anything, I myself have to do something. What is that? I will go somewhere. But sir... what about your dreams? Your expectations? Your dancing bells have destroyed my dreams, now with the ashes of my dreams, I will go and sit on Girdhar's mothers memorial. Oh my god... What should I do? Neela... Neela where are you going...? Come... I will drop you. No... Wait Mani, I am coming. Going with him again? Yes! After all he is a old friend. Then. Why this... hypocrisy? You have betrayed me. You may say so. Shameless women! Baba... I will also come. You were right, she has betrayed me. Forgive your son Baba. Cool down son. I will get my luggage, Don't worry about the competition, we will find someone else. Thank god! We got rid of them. But what will happen to Madam.? She will marry... Manilal. You don't know the matters of heart, Because you don't have one. My heart... You will see that I was right. Let me call Madam. Stop it here. I want to get down. What is this? I was only fooling Girdhar. First you make a fool of him, now me. What is this nonsense? You are ditching me. Yes. I have ditched you all. I am ditching to my own self. You go away ...otherwise I will jump into the river. Go to hell You betrayer! No I am not, my love is sacred, Spotless... I am not a betrayer. Let the world say. Whatever it wants to say But you cannot say so. I am not a hypocrite. You betrayer! Hypocrite! No I am not. For god sake, keep quiet. You are very lucky, god saved you. Why did you save me god? You should have called me to your abode. Don't say such things. Good lady. Don't call me good lady. I have given pain to people. I don't deserved mercy, I am a sinner. Please come. Have a seat, let me call her. Oh. It's you? Yes sir your old student, Roopkala. What are you doing. Touch his feet. Forgive me sir. Cant forgive you... you had destroyed my hard work, for money I have no place for you. Have mercy on us, give her one more chance, please sir. Sir, you hardly have time to groom someone else, You have worked a lot upon her. Ok, as you wish. Madam... What are you doing here.? I was searching for you Madam. I am tired. You will be tired, if you continue wandering like this. It's not wandering around. It's sacrifice. Don't spoil your life... I may have spoiled my life but, I have found my heart in his memory. Till he wins Nateshwar award, I shall remain like this. But for that, you have to survive. Don't worry about me. I have come here to take another chance, You still have time. Don't waste your life. I am not wasting my life. My love is sacred. It cannot be a one sided affair. I don't care, he must win the award, That is all what I want. (remember only after winning the award, he will think about marriage) Are you sure, that he will win? I have full faith in his talent and my prayers. I am willing to sacrifice my life for him. If you do that, what will happen to me? I will see to it, that he should not win. Where are you... Have you gone mad? I don't feel like dancing. What are you saying...? Get up. Neela... Are you talking to me? Yes. But I am not Neela, I am a devotee of Lord Krishna. I can't forget you. Neela. You need peace, this restlessness... Will not give you anything. You are my life Neela, let's go somewhere else, Far from here to fulfill our dreams. Come to your senses. Concentrate on your dance. These preachings don't suit you, You are playing another game to make fool of someone else. I will kill you. Stop it Girdhar... you fool, if you kill her, You will be hanged. May what come... I will finish her right now. Stop it... cool down. Today you are saved, but, if I see you again, I shall finish you. Why are you adamant to destroy him.? Get lost. I am going away, you will not see me again, Even the news of my death will not reach you. Madam has disappeared again. Again... where she would have gone? I am looking for her since last 4 days. Let's not waste any time... Let's go and search her. We are lucky Badalu, perhaps we can use his car. But how? Just see. What is the matter? Madam has disappeared again, I ask him everyday to search, And I call her every day, come on. Is there enough fuel in it? Yes... Don't worry you will find your car somewhere. Wait... wait... where are you going? Stop... please stop. What is the matter? There lying a woman, unconscious, Please take her to the city. No thank you sir... one woman is enough for me. I say stop! Oh... Madam. Madam She is your Madam? I am Bindiya, let's go home. You are looking very ill Madam. Yes...! I know I won't survive . but before I die. I want to meet him for once. They say everybody dies empty handed Weather my desires shall also remain unfulfilled? Don't let this happen. Where do you want to go Madam? Nateshwer temple. Attention! All and sundry, The chief is coming. Ladies and gentleman since last many days, Nateshwar competition is in progress, Those who have participated, have been defeated By Master Mangal's son Girdhar. There is no one to compete with him now, therefore... Stop... Competition is not yet over, There is another artist to compete with Girdhar Mr. Ramprasad from Agara. Good... now we will see the battle between these two. One who wins, will be the claimant for the duet dance. And will have the opportunity to win Natraj award. Please start. Girdhar my son, go ahead... If you defeat him, I will give you Rs. 5,000. Not 5,000, I want 10,000. You start first. Very good... great... Well done... Strange! What happened? Medicines are not effective, but, With the sound of dancing bells she is becoming conscious. Very good... Great performance. Friends today is the last day of the competition, Now Girdhar will perform Tandav dance with Roopkala. After this there will be Pooja dance, and in the end, The award will be given. I cant betray him... Then betray yourself. I am giving you Rs. 15,000... think again. You won't be able to earn this much of money, Throughout your life. "Centuries ago when the world was dominated by torture and sin. Then Lord Shiva got angry. He started Tandava to destroy the world, Gods and human being, both went to Goddess Parvati, Without caring for her life Parvati went to Lord Shiva and pacified him". This is the story behind Tandava dance. Now you will see Girdhar and Roopkala, as Shiva and Parvati. What are you doing Roop. Come to your senses. I have not come here... to listen to your abuses, I am going. Forgive us. Because of ill health Roop is unable to perform Girdhar will play Shiva and Parvati . simultaneously. But this is not possible. Sir I request to give Ramprasd one more chance, He is ready with his partner. Friends since Girdhar is unable to perform. The opportunity is given to Ramprasad. Girdhar... Vacate the stage. He will not go... I will dance with him you? Baba? You don't worry about me. Start the dance. "Tandav dance created havoc on the earth. The earth was crumbling". What are you doing Girdhar? Go away. "Then Parvati requested Lord Shiva" Whatever I did was for you only, I want you to win this award, Trust me Girdhar. "Finally Shiva cooled down and handed over the trident to Parvati". We have witnessed a great performance, The Nateshwar award is given to Girdhar. Where are you going Neela? My mission is over. You have helped Girdhar winning the award, You have fulfilled your duty of a true student, Lord Nateshwar is also happy, but where is my Dakshina (fee) I will do whatever you say. Now onwards you will serve the cause of art as man and wife.

In a severe and bloody battle for the Dukla pass, marshal KoneV's troops have fought through, almost reaching the CzechosloVak border. we will tell you a story of Czech and slovak people, who loved their homeland more than anything else and who were willing to fight for it and die for it as heroes. we will tell you about their unit, born in the midst of the Great Patriotic war in the brotherly soviet Union and named the First CzechosloVak Tank Brigade. The representatives of the CzechosloVak government in London arrived at front: Monsignor Hala, Minister Nemec, and general HasaI. general, commander of the First independent CzechosloVak Tank Brigade, Major stasek. I report at your order, sir! These are only light bombs. - Light. No thanks. So it is you the tankist. I received that request of yours. I really didn't know what to do, general. Nonsense. Do you think I came here to get you some tanks? why don't you turn to the Defence Ministry in London? I'Ve done that several times, but it was useless. what do they know about us! - They know enough, don't be mistaken. How many tanks have you got? - Only ten now. your losses are that big? we'Ve been fighting for a long time. People are doing what they can, but... general, the air raid has stopped. Maybe you could help us, nonetheless. we want to fight. we all do. If someone told me that we would be returning this way. The paths of God are unpredictable, my friend. It may sound nice, but this path leads to Prague, Monsignor. you keep looking at me, yet you still don't recognize me? Andrej PaVIoVic! - Indeed. I swear I would not recognize you without your beard. They burnt my beard, sonny. They set ablaze the tank and my beard with it. you know each other already? yes, Lieutenant colonel MalinceV was our teacher in TamboV. In the tank school. And how did they do? Tell me, were they good students? Good, Comrade general. And to climb with a tank, did they teach you that in TamboV, too? what do you mean by climbing? - Up the hill. you know what I mean. yes, they did... depending on what the hill is like, of course. The bad one. you can see for yourself. avery bad hill. Tomorrow morning we will attack the stronghold on this slope. you will go this way. you will climb up with the tanks and strike them from behind. So what do you think, can you do it? we can. That's not a problem, but... - I know. The tanks! Alright, we will give you fifteen our tanks. what do you say to that, Andrej PaVIoVic? But wherefrom? I really don't know, Comrade general. And what about your regiment? have you forgotten about it? But my regiment has its own tasks to fulfil. So you won't give them? If it's an order... - wait! leave orders out. I can always give you one, anyway. I want you to decide for yourself. After all, they are your students. And they are going to battle tomorrow for the first time on their native land. Alright, I'll send them in the afternoon. And don't be rough on your people. If you have people, you'll have tanks. New, almost new! Dad, do you hear me? The new one! - Like straight from the factory. Really, like straight from the factory. Olinka. Olinka. Did you bring us something? Show me. Bandages. what good are your bandages to me. My heart is wounded, Olinka. A horseradish cake is best for that. what are you doing there! Go away from my tank! we won't make it dirty. - It's foul play anyway. There are no tanks for us and Sgt. Klimko is always first in line. Nonsense. The tanks were given to the best. I'Ve deserved it. - For your gabbing, I suppose. Do you know who Sgt. Klimko is? - Of course. you're the only tankist in the whole brigade. No. But it's the tank 'Janosik'. And I too have such rebel blood in my Veins. I take what I want. you and an outlaw! you're just an ordinary bighead. They used to play this song at Piccadilly, remember? Jozko, if only we could go back, at least for a few days. what for? To bat around at the ministry again? Not that. you can't understand that. you're a barbarian, that's the trouble. But it has to be a strike that will make the earth quake. As soon as we get up, we must attack them straight away. Is that clear? Just a moment, First Lieutenant. I wanted to ask you something. Do you know this? - I do. It's a letter received yesterday from our tankists at the training batallion. And you, instead of withholding it, you'Ve read it to the soldiers. Major, such letters are distributed among the soldiers by our officers. For example: "after you cross our borders, remember what Member of Parliament, Klement Gottwald, told us in JefremoV. Our republic will be such as what we fight for and win. Remember that, comrades. " It's pure demagogy! Listen, Blazek, how many times do I haVe to tell you to leave politics alone. That applies to all. I want to keep the brigade calm! But, Major... - you can leave. And you too. Those your troubles! you'd better prepare the attack, instead. you really amaze me. why are you butting into this? you're all blind and can't see, what's happening around you. Do you know how Flaubert puts it? The riffraff has flooded the world. One cannot achieve justice. Josef VasiljeVic, what's going on? Are your artillerymen dozing off? we are firing from all barrels, Comrade general. Comrade general, colonel ZurkoV is asking, what's with the tanks. colonel ZurkoV, are you an infantryman or a tankist? Infantry, right. Then tanks are none of your business! The tanks will come, when needed! Get me stasek. kiev, kiev, this is LVoV. Do you hear me? over. Fire a rocket! Tanks, Comrade general, tanks! Ahead! Ahead! everybody out! Lead the infantry! To CzechosloVakia! Jurka, look, where's your infantry. Look! over there! Do you see that? ! well, everything is fine. Now you'll go to the aid station. what? I'm not going anywhere. - Jura! leave me alone, women! I know myself what to do! So, you're home! Home... Deeply moved at this moment, when we are stepping on the sacred land of our republic, we send you joyful news, Mr. Prime Minister, that our troops and the Red Army have broken the resistance of Hitler occupants and crossed the border... general, a message from the soviet command. Breakthrough along the whole front. The soviet units along with our corps are fighting in the combat depth of the enemy defence. I beg your pardon, I'm not a soldier. Is it that much or little? It is a success, sir. - And did you Verify it? you must realize that the safety of the whole government delegation is at risk. I did. The road is safe, general. have the cars prepared, we're leaving in two minutes. And what about lunch? we might as well wait a few minutes longer. Gentlemen, we will have our lunch in czechoslovakia. Alright. Take it easy! - Dad! Attention! general, Sgt. Klimko. The squadron in the number of ten men is performing rescue work. Thank you. At ease. - stand easy! Tankists? - yes, from the First Tank Brigade. have a smoke, lads. Thank you. Thanks a lot. - So, looking forward to get home? Don't ever forget about this day, lads. It's famous and historical day. It's beginning of a new life. - Excuse me, Mr. Minister, what will it look like after the war? - what do you mean? well, they say that after the war everything will belong to the state. Is that true? No doubt that nationalisation may be of great significance. why are you so interested in this? you see, since I was ten I drudged for others. And I don't want to anymore. My friend, if we did not have to do, what we do not want to, it would be a swell world to live in. I didn't fight the fascists for landlord to fleece me naked until I die. It's true that some negotiations on nationalisation are underway, but I can't say anything certain now. - That's a pity. I beg your pardon? - I'm saying it's a pity that you can't tell us anything for certain. It's high time. Quickly, clear the way. Louts. If this were in England, I'd have them jailed on the spot. what can we do? One has to adapt here. All at once. All at once you are all adapting yourselves. The influence of the communists is growing at home every day, our units are becoming bolsheVised, and you? you are adapting yourself. you are making so much fuss as if we are facing a communist revolution. Not yet. But if it goes on this way... you see, I wouldn't like to run away again into emigration. How many can you repair? - Just six. Not more. Six. - And who will get them? we'll see. I can't give them to you both. Major stasek? - That's me. Lieutenant Tomes. I'Ve been assigned to your brigade as an educating officer. I know. welcome, I want you to meet... Second Lieutenant Kysela. First Lieutenant Blazek. Renc. - First Lieutenant Hrstka. you know, we are not Very particular about lectures. Look. we need the tanks. And all this is meant for repair? - No, for a parade, Lieutenant. Is it still there? - you'll keep badgering with the tank so long until they send us to drag it out. Hell, guys, knock it off! Better you let a guy get some sleep. Six attacks in one night, who could stand that. - Guys, coffee. And a newspaper. - watch out! at least it'll keep your feet warm. Come on, you talk too much and pour too little. Cold again. - what more do you want? Coffee and newspaper in the morning, that's like in a first-class hotel. If at least we had 'Janosik'. It was your fault, anyway. what did I do wrong? - everything! Say that again! Come on, guys, coffee's here. Go on and eat, lads. what's wrong with you? what... we can't stand it anymore, Lieutenant. Tell me, why did I become a tankist? To eat soil here, or what? They kept telling us: wait till you cross the border. So what? we are home and still with empty hands. How come? have you got a rifle? - A rifle... So, you'Ve got something to defend with and to fight with, don't you? Lieutenant, have you ever been at the front? I was and many times, too. During the first war already. At the PiaVa. No, at Caricin. you fought under Comrade Stalin at Caricin? Alright. But what war was it then, anyway. There weren't even tanks there. Tanks were there. And the Red Army men were there, too, and they could go against those tanks even with their bare hands. But there's no way you can understand that. Compared to them you are milksops and not soldiers. you shouldn't talk that way, Lieutenant. why not? you said you can't stand it. well, yeah, I did. - Aha. But I didn't mean it that way. you see... we can stand it... what kind of a meeting is this? Take your posts! Break this up! you are quite sentimental, aren't you? what makes you think so? - That you're so keen on memories. Memories are a nice thing. But you should realize that you're not a commissar of the Lugan regiment, but an officer of the CzechosloVak Army, Lieutenant! Be careful. you won't be agitating here. - Look, Captain, I report directly to the brigade commander. - And I am the chief of staff! you won't even whistle without me. But I'm not here to whistle. Forget about that and hold the light. I told you this would turn out bad. Nonsense, they're not there for the first time. They'Ve dragged out tanks many times. But then they had an experienced commander and not an educator. what? you let that educator go there? what... They're coming! A quite good tank. I hope that educator does not steal a march on us. It'll be ready tomorrow. you can ride off. Really? - Let's shake hands on it. - Sure. Lieutenant, the commander wants to see you. I'd sure like to know, who'll really get the tanks. The last one! They are ready tomorrow, we will sally the day after tomorrow and in a month in a month we can be in Kezmarok! And what if they don't give the tanks to us? why wouldn't they? The tanks are ours, aren't they? At least you will finally get rid of me, Olinka. why? It makes no difference to me. - Jura! will you invite us, in Kezmarok? - Sure, why shouldn't I. I'll invite the whole brigade! Friends, I look forward to be home so much. To see my mom. She is so... you know, so... you'll get to know her, she is... - well, like a mommy. I can't even describe it. - She'll be so happy. For her outlaw. - you... don't... you all have to come! we will drink, sing... And dance! - Dance! Olinka. Do you hear that? - Jurka, don't... Come now! It was from sheer happiness. Major, most of the repaired tanks were previously assigned to my battalion. why are you suddenly giving them Hrstka? Hrstka has more people than you. - But we will get more people. No, we won't get a single hand. general HasaI refused to add more men to all our units. Major, I know general HasaI personally. If you let me, I'll go to see him and I'll try to explain it somehow. you won't explain anything. He won't listen. At least I can try it. - Major... And you don't bow your head. you'll all get what you want. I won't give. Do you think that I recruit men just for you? I won't give you a single man. - general, we must make up for the losses. Otherwise, we will end up in a terrible situation. And you think that my situation is easy, don't you? The government wants security units for the whole territory from me. where am I to take them from? It is the core of our future army, gentlemen. The core of our future army is forming on the front. Two hundred kilometres from here, general. I won't argue. It is the decision of the government. Is that clear? you are dismissed. general, I report at your order. If you let in a command delegation once more, I'll kick you out of the door. what is it? A brief overview of communist activities inside the tank brigade. you should have come earlier. It wasn't possible. The situation is getting worse, general. And whose fault is it? we'll have to transfer you, my friend. what do you say to that? well, I was promised to be recalled back to London shortly. Indeed. you'd like to have your feet up in London, wouldn't you? you're all the same. There's not a bit of patriotism in you. The bars and career at the ministry. That's what you yearn for. No. That's not what I meant. In this case, I wish to remain in the tank brigade. I promise, I will prove... - we shall see. But actually the tank brigade does not exist any more. Atelegram arrived yesterday from London. The tank brigade and the artillery regiment are to be dissolved. Listen, did you ever shoot a deer? - yes, I mean... So you know what should be done, when the animal is dying. you mean... - I do not mean anything at all. I know, it's difficult, but we must cope with it as grown men. Tell me, how do you want to cope with this? And what do you want to do without the tanks anyway? what? I'd turn directly to the soviet armour command. without notifying our authorities? Do you know what it would mean? And do you know what it meant to us to put together only the first regiment? you would have to talk to them. In the end, they'll tell you that the brigade doesn't exist any more. who? - The general. The general... So, he's preparing our funeral before we even died? ! But we are still here! we still exist! Make ready the car. Let's go! where are you going? - To the front! To the tanks! where are your tanks? Jasko, my brother. I wasn't good enough for them. Did you hear me? Me, the best tankist in the brigade! never mind... yesterday, I had four tanks and today, I haVe none. yesterday, I had four tanks, today... what are you celebrating? well? Nothing. There's nothing to celebrate, Captain. what do you mean? yesterday the town of Kosice was liberated. Don't you know? we know. - How can that help us. Tell us. what will happen to us? - How am I supposed to know. Besides, why should we bother with that. Those who want to fight will always find a way. Some have already requested to be transferred to the artillery. And what will we do there? we are tankists not gunners. Tankists! what tankists if we don't get any tanks! Is it true, Captain? I'm afraid so. And clean this up. I understand you, but if someone else comes here, he might make a fuss about it. why to be so upset? Let's have a drink. There's nothing you can do anyway. Damned! To hell with everything. I'm sick of those men. - Nonsense! I would cry in rage myself. If someone told me I would be returning to the brigade this way. Come now. we are being dissolved, so what. That's it. It's nonsense to dissolve brigade under such circumstances. Jozka, you must understand. This is the beggining of the government's offensive against bolshevism in the army. They should be more concerned about getting the fascists out of the country. you're such an idealist. It is the only way left for us. we must turn to the soviet command. Sign it. we'll see. The soviets have never left us in the lurch. why should they help, when our own people are scrapping us? Vodka won't help here. If you'd stop being an educator at least for a while. why is it so hard for a man to part with his plans. you know, at the back of my heart I always believed that one day the core of our armour would grow from the men I am educating here. And that a piece of my work would contribute to that. I know, you think I'm a dreamer. Not at all! what kind of a person is it, if he can't look into the future. So look there! Look at how everything is crumbling in your hands! But why? It is our army at stake. - That's precisely it! This government will never let people, who were taught in the soviet Union, to educate our soldiers. - leave the government out! I bet that in London they don't know what the bureaucrats are doing here. you say the government. you would have to know how I felt when I was running away from Poland. I was a wretch. A refugee. A man without a homeland. And suddenly, we had our government. It was a symbol that CzechosloVakia exists once again. That we have a reason to live for. That we have something to fight for. Do you understand? - It wasn't because we had a government. But because our people never reconciled to the occupation. Because two hundred million of soviets are behind us. yes, that's true. I'm not saying. never mind, why should we argue? Soldier shouldn't meddle with politics. And what should he fight for? - For his homeland. Its liberty. what homeland? For a homeland, in which he would starve? Don't edify me! Go to hell with those politics of yours! Alright. Let's leave politics out. But what if your soldiers come to you? what if they want to know why all their sacrifices are suddenly worthless? what will you tell them? The truth. - Then you'd have to tell them that the government is afraid they might ask: why did you promise the rule of the people? why did you promise national councils when you are training future district representatives in London! - Shut up! Or... you'd have to tell them that the government wants to liquidate all of our eastern units. That's horrible. If this was the truth, then... whom should we trust? Olinka, please, write it on that machine. what is it? - Atransfer request. why? you want to leave the brigade? And what else can I do. Atankist without a tank. It's ridiculous. They took 'Janosik' away from me and they won't give us other tanks. who told you that? - everyone is talking about it. Captain Renc. And he also said that I'm not the only one to be transferred. So you'II leave us. And what will happen to the brigade? what will happen? Nothing. - How can you say such a thing? Don't you care? Could you leave just like that? Don't you have anything to stay here for? No, only if I stayed because of you. you, me... That's the trouble with you. you must get everything you wish. And if it's not your way, then... No, Jura, that's one of the things, why I couldn't be fond of you. If you don't want to, let it be. I won't beg you. I'll write it myself. - Please, do. I hope they'll transfer you soon. This way you'd be no good here anyway. you're a tankist only for parades. - For parades? Very well, then. Think it over. Is this your final word? final. Jarda, Jarda, did the bodysnatchers let you go? Hullo. How are you? what's new? - Jarda! Jarda! - Lieutenant, I report to service. Tell me, are you alright? I'm fine. when did you come? - what about your leg, does it hurt? No. I couldn't stand the hospital any longer. No wonder. - So, commander, you'Ve got all the gang together again. Jurka won't be your commander any more. He requested for a transfer. He wants to join the artillery. Don't think that I just... I don't feel easy about it, too Honest. Jura, we always went through everything together. And now when things are the worst you want to leave us? you know how they call this. I want to fight. Do you think I want to stay in hinterland till the end of the war? Do as you wish. But I feel ashamed that you were our commander. Ashamed! Understand? what? So you needn't feel ashamed! Is everything fine now? - Jura... leave me alone. I'll stay then, so that you can't call me a deserter. you'll remember me one day. what can we do. Atank would be better. Major, you wanted to talk to me. I did! Listen, are you the chief of staff or a local gossip? Major, I refuse such Vocabulary! Then why are you talking about the dissolution of the brigade? why do you talk about us never getting any tanks? Are we a bunch of cottagers, which they can ride down whenever they please? why are you so angry? It was our own fault, anyway. what? - That in London they look at us as communists. No wonder they want to liquidate us. And the government supports this? The government wants an army it can rely on. After all, what does our brigade mean? Nothing. Just a grain of sand. KEZMAROK - JANUARY 1945 Comrade Major, on behalf of the soviet Army, I hand over 60 tanks to the CzechosloVak Tank Brigade. Hurrah to the soviet Army! Jurka... - Auntie! where are my folks? - They killed them. The fascists came and... And my mom, too? - They killed them all. My dearest mommy... Andrej PaVIoVic, do you remember? - My students. How could I forget! Comrade Kysela. Do you still have problems getting tactics into your head? Still. Only the devil knows why, Andrej PaVIoVic. I think I don't have a brain for tactics. Do you accept girls into the army now? That depends. Are you married? - No. Do you have a boyfriend? - No. No? Let's dance, shall we? If I think that in a few days... they will be facing bombs and tanks in flames again... There's no other way. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. stupid philosophy. I'm not forcing it on you. - I wouldn't let you. Go and dance, you philosopher. have you heard? It was just on the radio. The president is flying to Moscow. They're rounding it out in all sorts of ways, but on the whole it seems that a new government will be set up. - with the communists? It seems so. why would he otherwise fly to Moscow? Then ours have won! - That's a lie! That will never happen, the communists will never decide on the fate of the republic! - what makes you think so? Because it's nonsense! They have no right to do that! And do they have the right to die? - That's enough! leave, immediately! Let's have a drink. yes. To the famous future of your people. KOSICE - MARCH 1945 This is the end. Absolute capitulation. stop it. There's always plenty of time for that. One never knows. If the communists really join the government... They should be shot! No government with them! I'd kick them in the pants. Stop yelling. Someone may hear you. you're such a coward. - So what? How will this help you? Go to hell! I'm sick of you. I don't like people who lose their nerves so easily. I'm not losing my nerves, but you must understand that everything is at stake. Look here. They are rolling at us from all sides and there is no force in Europe that could hold them back. Do you think that Benes flew to Moscow just for fun? He knows that the only thing he can do now is to adapt and wait. what do you want to wait for? who knows. Maybe one day we will be strong enough to strike back. But for the time being... - you will turn on your heel. you are even able to applaud their nationalisation talk. And you? I know you well enough. This will never happen. Do you understand? never! As I am announcing this Magna Charta of its kind of the slovak nation, on behalf of the government of the national front, allow me to add a few important words. The Red Army has brought you a freedom. you have your people's, national power in the form of slovak national council. you have your people's administration in the form of national councils. you are carrying out an act of historical significance by confiscating the land of enemies and traitors and by giving it to the hands of the slovak rural people. Realize that and take actions according to that. All for the support of the Red Army, the liberator! All for the front! All for the final Victory! Isn't it bizarre? The more primitive a man is, the more he shouts, when happy. - you aristocrat! stasek is sending me into attack with you. Did he tell you? yes. you know the terrain and you can be useful. All of a sudden. what the heck. I'll die as a hero. One sceptic more or less... It almost seems that you're afraid, Renc. Afraid? Nonsense. Afraid... I'm not afraid but angry, you see. Angry at whom? - At whom? everyone! HasaI sits in the government cooperating with communists and me? Do you know what he wants? I'd gain their confidence and send the reports. what reports? Maybe I could arrange it somehow. Tomes trusts you and I'd arrange for communication. Just imagine, what it could mean for our future. This is how you see your future. Do you want to die as a First Lieutenant? - No. But I won't spy on my mates. How could I look into their eyes? ! - Forget about that. I'd have to be such a rat as you are. Jozka, think about it. you'd regret it one day! Get lost! you'll die because of that idealism of yours. Olinka, how are you doing? I haVen't seen you so long, Olinka. If you never call on us. why should I? you'Ve told me that you don't like me. I was thinking a lot. you were right. And when I heard at home that my folks were killed... I felt ashamed for myself, honestly. If you weren't such a boaster. If one could really believe you. Olinka, If you loved me, would you believe me. Olinka, take care! OSTRAVA - APRIL 1945 It is quite clear, gentlemen. The Russians want to save the town and that is why they are circumventing us from the northwest. They think we will be forced to move out from OstraVa without a fight. In any case, this morning, I ordered to undermine factories and roads in the town. - For what case? general, I think we have to count with every possibility. you're not here to think. you know the Fuhrer's orders. Retreat is equal to treason! Damn you! Such actions won't stop the Russians. And who will? I will! I will stop the bolsheviks even if it costs the lives of all my soldiers! without leaving you out, gentlemen. Zero seven. what? yes. yes, I see. The Russians broke through to OpaVa. Get me details, immediately. general, should we stop the undermining? No, continue. what's wrong? Nothing. everything is alright. - Did you eat something? Not much. - I should'Ve thought so. It was close, they nearly got me. Look. They are laying charges here to the house by the river. The SS are on the watch everywhere. Look at it. I will get in somehow. I won't let you go alone, Milos. The committee decided that we should go together. where should you go? No one decides on that. Mom, please. Don't yell at me, you're too young for that. Josef, you know I'Ve always helped you. It's all the same to me, I'm old and I'll give my life if need be. But I won't give Milos. I won't, understand! Mommy, don't cry. everything is alright. These are just plans. I know those plans of yours. That's the front. It's been roaring since the morning. And we should sit hear with hands in our laps! But you're not a soldier. - No, I'm not. But it's six months now since they'Ve accepted me to the communist party. Mom... Don't be angry. - what can I do, Milos. yes, arrange that. I agree. So, is it clear, comrades? you'll enVelop stronghold from east and establish communication with MalinceV. After crossing the river, your brigade will protect his left flank against expected counteroffensiVe of the German tanks. And then OstraVa. It is your town. Make sure that you're first there. we will, comrade commander. we will, comrade commander. we won't get through! It's insane. Get back! Do you hear? Get back! Are you mad? Our people are on the other side, you can't cut them off! Get back! Andrej PaVIoVic, they're closing in upon us. I can see that. Keep the set direction! Jozka! - Coward... I'll have you court-martialed for this! Major! Major! Major! we're surrounded! They won't get us alive. Tanks. Let me go, I can die, if I must! To fight for your life that's what you must! Fire! Ours! Ours... Andrej PaVIoVic... I don't give a damn about your losses! I don't care. If you retreat by a single meter, I'll shoot you myself like a dog! general, the Russians are in the outskirts! you haVen't got any manners. you don't even knock. Pardon me. Damn cowards. The command is not answering. we'Ve lost connection. Volha, Volha, this is Don. Do you hear me? I haVe a message for you. over. Volha, this is Don. A message. we must get over the bridge. you'll go first, don't let them stop you. yes, sir! It may be undermined. Take only Volunteers. Did you hear? who doesn't want to, doesn't have to go. what the hell! It's not the first bridge we are crossing. Jurka! Take care of yourself. Don't worry, Olinka. They haVen't made such a bullet that would hit me! Major, task accomplished! you see, they didn't get me! Forward! Comrades. OFFICIAL ENTRY FESTIVAL OF THE ARTS 1955 A TOHO PRODUCTION I LIVE IN FEAR Produced by SOJIRO MOTOKI Screenplay by SHINOBU HASHIMOTO, HIDEO OGUNI, and AKIRA KUROSAWA Director of Photography ASAKAZU NAKAI Production Design by YOSHIRO MURAKI Music by FUMIO HAYASAKA Edited by CHOZO OBATA Starring TOSHIRO MIFUNE TAKASHI SHIMURA MINORU CHIAKI MASAO SHIMIZU EIKO MIYOSHI KYOKO AO YAMA HARUKO TOGO NORIKO SENGOKU AKEMI NEGISHI YOICHI TACHIKAWA KICHIJIRO UEDA, EIJIRO TONO YUTAKA SADA KAMATARI FUJIWARA KEN MITSUDA ATSUSHI WATANABE KIYOMI MIZUNO YA, GEN SHIMIZU TORANOSUKE OGAWA Directed by AKIRA KUROSAWA HARADA DENTAL CLINIC Father, telephone. Just a minute. Who is it? - The court. - Oh, I forgot! The court? Why? The dental association nominated him to be a family court arbitrator. Divorce suits, estate battles -- things like that. That's tough work. Actually, he really likes it, though he grumbles a lot. I have to be in court at 1 :00. Another afternoon lost. What have I gotten myself into? TOKYO FAMILY COURT DOMESTIC ADJUDICATION JUDGE ARAKI Please stay out here. He's provided for my daughter a long time -- Yes, but in this case -- We're not asking for ourselves, but there's the baby to consider. Please just wait here. Why can't I go in? I'm just as much his son as you. Enough out of you! How dare you talk to us like that! You're just his son-in-law. She may be illegitimate, but she's his flesh and blood. Listen, I don't see how this case concerns any of you. - Hold on! - We have a lot at stake! Listen, I think we all need to discuss it, but Father's very upset. We need to calm him down first. Once that's done, everyone can have their say. Please just wait here. - You heard me! - But I -- I don't know how you know Father, but you'll have your say as well. He's in quite a state! Listen to me: I'm a court mediator. I'm terribly sorry. Please, after you. - Damn fools! - Father! I just don't -- Welcome. I just don't get it. This is a family matter! Just butt out! I'm so sorry. Father's always like this. Ichiro, say something. This is too much. Father, you see -- Fool! We discussed it, and we asked them to -- That's right. We received a formal petition. Whatever it says, I won't recognize it! Legally, the petition -- Father, not recognizing it is like not recognizing us as adults. Tell me, does this bunch look like adults to you? These loafers think about nothing but my estate! Jackasses! - Father! We understand your feelings, Father. Don't we, dear? That's right. All Japanese people share your anxiety. It's just that you're a bit -- Right, Ichiro? Just say it! I'm insane! Why don't you listen? Father! Mother, please! Don't make a scene. Let's all just go home and -- We're here because we can't resolve this ourselves. We're just making a spectacle of ourselves. Ichiro... do something! This is terrible! You're the eldest! That's right. You're embarrassing us all. I'm sorry for the trouble we've caused. It's all right. This is our job. Family court exists precisely so you have a place to bring your troubles. We're happy to mediate in even the ugliest spousal disputes. And other disputes too: between parents, children, and siblings. Life's full of disputes, and bashing each other's heads solves nothing. So there's no choice but to enlist the aid of a third party. People need to speak openly so that resentment doesn't build. Our job is to listen to those pent-up frustrations. We listen to both sides and help you think through a solution. So what do you say? Why not let everyone have their say and let us help? Miss Tamiya, let's get started. Everyone please wait in the hallway. Father. Not consulting with me first! Fools! We've got our work cut out for us this time. Thank you for coming. Allow me to introduce Mr. Hori of the bar association. This is Dr. Harada. - Pleased to meet you. - Likewise. We should examine the petition. There's not much time, so I'll read it aloud. I'll skip the names and addresses of the parties. The aim of the petition is as follows: "I hereby request that Kiichi Nakajima --" The older gentleman. "be pronounced mentally incompetent on the grounds that the petitioner, wife of aforementioned Kiichi Nakajima, in June of last year discovered that her husband harbored delusional fears about atomic and hydrogen bombs and subsequent radioactivity atomic and hydrogen bombs and subsequent radioactivity. In September, seeking to avoid fallout from the south, and despite his entire family's opposition, he purchased 1.6 square kilometers of property in Akita Prefecture and began to construct thereupon an unusual underground dwelling. In November, after reading in a newspaper that fallout would come from the north, he halted construction. As a result, the family suffered the senseless loss of 7.4 million yen. Mr. Nakajima's erratic behavior did not end there. He now claims that the only safe place on earth is South America. He has unilaterally set in motion a plan to move all his dependents to Brazil and has announced that he site. I stopped him before he sold it to the highest bidder, but after I was done with him, the authorities arrested him for theft. They were less than understanding. In the gulf, The penalty for theft is loss of a hand. He vowed if we ever saw each other again, one of us would wind up dead. All right, Yusef, this is where we play good cop/bad cop. And I play? Guess. How does a proprietor make any money selling All of these disgusting provisions? Rhetorical question. SYDNEY: Actually, Nigel, in this part of the world, everything's got a market. Isn't that so, Baz? Sydney Fox, You... You must have a death wish. SYDNEY: Baz, Baz, Baz, Charming as ever. Where's Kafka? Right where you left him. SYDNEY: That's very funny. Where's the rest of him? Not here. I guess neither is his new client. Good lord. Oliver. Give the man back his glasses. NIGEL: Give me my glasses or I'll have to spank you. SYDNEY: Everyone has a price, Baz. How much for your old pal Kafka? I'm hurt you'd even think to ask. NIGEL: Don't break them. Experience tells me that's not a straight answer. You know what he would do to me. Do you remember what I did last time? I'm still repairing the damages. Look, Sydney, it's not my place to know all of Kafka's... I have no patience for liars. NIGEL: No, don't scratch the lens. Oh, where have you gone? [speaking arabic] Where is Shareem? I'll suck the life right out of you. Oh, Yusef, you really should ease up. I'm sorry, Baz, I can't seem to control this guy. Okay. It really hurts. NIGEL: Come here. When did Kafka leave? Yesterday. Took the rich kid to the well of Suerte. NIGEL: My eyes, no! The well of fate? YUSEF: It's an ancient bedouin landmark. It is in rebel territory now. Always a pleasure, Baz. SYDNEY: Nigel. Thank you very much. Oliver, yeah? Hey, Sydney, make sure you call next time. I'll be out. Follow them. YUSEF: We will need an extraction team to get Prince Shareem safely out of rebel territory. Believe me, he's in far greater danger from Kafka. All the more reason I must return and personally select the men. Got to go get old uncle Hosni's blessing? Yes. [train whistle] What about us? We'll continue on to the well by train. Here's my cell phone. You don't trust him. KAFKA: Your highness. All we've found are shards of clay. I based my calculations on your translation of the ancient scroll. Well, what if you've made a mistake? If the lamp is hidden near the well as you say, we're in the right place. [cell phone ringing] Kafka, I have news. If I want news, I'll watch CNN. Well as it has reported that Sydney Fox is on the hunt for your wealthy young client. Sydney Fox? Here in Morocco? Aren't you pleased? Baz, my old friend, pleasure barely describes it. NIGEL: Did you know he and the prince were raised like brothers? Yusef once told me that the prince's uncle Hosni hand-picked him at the age of seven to protect the prince's life. Thank god I brought my own. Protein bar? You? Looks like you made a friend. What am I going to do with him? No, thanks. Hey, hey. Karen. KAREN: Hey, Sanj. Can you do a British accent? Rather. What? Okay, I'll do the talking. Can you be somewhere at two this afternoon? I'll owe you, huge. Sure. So I... I hear that Sydney and Nigel left for the gulf to find Prince Shareem. I... I thought you should see this. A countryman of his was found dead near campus? Murdered? Well, their secret service is investigating. He was killed three days ago. That's the same day Shareem was pulled out of class. He's in more trouble than we thought. [cell phone ringing] Sydney? SYDNEY: Karen. Bad news. A countryman of Prince Shareem's was found dead on campus. SYDNEY: When? Today, but he was murdered three days ago. SYDNEY: The day Prince Shareem pulled out of class. I couldn't get any more information from the police but for all we know, with the unrest at home, Shareem's on the run and the assassin's still after him. Thanks, Karen. We'll be careful. That man's death is a very bad omen. SYDNEY: The well of Suerte. NIGEL: Looks pretty heavily guarded. Kafka doesn't mess around when he's milking a cash cow. Is that the prince? SYDNEY: Yeah. He seems fine. Time to call Yusef with the good news about Shareem. YUSEF: Thank god. Has he been harmed? SYDNEY: No, but Kafka's got him pretty heavily guarded. Give me the map grid numbers. I'll be there in two hours. Oh, Yusef, were you aware that a countryman of yours was found murdered back in trinity? No. That's terrible. HOSNI: Yusef, what are you doing here? I said to stay with the professor. She's found prince Shareem. I've come for support to bring him out. Once again, you disobey me. Do you think I would trust the prince's safety to you now? We leave immediately. [chattering] Get in the bag. Shh! Here, put this on. I'll take it from here. What is that? Be careful. A wax sealing scroll. More worthless junk. There are dozens at the museum in Marrakech. Patience. If the lamp was easy to find, it wouldn't have remained hidden for centuries, Would it? Yes, well, time is a luxury I haven't got. I'm going to go over my research. I suggest you do the same. Go away, Kafka. I don't want to be disturbed. It's me, Shareem. Professor Fox? Come on, we should get out of here. What are you talking about? How did you find me? Your uncle Hosni was worried about you going after the lamp. Hosni came to see you? Yes. He told me you hired Frank Kafka. Afraid I was right after all. No, Shareem. Kafka is not a man to be trusted. You find that relic, you won't live long enough to use it. What do you mean? Kafka has no intention of handing over a valuable relic not when he can get ten times the amount on the black market. You're lying. Trust me, he'll kill you and he may not be the only one that wants to kill you. A countryman of yours was found dead back on campus. Wait. First you refuse to help me, then you show up out here in the middle of nowhere. You tell me Kafka's a bad guy and I'm supposed to believe you. Now you tell me of some death? Murder. See, this is exactly why I need the light of truth. I don't know who to trust. All right, Shareem. What have you dug up here? A few double-handed amphorae, shards of decorative objects depicting Macedonian characters, a wax sealing scroll. All right, when did wax sealing scrolls fall out of vogue? Your scroll stated that a bedouin hid the lamp in the 9th century. And the objects we're finding predate that by centuries. You're a far better archaeologist than Kafka, Shareem. He's got you looking in the wrong places. Kafka's got you looking for water wells? Uh huh. In your scroll, there was a word. There. That comes from an old Persian dialect. That's the ancient word for "well". Not exactly. The literal translation is a hole in the earth. Which could also refer to caves. [whistling] Come on, Shareem. Go, go, go. Shareem! You go. We've been digging in the wrong place. Really? SYDNEY: Psst, psst. SHAREEM: The artifacts we're finding are of the wrong period. What do I pay you for if not your expertise? Strange. A few minutes ago, you were perfectly content to dig where I told you to. Suddenly, you know better. KAFKA: What's that, Oliver? Sydney Fox is here? Have you been consulting with Sydney Fox behind my back? Sydney Fox? I don't know what you mean. I've been going over the map and my research and I realized the error. I don't know why I didn't see it sooner. She's here, isn't she? Same old Sydney... Brilliant, Crafty and predictable to a "t". Sydney Fox. Show yourself or I kill your friend. Sydney, you know I'm not a patient man. Yusef's probably hours away. I'm going to count to three and then it's bye bye, pretty boy. I say we give the man what he wants. KAFKA: One... The same man who promised to kill you? KAFKA: Two... I'm open to suggestions. KAFKA: Don't make me do it. What about a diversion? Do it. Where will you be? Dancing with Kafka. Glad to see me? Of course, relic girl. I've waited a long time for this moment. So you wanted me? You owe me a hand, Sydney. The way I remember it, you got greedy. I just recovered a relic that you stole. Wrong! You stole my hand. No, that would be a quick death. I'm going to have your beautiful hands first. How does it feel, relic girl? Oh, trying to be tough girl. [gun shots] Sydney! SYDNEY: Nigel, slipping. It's Yusef! You had me worried there for a bit? I can't believe Kafka's actually dead. SHAREEM: Sydney, you were right about the translation. Some hole in the earth, huh? This is ridiculous. Shareem, you should be with your father, not chasing after yet another relic hunter. Your uncle doesn't seem too happy. He's that way out of concern. He's always supported me. When I wanted to study abroad, he made it happen, Even stood up against my father which, if you knew my father, was not an easy task. Well, he doesn't seem really supportive right now. So where is your mystical lamp, Shareem? Syd, there's something here. A bull. The statue's outside. The Assyrian symbol for kingship. NIGEL: A bull used here indicates... A path to wisdom... NIGEL: ... And knowledge... [together]... Is inside. Oh. Sorry. Sorry. Nigel, see that trigger mechanism at the back of the bull's mouth? A trap. Some sort of Assyrian guillotine. NIGEL: It looks like it's triggered by a change in pressure, but it's hard to tell. One way to find out. Finally, a good use for that. You always carry a meathook with you? Just something I picked up. That would've been too easy. The trap's reset itself. Just slight delay. You know, if one were accurate enough, something might get through. Another trap? You know, the vaulting in these tunnels reminds me of the temple crypts in Kafiristan. What? We were nearly killed in Kafiristan. Were we? Still, similar. There it is. The light of truth. You see, uncle, it does exist. I see nothing but an old lamp. I could buy a thousand like it in any marketplace. You've shown a lot of courage in finding the light of truth, Shareem. You know how to use it. Yusef, You've been by my side since childhood. A loyal guard and trusted friend. I know we don't always see eye to eye and that you harbour some misgivings about the future. But in order for our friendship to move forward from this point on, I need to know that you will always be loyal to me. I knew I could count on you, Yusef. You'll be my most trusted counsellor. Are you out of your mind? Yusef is just a bodyguard. He has no experience in affairs of state. Neither do I and yet I'm going to be king. You have what you came for. Let us be gone from here. You don't believe in the power of the lamp. What have you got to lose? Why do you let them insult me? Have you forgotten it was I who helped you go to America to study? Yes. But perhaps sending me abroad served another purpose. By having me dress in western clothes and speak in a foreign tongue, my countrymen might see me as a prince that would turn his back on his own people and their customs. Yusef, take him out of here. Yusef, that is an order. You sent the assassin, didn't you? What are you talking about? My prince, I didn't want to worry you. Your father's so sick. Someone was sent to the University to kill you. What has this to do with me? There are thousands like it, remember? What possible harm could come to you by merely holding it? All my life, I've taken orders from my brother. Now, I am expected to bow down before his worthless son? Never! No! [gun shot] Your highness. Welcome back. How did everything go with Prince Shareem? NIGEL: We found his lamp. It's now on the way back to the national museum. Yeah, he realized he didn't need it after all. These are for you. Thank you. And this is for you. Me? My apartment. Great, I... I thought I had missed it. I kind of had someone stand in for you. Well, I can't imagine who. Thank you. I'll explain later. In the meantime, when you go to pick up your key, If he calls you Sanjay or asks about the laryngitis, just tell him it was someone else. I'm not even going to ask.

I meant tongue luck. ANNOUNCER: The Winner is Number Four, Steven. I've run over black cats that were luckier than me. Get your hot horse-burgers, horse-fries, horse-cakes and shakes. -Tongue straight from the horse's mouth. -lt all sounds good. All our horses are 100%%% horse-fed for that double juiced-in goodness. I'll have a cholesterol-free omelet with horse-beaters. -How can I horse you, sir? -I'll have a horse Coke. -Horse Pepsi okay? -Neigh! [BENDER WHISTLES] [HORSE WHINNIES] [Y AWNS] [BENDER GIGGLES] -Hey! What are you doing? -This. Dear Horse God, I don't usually pray. Sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once. [BENDER GIGGLES] Come on, Number Six. Move it! Don't do that. What are you...? It's contagious. ANNOUNCER: And the Winner is Harry Trotter by the entire racetrack. Yahoo! That'll teach those horses to take drugs. That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all. I say, enough! I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding on to. Oh, no, you don't. I may not know about horses, but I know lots about doing anything for $1 . If you think bad luck can defeat me, you don't know my name is Philip J.... Phew! [CLATTERING] That is one unlucky guy. Kareem has the sky hook, but Philip J. Fry has the space hook. Yancy drives, he goes up with his patented space hook. Hey! That's my patented space hook. You stole it. You're not the president of it. Holy camolie! A seven-leaf clover. I'm dying of old age! Game over! Phil wins. Yancy's fans are stunned. There'll be no celebration at the Yancy Dome. Lucky! [BENDER WHISTLES] Someone's in a good mode. Let's say I lucked out at the track. Also I rigged one race. I'd have won too, if I still had my seven-leaf clover. Plus, I'd still have my hair. I got your page, Mr. Fry. Your new hair is ready. What happened to this clover? I hid it in a secret place and never told anyone. Not even Scruffy. -So is it still in the hiding place? -Yeah, maybe it is still there. In the ruins of Old New York. Helping one ant defeat another. -Or giving luck to a piece of dirt. -Dirt doesn't need luck. I'm going to get my clover back! Some of the tunnels have metal bars. Who's good at bending? -How about you? -Sure. -But Bending's my middle name. -lt is? Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodriguez. Here's the entrance. From this moment, I declare my bad luck officially over. [FRY SCREAMS] He was fun. If we get bored looking for the clover, I've got Tetris on this thing. FRY : Look, up ahead. BENDER: Old New York. The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas. We've got Manhattan all to ourselves. I can finally do the crazy stuff I always dreamed. Howard Stern is overrated. -Oops! -New York is so burned. -Remember Giuliani stopping jaywalking? -No. Well, Rudy, how do you like this action? The big breakdance battle is Saturday. If we wanna win Jam Master Jay's parachute pants our crew has to pop, lock and bust the freshest. Noticeably F.A.T., drop us a beat. [BEAT BOXES] -Name? -Cosmic F. -Style? -Outer space. -Special moves? -The moonwalk. The robot. The zero G. -Name? -Cosmic Y. -Style? -Deep Space. Deep Space? ! -Special moves? -The space-walk. -The robot. -That's similar to mine. The zero G. -You totally ripped off my routine. -You calling me a biter? Why do you always have to steal everything from me, Yancy? -Stop illing. Word. -I'd like to see you steal this: The septuple head-spin! He's just scratching. No one's done more than a quadruple. Oh, yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape. [MIMICS TAPE REWINDING] [BEAT BOXES] Crazy sucker. -Phil, you're hot. -That was ice-cold, bro. Fry, if I ever see you try anything that crazy again this crew might just have some new parachute pants. Stop hogging the clover. -Let's go find that clover. -Which way to your house? -The sign says we're at 71st Street. -71st Street? Never heard of it. -Downtown could be in any direction. -We'll just take a spin on the B-train. That feels funny! This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train, stopping wherever I feel like. Watch for the closing doors. [SNORES] Wake up, buddy. End of the line. My old neighborhood. That's the bench where I found shirts. We used to light that hydrant on fire! On that corner, some guy handed out a socialist newsletter. -Was it poorly xeroxed? -Oh, yeah. The comedians were right. This is different from L.A. -Did you say you used to live here? -That's right. -Did you know Andy Goldman? -He was my neighbor. Why? -I mutated from him. -What's he up to these days? I'm teaching. -He seemed nice. -Sure, when he's sober. Holy camolie! The house I grew up in, it's still there! BENDER: Man, Father Time really took a bat to this place. That stupid clover is a worthless piece of garbage. Give it! FRY : Mom, help! Yes! -Yancy's trying to steal my clover. -Yancy, stealing is wrong. I'm gonna pile drive you. You're dead meat! What's happening? Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes? Not yet, commander. Yancy's trying to steal my stuff. He better keep his hands off these bananas. Gonna need them when the radiation turns us all into monkeys. The Ronco Record Vault. Yancy will never get his hands on you in here. The Breakfast Club soundtrack. I can't wait until I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff. Stay safe, clover. I may need you again someday. My dad spent years turning this into a bomb shelter. -Yet there was no nuclear war. -What a waste. This is it. My Ronco Record Vault. I still remember the combination. Three. It's stuck. The Achilles' heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency. There we go. -Here's The Breakfast Club soundtrack. -You mean breakfast club sandwich? I hid my clover in the jacket so my brother, Yancy, wouldn't get it. Here goes. It's gone! The whole place has been cleaned out. -Yancy stole my clover. -How do you know it didn't disintegrate? -Everything else held up okay. -Except Sports, by Huey Lewis. -My brother hated me so much. -Brothers always fight. He just never got a chance to say he loved you before you got frozen. You think? Because I always kind of wished that-- -Who is that godlike figure? -lt's my brother, Yancy. And there's my seven-leaf clover. I knew he stole it. If that's Yancy, why does the inscription say Philip J. Fry? Wait a second. That's my name. Good Lord! He ditched his goofy name and stole mine. Apparently, this brave adonis, this Cadillac of men... -...was the "first person on Mars." FRY : First person on Mars? ! That should've been me! He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life. -And now he broke my hand. -His legend lives on. You opened the vault, and the clover was gone? Nothing in there but the best music of the 1980s. Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions. The list goes on. My brother stole my dream of going into space. -Now I'll never get there. -You went this morning. "First person on Mars." So your brother was that Philip J. Fry. -I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name. -Shut up, friends. My browser heard the word "Fry" and found the Philip J. Fry movie. It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered some french fries. NARRATOR: Philip J. Fry, astronaut, philanthropist, entrepreneur Was a great man, truly Worthy of narration. Fry Was the first man on Mars, a feat never equaled. It should've been me! The ever-lucky Fry made his fortune by striking oil in the mansion he had Won in a lottery. That's my clover. He stole it! After a fling With Icelandic supermodel, Njord Fry scored many hits With his band, Leaf Seven known for their hypnotic rhythms and memorable hooks. I'm known for that! Phil came and strummed out this tune, and I said that's a number-one record. NARRATOR: Fry now spends his time in a grave at Orbiting meadows Cemetery buried With his trademark clover to bring him luck in the next life. That's where my clover is. Is that cemetery near here? -lt will be in a couple of hours. -Good, we're going grave robbing. I'll get my kit. Your tux will be perfect for my wedding, Dad. Yancy, that tux got me through Nam in style. -I wish your bother could see this. -I remember the day he disappeared. Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 17-9. Oh, I miss him. I was gonna rummage through Phil's records to play at the wedding. He may be missing, but his crap sure isn't. Breakfast Club. This will clear the room after the reception. He's buried in the world heroes section? I'm impressed. I should be the one in that grave! We lost Bender. Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine. Aha! My brother's grave! "Philip Fry, the original Martian." It's all lies. He wasn't original. He wasn't a Martian. -He wasn't Philip. He wasn't a "the." -You're twice the "the" he ever was. It's clovering time. -So, had any ideas for names, Yancy? -I'm sort of thinking one. Daddy has a present for you. Know what it is? It's a lucky clover to help you be successful, even at breakdancing. It belonged to someone very special. I know what name you want to give him. It's okay. Really? Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honor of my little brother, who I miss every day. I love you, Philip. And I always will. "Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle to carry on his spirit." Pay dirt! I got the clover, plus his wedding ring. Sorry, ladies, I'm taken. Hey, Fry, you want me to smack the corpse up a little? Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone. Okay, grab a shovel. I'm one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion. [SIMPLE MINDS' "DON'T YOU (FORGET ABOUT ME)" PLA YS] Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ENGLISH SDH] Where the Buggalo Roam [DOORBELL RINGS] MR. WONG: Yes? - Hi, Dad! It's me and my coworkers. MRS. WONG: Open up, Leo. It's Amy and her weirdoes. Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars! Thanks for inviting us. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue. Mars Day better than Earth Day. Dump trash anywhere. - Big, empty planet. - Okay! Make yourselves at home. Don't mind if I already did. Do you have any more Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway. [GROWLING] Quite a large ranch you have. 17.9 billion acres. We own entire Western Hemisphere. - That the best hemisphere. - It's the same on Earth. [CLACKING] MR. WONG: Here is most number one product. The mighty Buggalo. Used for everything. Meat, milk. Their shells make rowboats. I broke your television! It must take forever to brand them. Not really. We own so much, it easier to brand everything that not ours. Please don't do that. Hey! Betsy! This is my sweet Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate my sweater. We going to eat her at Amy's wedding. If she ever get married. Dad! Gleesh! Don't say that when you meet my boyfriend. Oh, that right. We get to spend time with this Mr. Kif. I hope he's a nice man who can make grandchildren. This not a parallel universe where you get younger. Remember, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents. - Have sex with them, and you're in. - I'm nervous about meeting her family. That's natural. You're meek and uninteresting. You've gotten by on my leftover charisma. Scrounging off it, like a tiny parasite. I hope they like me. Why wouldn't they? Yes, I know. Tiny, meek, uninteresting. Spare me your tedious story, Kif. And above all, have fun! [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS] Get on down! Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn! Yo, fool! It's Mix-Master Festus. So, what's Mars Day about? It commemorate the day when our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong bought Mars from stupid natives. How can you call them stupid? They sell whole planet for one bead. Sound stupid to me. That is stupid! I can't believe you laugh at exploiting a proud, bead-loving people. Lighten up. It's funny. Of course. But you don't have to laugh! No. Not on your parents' planet. Glad to see you've come back to the country. It's where the flavor is. R.J., this is my boyfriend, Kif. This wimp? You've gone a long way, baby. - Cigarette, partner? - Oh, I don't... [COUGHS] - I haven't even lit it yet. - Oh. Is it lit now? Yep. You're pathetic. Host man. Host woman. I'm having a wonderful time! You here five hours, already you tear up couch and fill pool with shrimp! Not bad for a city boy, huh? By the way, I took the liberty of fertilizing your caviar. [BELCHES] [STAMMERS] Relax. I'm sure my parents will love you. When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage reflex. Oh, dear. Oh, goodness. Oh, odds and bodkins. - I'll have a thorax and feelers. - You want salad? Yuck! Mom? Dad? You remember Kif. - I have instant dislike of him. - Too scrawny to father grandchildren. He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned. Actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by fluid-filled bladders that... You a big, squishy wuss. Amy should date real man. Like him! I can be manly too. I think I'll light up a smoke. Wrong way. Smooth. [CHOKES] Look on the bright side. My parents left after you passed out, so they didn't see you barf. Now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter. It's okay, Kif. I'll go get you a tissue from your tote. Hey there, Amy. Like you to meet my buddy, Joe. Sorry I'm late. My pool game ran long at the jazz club. Kids love him. [HUMMING] What's that weird sound? Dust storm! Oh, dust storm! Everybody into house. Hurry before we die. And wipe your damn feet! Phew. Everyone okay? No one considering lawsuit? Mm. I might have mental anguish. - I'm friends with every judge here. - I'm okay, then. Storm dying down. Check if Buggalo herd is okay. Oh! - Where are the Buggalo? - Rustled under cover of storm! - We ruined! - No! Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be okay. Oh, really? Who gonna save us? One-eye? Lobster mooch? Drunken garbage can? - This sounds like a job for... - Lt. Kif Kroker! All right, then. Those Buggalo were what made Wong family so rich and powerful. Oh, Inez, we damn stolen! We ruined! Okay, I want a divorce. Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose! They're not your parents. I'm not your sister. And that's not your golf cart. Aw. [BEEPS] Everybody calm down. Kif promised to catch the rustlers. Mrs. Wong, could I borrow a neckerchief? [BUZZES] My plan is to take the remaining Buggalo and lead them on a tough cattle drive. When rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest. Sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry? Leela? Bender? I want you to go with him. Oh, man. Don't worry, Mr. And Mrs. Wong. I'll get your cattle back, or die trying. We can't lose! No, it's too risky! You don't have to do this to prove you're a man. Oh, yes, he does! Here are your mounts. She's got a fine coat. We need Buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left? Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit. Kif: Ooh. Oh. Aw, she likes you. Saddle up, men! We got some no-good rustlers to catch! We got a right to pick a little flight With rustlers Somebody wants to pick a flight with us He better bite my ass Yee-ha! Wow! Look at that! Olympus Mons! The tallest volcano in the solar system. - Where? - Right in front of you. FRY: Oh. Oh! We'll camp at the top. The rustlers will spot us. Where? And even though the computer was off and unplugged an image stayed on the screen. It was the Windows logo! - That's not scary! - It is if you're a printer! Okay, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving... - Hook on the hand! - Okay, I've got one. This family... Man in the attic! Mr. Know-it-all-about-something, finally! Tell a story. With pleasure. Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive. Bored robot kills Fry with a hammer! Sorry, go on. While they sat helplessly around the campfire a demented, lunatic, libertarian zombie snuck up... AMY: Surprise! Amy, what are you doing here? - I forgot to give you something. - Oh. What? Is that your camouflage reflex, or are you just happy to see me? I love it out here, Amy. I feel so manly. I have a blister, I spit, and, of course, I tell no one my feelings. - But you still have them? - Yes. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary. - Ah, it's a wonderful night. - It sure is. I could lie beside you, staring at the sky, all night. - I can't. - Ooh. [RUMBLING] - What's that? - Maybe we just made love. [CLACKING] AMY: The Buggalo are in the crater! The rustlers must have seen me and ran! - Oh, Kif. You're so brave! - Sh. They'll hear us. Okay, the dynamite's in place. There's no other way to do it? Only if your parents have thousands of helicopters. - Actually... - Too late! This is more fun! Kif, you did it! How did you know dynamite would work? I took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. The principle is essentially the same. [HUMMING] Hey, it's that "barbecue's over" sound again! LEELA: Sandstorm! [SCREAMING] - We're in the eye of the storm! - Where? [BUZZING] What's that? - Oh, my gosh! - Who are they? We are the native Martians. [GASPING] I didn't know Buggalo could fly. Those who revere Mother Mars can fly them. Only they shall have Buggalo. They're us. But your Martian-ness, these Buggalo aren't yours. They belong to the Wong family. You mean family that took all land and gave us a lousy bead? Uh-huh. Amy Wong. And you are? Mad at Wong family! We plan to ruin them by stealing Buggalo. But now we take girl instead. Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped! Amy! No! Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful rich girl will fall in love with you. Hooray! You bring back cattle! Yes. But I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well. Let Amy tell us. That way it soften the blow. Why Amy being so quiet? Well... That is... [HUMMING] MR. WONG: Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy! MR. WONG: It them. They no use good grammar. - I'll get your daughter back. - Forget it, squishy. You lose her. You done enough. This time we get most decorated lawman in the whole universe! You mean...? Oh, no, please, I beg you. For the... I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service. Please, we need you go get our daughter back! I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martians personally. - Your gasps intrigue me. - Martians have no land. They been encouraged to live on reservation underground. No one ever dare go there. This mission is very dangerous! Someone's sure to be killed! - Fry? Leela? Bender? - Damn you, old man! Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif. I didn't realize you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant. She won't leave me alone. Did I say girlfriend? She sounds more like a wife. Zapp: Behold! The stone face of Mars! FRY: Hm. - The only entrance to the reservation. - What about the great stone ass? But it's on the other side of the planet. Noseward, ho! [MUMBLING] [DOOR OPENS] I am Singing Wind. Chief of the Martian tribe. Take me to your leader. Moving along. Why you trespass on our land? To negotiate Amy Wong's release. And just to clarify, land is the stuff that has sky over it. - They have respect for the planet. - Cynthia used to drink Slurm. We'll give girl when we get planet surface. - How do we know she's alive? - I'm fine. Sh. Don't weaken our bargaining power. What if you give her up and we carve presidents in your mountain? You waste words. We want land that was taken from us. Actually, you traded it for a bead. Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse. We want land! My people are people of law. And that law is: No backsies. The time for stupid statements is over. [HUMMING] Oh, boy. Oh, oh, oh! My eye! Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch! Oof. Aiee! Ow. [SCREAMS] Amy! No! It's too windy! Kif: Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you! - Kif! You're flying Betsy! - Need a lift? Oh! Oh, oh. Great Mother Mars! He has the gift. [HUMMING STOPS] FRY: Yeah, Kif! BENDER: All right! Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism. We misjudged you, green one. You fly the Buggalo like us. You have reverence for Mother Mars. - Let there be peace between us. - Yes. Let us smoke-em peace pipe. Smoke-em? Here, take. No thanks. I'm on the peace patch. You must smoke peace pipe, peacefully. Or we'll kill you. Well, it's just really that I don't feel... Don't be a chicken. Teenagers all smoke, and they seem pretty on the ball. - Yeah! - Way to suck it! Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest! Oh, monkey trumpets! You coughed at our offer of peace, so you must die. The bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones. I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that... Ah! Oh, oh, oh my. Oh. FRY: That's the bead you traded your land for? It's a huge diamond! It must be worth a fortune! Really? [MUTTERS] Oh, chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world! If you want your land, we could trade back for it. Hm. We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership. - So we can have the diamond? - No. We do have concept of ownership. You can go. Sorry about the rustling and kidnapping. - And your sacred land? - Land, schmand! We don't want to live here. It's a dump. We'll buy new planet and act like it's sacred. Who's gonna argue? Nobody, that's who! Kif flew Betsy, rescued me, and made peace with the Martians. He too much of a wimp. Yeah. I'm sure it was all Mr. Zapp Brannigan here. Please, you give me too little credit. Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome at Rancho Zoidberg. [YELLS] Money doesn't make good people! No, sir! Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero. Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me. Well, gloviously. But if they liked you, then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything about girls? [RUMBLING] [CLACKING] "Dear diary, I just made love for the second time." Okay, we're ready. Come out, monster. Yeargh... monster hungry. Rarr-gh! Hey, it's Saturday morning. How about a little quiet, huh? Uh-oh, much uglier monster. Mmm-aah. Okay, watch the clubs. Watch it. But you are an ugly monster. That's right, nevertheless... and what are you doing? You're not helping any. Uh, that not sound like monster talk? Okay, come on. Okay, it's last call for breakfast. Me already have breakfast. Hey-hey-hey, no monster in the kitchen. All right, everybody, take five, remember where we were. Ah, cereal. Okay, I'm just gonna go hit a bucket of balls. See you later. Hey, hey, before you kick up your heels and skip to the car, let's at least pour the kids some juice, okay? All right. Oh, we're out of orange juice. Why is that in there? I put it back in to remind you that we're out of orange juice. - I'll get orange juice. - No, that's okay, Rob. No, no, it's okay, it's not a problem. Mom's fully stocked. Can I go with you? I'll be back in a second, sweetie, now eat your breakfast, okay? He's great, isn't he? Yeah, yeah he's great. He's my hero. All right. I'll see you later. You won't see the kids later. No? You found a buyer? Robert's taking them to the zoo. Oh yeah? Oh, well... - It's great. He's great. - Yeah. That's great... okay, I'll see you guys later. What? What's going on? You see the kids? Look. What? They're eating. But look. Oh yeah, it's cute when they do that, huh? What do you mean, "When they do that"? They do this? Yeah, once in a while. Why are they doing Robert's thing? I don't know. They love him. How come I never see them imitating any of my things? Which are... they're quirky without being ridiculous. Like what? You know... like the face I make when I comb my hair. And it bothers you that the children haven't taken that up? I'm just saying that if they're going to imitate somebody then they should aim higher. What... are you threatened by Robert? No. Hey, kids. Hey, guys. What do you say we stop eating like this? But that's the way Uncle Robert eats. Yeah, but what Uncle Robert didn't tell you was that's how he ruined his face. Oh, would you stop? See, look... watch... watch how Daddy eats. Mmm-mm, normal. Hmm? And if you want to do something after, do this. Mmm-mm. Go ahead, try that. Yeah, all right, that's almost... yeah... - Got it. - Oh, Robert, thanks. Yeah, I shouldn't have told Ma you were out of orange juice. She said she might start checking things around here more often. Someone should check to see if my head's in the oven more often. All right, kids, let's finish up and then who's ready for the zoo-zoo zoobalee-zoo? Yeah! Wait a minute, wait a minute, guys, instead of the zoobaleezoo, how about if Daddy takes you to the better zoobaree-zoogaree-zoo? What are you doing? No, nothing, I'm just thinking that I should take them to the zoo. But I thought you had golf. Well, my children happen to be more important than golf. What are you doing? Right now I'm eating in the normal human way and then the zoo. You... Ray, may I see you in the other room for a moment, please? Yes, and I'd like to have a word with you too, Raymond. All right, guys, just remember, straight to the mouth, okay? "You cannot win if you touch the chin." Hey, tick-tock, well, this is time away from my kids. Why are you doing this, Ray? Yeah, what are you trying to pull? Nothing, nothing. The kids have been asking to spend more time with me, that's all. You're kidding? No, I'm not kidding. - Really? - Yeah. Oh! You believe this? Ray, the kids have plans with Robert for today. Yeah, I even brought some goat food for the petting zoo. What kind of guy walks around with his own goat food? A guy who's prepared. I happen to have it leftover from last time and there's plenty if you want to go with us. Hey, what you mean "with us"? If we go the the zoo, it's you that goes with us. Is this about who's driving? No... look, why should I have to explain myself, okay? I, as the father, think that it's in their best interest to go to the stinking zoo with me today, okay? You can have the day off. Oh, it's "in their best interest," huh? Well, maybe it's in your best interest not to have me there. What does that mean? I just happen to know for a fact that they really enjoy my company. I am after all, a whole lot of fun. - They do enjoy you, Robert. - Thank you. What... you think they enjoy him more than they do me? - Not just them. - Wha...? Wait, so you're saying my kids prefer you to me. - Is that what you're saying? - Actually, you said it. If you're waiting for me to disagree, you might want to take a seat. - Oh yeah, well... why don't we ask them? - Go ahead. 'Cause I'll ask them... you don't think I'll ask them? I'll ask them right now. Ask away. You don't do that to children. Oh yeah, that's right. You're all about the children, yeah... Oh shut up. Shut up. Come on, this is stupid. This is stupid. Ray... you just go golfing. You can do something with them tomorrow. No, I want to go to the zoo. No, you don't. Just go play golf. No, you can't make me go golfing if I don't want to. You are so desperate. Oh yeah, I'm desperate. That's funny coming from you... a guy who has nothing better to do than go to the zoo Saturday with some children. Okay, okay, see what you just said? Spending the day with your children is boring to you. No, talking to you is boring to me. All right, Ray, It's all right, Debra, let it go. It all comes from fear. What? Fear of what? Fear that I might have more to offer your children than you. Oooh, right, yeah... you're... you're opening up whole new worlds to them. The world of feet that smell so bad, your nose had to grow as far away from them as possible. I just have one question. Who do we have a photo of at his children's Christmas pageant wearing headphones, huh? I think that's the same person who tried to get the postman to babysit one day. What are you... are you on his side now? Yes. What did he do... he started it. No, he just wanted to take the kids to the zoo. Well, maybe he should get his own life. No, don't listen to him, Robert. Ray, apologize. It's quite all right, Debra. As it happens, I do have my own life. A very full one. So for the sake of the children, I'll just slip out the front door and go enjoy it. I will also borrow your TV Guide. You... stare all you want. You know what you're staring at? The person that's right. Yeah, so go ahead, just keep on staring. What? Nothing. You're really on a roll today, huh? Why don't you call up your father and tell him he's mean and old and fat? Sounds like you have something you want to tell my father. I don't care how insecure you feel about what kind of father you are. What you just said to Robert was way over the line. What... look, he should get his own life. Who is he to come in here and tell me that I am bored with my own kids? Come on, kids, we're going to the zoo. Where is Uncle Robert? Um... Uncle Robert had to go do some police stuff, 'cause there was a kitten that got stuck in the tree and they need to climb up him to get it. Can we go see Uncle Robert and the kitten? No, no, no, no, 'cause you know why? 'Cause actually it's not a kitten, it's a snake. - Ray! - Yeah... Come on guys, let's get dressed, let's get dressed for the zoo, guys. Come on, come on, we're gonna go to the zoo and Daddy is gonna make his famous zoo snacks. That's your famous "zoo snack"? "Animal crackers," put it together. Who told Robert to "get a life"? Ray...? What? It could've been you. Oh, Raymond, how could you do that? Okay, first of all, you're only hearing one side of the story, okay? And you're taking it way out of context and blowing it way out of proportion. Because I will say this... the things he said to me were outrageous. Like what? - Like I am not a good father. - Oh... That's right, he said that in my own house, in front of my children... He did not say that in front of the kids. Well, they were in the next room. And Robert has that big booming voice which to children sounds like God, okay? All right? So just before you come in here and start accusing me maybe you should just look in the mirror with Robert standing next to you. You go to your brother and apologize. Yeah, I agree with you, Marie. I'll fight you both. She's right, Ray. You see, Raymond, you don't know how hurtful words could be. I don't think you have any idea how you come across to people sometimes. You do? Yes, yes. I'm very attuned to people's feelings. I would never think of saying hurtful or critical things to anybody. Isn't that right, Debra? I totally agree with you about Robert. I mean... Robert has problems, he has many problems. But, but he's a devoted brother. Devoted to bothering me. He loves you, Raymond, and your family. How could you tell him to get a life when he's trying to help you with your children? That's exactly what I said. Yeah, because what I see is... that you are at work, at a ball game, you like to play the golf... Where do you think he was going this morning? - Okay, but now I'm not. - Well let me tell you something. If it wasn't for Robert doing things with the children once in a while, they'd be sitting in front of the television set all day. But look, I'm taking them to the zoo, okay? I've got the snacks. Kids, zoo! Marie, what did you mean by "television all day"? Marie, what the hell? One second you were making me pancakes, the next second you're gone. Which would be great if there were pancakes. Didn't you hear my discussion with Robert? He's having a crisis. So is my stomach. Marie, when you said, "television all day," you don't mean all day, do you? Oh, no, no, I mean the kids also have school and sleep. But I'm with the kids most of the day and I don't sit them in front of the television. I'm only reporting what I see. But that is so not... you don't even... Hoo-hoo. What are you saying, Ray? I'm just saying, hoo-hoo. You listen to me, I do not sit those kids in front of the television all day. Once in a while, because it's very demanding to be a single parent... I might just, to get myself five minutes, put on an educational video sometimes. Seems like those educational videos have a lot of anvils dropping on people's heads. Okay, we're ready for the zoo. Not yet, kids, just go up and watch... just read a book. Look, I just think there's just a little too much criticizing of our parenting going on here today. What happened to, "I agree with you, Marie"? So are you gonna finish my pancakes or what? I'm starving. The batter is right there, Frank. You can't pour batter onto a griddle? You better hope I can't, otherwise you're on a bus to the home. I was just thinking instead of all that television, maybe you can do an art project with your children. You know, you can make a caterpillar out of an egg carton. Hey, this stuff is pretty good. Yeah, uh... Dad, those are goat pellets. Now when you say, "goat pellets..." It's food for goats, Frank. Okay then. Why don't I get you an egg carton and walk you through your first caterpillar with the children? Do you have any eggs? Because I understand that you ran out of orange juice earlier. Actually, the kids are going to the zoo today with... uh, me. With me. I'm taking the kids to the zoo today. Kids! Zoo! Oh, no, no, I said I'm taking them, okay? And I'm looking forward to it. Kids, I'm not going to tell you again, come down here. I am taking the kids to the zoo. You have to apologize to your brother, right, Marie? Robert's not going anywhere. Raymond can talk to him later. Go enjoy your children, Raymond. Thank you, thank you, Mom, come on. We can make a caterpillar. Going to the zoo. All right. Yeah, Dad, I'm gonna need those pellets, all right? Hey, while you're there, see what the sheep eat. Here, go ahead, go ahead. The bubbles tickle. Hey, you know you're right? This jet is stronger. Robert? Hey, little bro', what brings you here? Hey. No, I was just gonna come by to talk to you but... maybe it's a bad time. No, no, no, that's okay, we're just hanging. Yeah? Uh... Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry, Raymond, I would like you to meet my neighbors... this is Colleen and Lisa, this is my brother, Raymond. - Hi. - Hi, hi, yeah... I'm his brother, Raymond. So... what's up? Uh... nothing, nothing, I just... I went to the zoo today with the kids, you know... - Oh-hh. - That's cute. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, you know, I went to the zoo... And anyway, at the zoo, I-I saw these two monkeys that were picking stuff off each other, you know. And I... started to think about me and you, you know? 'Cause they looked like they could be brothers and I started to feel bad about what I said. So, all I'm saying, look, about before, you know... Hey, look, don't worry about it, Raymond. You know, after our little discussion I was actually feeling kind of down too. And then I ran into Colleen and Lisa and realized that "get your own life" wasn't such bad advice. - Glad I could help. - How was the zoo? - Yeah, did you have a good time? - Yeah, well... it turns out the twins aren't really interested in animals. But they did find a bottle cap that they thought was hilarious. Yeah... and all Ally wanted to do was see Baby Emu, but it never came out of its thing. We saw something moving around back there, but I don't know, I think it was just some dude. Oh, That's too bad. I'm sorry. Hey, why don't you join us? No, no... I don't even have a suit. Wear mine. It's over there. See what I did there? Robert, you're so funny. Yeah. - All right, so I'll see you, okay? - All right, I'll see you. But wait... what? What, Raymond? Is there something else? No, nothing, it's nothing. I was gonna ask you something... but no, I mean, you're in the middle of something here, so... - Do you want us to go? - No, no, we're fine here. It's all right, Raymond, what's on your mind? No, nothing, you know... it's just... it's about the kids. Oh, what did they do? What is it, Raymond? Well... you know what you said to me before? About... how I find being with my kids sometimes to be kind of... boring? Robert, that's a mean thing to say. I think it's true. - Oh my God. - What? ! I know, I know, I'm a bad guy, right? I mean I love my kids, I can't wait to see them when I come home, but... after five minutes... I don't know, I kind of had enough, you know. I want to watch sports or even talk to Debra. - Debra's his wife. - Lucky her. And they... they did want to go to the zoo with you today. I should have let them go, 'cause I don't know what I'm doing. Raymond, Raymond, Raymond... I understand you being bored by the kids, they're kids. Believe it or not, I myself don't find playing monster for four hours all that stimulating either. But it's not about me. I do it because they like it. Yeah. But... I get to do something that you don't. I get to leave. So it really wasn't fair of me to compare myself to you who has a full-time job and who is a full-time dad. And a damn good one. Oh... thank you, Robert. You're welcome, Raymond. Okay. All right, I'm gonna go. I'll tell the kids that you said hi. - Great. - Okay, bye. Bye. Wow, Robert, no wonder you're such a good doctor. You said, "Get a life." Okay, we're ready, come out, monster. Ah, got you! How much longer? Yah-hh! How much longer? Chase us to the castle. Can't... can't this be the castle, right here? All right, argh! Hurry, hurry, hurry. He's gonna get you! Hey, who wants to go swimming at Uncle Robert's? Elf "XUXA AND THE ELVES" Elf He comes from the forest From the inner woods From winds and roses From sung poetry From the breeze in the leaves From the world of flowers from a baby's lap From a beloved planet Elf Elf From the jungle The color of the sea Elf Elf Elf There was a time, not too long ago... when the elemental beings lived an exciting story. Elemental beings, granny? What's that? Elemental beings are sprites... who protect nature's elements. I didn't get it, granny. Fairies are guardians of the air. Nymphs, of the water... salamanders, of the fire... and elves and gnomes are the earth's guardians. Gnomes take care of minerals... and elves protect the plants. Now I've got it, granny. Zaki, my grandchild... do you believe in elves? The kingdom was celebrating! Prince Damiz... was celebrating 13 oak knots... the kind of tree that measures an elf's age. And he was getting prepared to be the future king. All right, all right, all right. Damiz, Damiz... What about your nose, my son, how is it going? It's going to be sunny! Right. You mean I know what's the weather going to be? So it seems. What about whistling? Gentlemen... thegame. Do you think I can do it, dad? To run away from the troll I need all smooth pieces. And then I pick the escape route. Think, my son, that you're in the forest... and you must run away from the troll. If you know this game well you'll learn... all the ways leading to our village in the forest. Play, my son. But willing to win. I won, dad! I beat the troll! Granny, what's a troll? It's the worst enemy of the elves. My son, I'm sure you'll be a good and fair king. As a genuine friendship elf... you should make friends... and protect our world's laws. That's your destiny. The holy talisman! Whenever you're in danger... look for a similar one. Evil can only be defeated when all powers of good get together. May the elf of light protect you, Damiz May he protect you! Mika. A flower for your thoughts. We are lucky, Zinga. Our kids are good, brave... and they shall accomplish their destiny. I know it's got to be like this, but I fear so much for them. Every one has a task in nature. The elf of light must protect us from over there... from the other world. The friendship elf must stay here... protecting its people, so that they can live on. We'll accomplish our task, Mika. No doubt about it. Zinga... what's this smell? It smells like... Troll! Run away, Damiz. -Run away! -Help! Mika, Mika! -Our son was taken away, Mika. -Zinga... Did he eat Damiz? No, no, no, Zaki. But he took little Damiz away... far away from his village. Have you found anything yet? Nothing, Jessica. It's all computers, Internet. Whenever there's something... one shouldn't be older than 35. Don't give up. I'm sure something is going to come up. Nanda, come, breakfast is served. I'm going to accept more orders for candies. No! You're working so hard, looking after home and Nanda. Besides, your candies and cakes are helping a lot. Nanda! Daddy, don't be sad. We'll help you. She's right, sweet pie. We're all going to help you. And it's going to get better. If we sold the house... Sister-in-law is waiting. She says she has... a lot to ask you. Song Yi, where are you? Ah, I'm jogging right now. Don't overdo it. I'm not, where are you? Won't you stop there! Are you with Do Min Joon? Last time in the hospital, ifI wasn'thallucinatingbecauseIhurtmyhead , Do Min Joon, you... suddenly appeared in front of me. That's right. 12 years ago, that day... youdisappearedreallyfast andwerestandingacrossthestreet. That time, also. You're right. At first, you were strange... and a dangerous person, that's what I thought. You... when you told me to protect Song Yi from my brother, I thought you had something planned. But, now I know. Why you told me those words, the accident that Song Yi had not too long ago, It seems like it was my brother's doing. I know. I think his wife is locked up in a hospital. So that I can take my sister-in-law out, help me. If I meet my sister-in-law, I will be able to know many more things. Investigate the hospital. They will probably get my sister-in-law out. Because she is someone who's not in the list of patients. Yes, I understand. Yang Min Joo is not here. I also have many things to ask you, Hyung. I got it. In any case, thanks. What is it? Who? By chance, was it the young girl who we met at the park? That girl who tried to get your number? No. Then a different girl? I told you it isn't. I have to practice on my script. Will you help me, Manager Do? I can't do acting. I'm not asking you to act. Just be my practice partner. All my managers did that for me before as well. Scene 71? Yeah. Don't go on a diet. Didn't I tell you repeatedly? I don't even want 1 gram of you to disappear. For me, you're perfect just the way you are. You're the prettiest one of all the women I know. Young kids are just noisy and bothersome. I don't need- Why are the lines like this? It's usually like that. He back hugs me. Why is the script like this? Seriously. And... you will do all these when you film? I have to. There's no way around it. Ah then, should we try practicing? Try doing what? Then next dialogue. You aren't going to do it? Let's stop. Why? Where are you going? Let's go together. I'm staying right beside you all day long... Did you get tired of me? Itismy noona'sfirsttime actuallydating. Soshereallydoesn'tknowanything. Me being like this is, like I said, for the sake of me trying to become tired of you as quickly as possible. Once we know everything about each other, then the fantasies about each other will be gone. It's not like I've dated only once or twice. It's obvious what goes on between a man and a woman, no? Even when father left us, I heard that Nuna was the one who had a harder time compared to Mom. She has a lot of regrets and a lot of affection. Thatkindof style. She likes puppies so much, but she doesn't have one. Why? Because something might happen to it. Because she is afraid of that. I've done my share of playing in the past. So I won't be saying boring things like "love should be like this" and "I regret that." Although I may not look like it, I am a very logical and tidy person. Do Min Joon! Do Min Joon! Do Min Joon! Do Min Joon! Do Min Joon! Do Min Joon! Do Min Joon! Why are you calling me like that? Where did you go? I went out for a walk because I felt stuffy. I was scared. I thought you left. Where will I go? I feel like you're just going to leave. What I am saying is if you leave, you will leave, but I am worried that you will leave without telling me or saying goodbye. I know I'm logical and all that but... if you go without saying bye, I won't go. I won't leave you and go. I will stay here. What are you saying? I said I won't go. Even after one month or two months. So, don't be worried. Is it okay for you not to go? What is more important is... if I don't return this time, the probability that I'll disappear will increase. I will probably die. It is okay. Is it really okay? ♫ You are my destiny. You are. You are my destiny. You are. ♫ ♫ You are my everything.

Subtitles brought to you by the Go Go Alien and Hallyu Star Team @Viki. Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."... Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program. - Mike Peterson's alive. - They did something to him. GH-325... Agent Coulson was injected with that, and literally minutes later, his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration. Fury went to dangerous lengths to keep this under wraps. We can't share this with anyone, for their safety and ours. Encrypted line secure. Agent Melinda May. Update log 93. Coulson knows. 1x16 - "End of the Beginning" Agent John Garrett, confirmed. Agent Antoine Triplett, confirmed. Well, it's no four seasons. Well, as safe houses go, it's not bad. - Phuket didn't even have mattresses. - Yeah, but Cairo had thousand-thread-count sheets, with that sateen finish. Hey, be careful what you get used to. Dig out that sat phone and get Coulson on the line. I want to run down through the list of potential candidates with him. You really think the Clairvoyant was on the index? Rejected off the index. Possibly. Just hope it's not the amazing Kreskin. I used to love that guy. - Who? - Area 3, breach. - Aah! - Hit him with an icer! What the hell? He's not going down! synccorrectionbyf1nc0 web dl sync snarry You realize, Agent Coulson, they have these things - called teleconferences now. - Nice to see you, too, Agent Hand. Thank you all for coming on such short notice. A little unconventional meeting this way, isn't it? Oh, from the reports I've read, "unconventional" seems to be Coulson's middle name these days. Fight breaks out, let me take Blake. He's coy but scrappy. I'll explain everything as soon as we hit 50,000 feet. This way. Cruising altitude reached, bearing 90 degrees just over the North pole. - Thank you. - Apologies for the song and dance, but we brought you here as a precaution. - A precaution against what? - The Clairvoyant. If there is someone out there who can read minds, at least up here, we're as far away from him as possible. Figure maybe the Northern lights will knock a few bars off his psychic wi-fi. Coulson, you know S.H.I.E.L.D.'s stance on psychics... they don't exist. - Are you suddenly a believer? - Not definitively. But I had a recent experience with an Asgardian who could bend people's will with her voice. Forced me to open my mind, so to speak. All we know for sure is the Clairvoyant's been a step ahead of us, stealing plays from our playbook. And it's pissing me off. I take it you've all read Agent Garrett's latest report. The hit on the safe house. Mr. Peterson's alive and kicking. - We call him Deathlok. - It was the project's code name. Agent Garrett and I have been tracking him the last few weeks. And we think the Clairvoyant's super-soldier bodyguard came after us for a reason. - We're getting close. - To what? His identity? We've narrowed the list to 13 candidates. Narrowed it how? From what? Agent Garrett has been taking a second look at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s gifted index, specifically the rejects. Individuals S.H.I.E.L.D. interviewed who are believed to have psychic abilities but were ultimately dismissed. So you think we've encountered the Clairvoyant before. Think how many cases we've encountered across the globe, how many cases we vetted. - It's more than possible. It's probable. - I need more coffee. Let's assume what you're saying is possible. What then? If we're going up against an actual Clairvoyant, how do you suggest we combat that? By compartmentalizing the information. A member of my team is an expert at pattern recognition and analysis... finding needles in haystacks. She'll prioritize the candidates on Garrett's list, locate them, then pair us off into random teams. That way, only one person knows the full scope of the mission. You do understand that this person you're referring to... she'd need to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent to be granted that level of access. I'm glad you brought that up. Guys, I swear, I am fine. How much blood are you gonna draw before you believe me? Your recovery... it's honestly quite unbelievable. - Strange. - We know Coulson had a very different recovery experience, so we understand why he's hesitant - about sharing our findings with others. - Yeah, but something like this drug... it needs to be studied. Has the potential to save so many lives. We'd like to send a blood sample of yours to some colleagues to do a molecular breakdown. Maybe if you spoke to Agent Coulson... Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea. If Coulson thinks it's important that this stays between us, then we should trust him. Right? He's the boss. So you're saying we should obey the rules. Who are you, and what have you done with Skye? Skye, upstairs. Top brass wants to see you. Pairing off makes total sense. Just one thought, though... - what if we make it a double-blind? - How so? Well, I'll give one person from each team the potential Clairvoyant's coordinates, and I'll give the other one the identity. That way, no one person knows the full specs of the op until you get there. I like how you think. I like how she thinks. One question... how am I supposed to access all the classified files without someone in the room? - I don't have clearance. - Now you do. Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D., Skye. I told them to come up. I... I... I don't know what to say. - Thank you. - Don't thank me. You've passed every required S.H.I.E.L.D. - exam with flying colors. - For a level 1 agent. You've assisted us on multiple field missions, put your life on the line. You earned this. Hell... you took two in the gut. More than Sitwell here's ever done. Okay, everyone. Back to work. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - Congratulations, Skye. Awesome! - Congratulations. Couldn't have done it without a great and very patient S.O. Yeah, you could have. I'm no Clairvoyant, but I do believe some things are meant to be. Don't say I never gave you anything. They're coming for me. It's time we finally meet. Can't say I'm a fan... of this double-blind situation. How will the field teams meet us at the destinations? They won't. They'll be on standby. We can't risk the Clairvoyant knowing we're coming. What you're saying is, one of these teams could be heading straight into an ambush without backup. Agent Sitwell, I just received word from the Triskelion. You have orders to report to the Lemurian Star immediately. So I assume you'll take his place. In your hunt for Santa Claus? No. I'm taking a transport jet back to the Hub where I can quarterback the field teams via satellite. Someone's gonna have to pull your asses out of the fire when things go South. I'll be in touch. I guess I got a boat to catch. - Good luck, Agent Coulson. - You, too, Agent Sitwell. Okay, on this phone, you will find a set of coordinates that'll lead you to one of the three potential Clairvoyants I've chosen. When you're within a mile, your partner will be granted access to the candidate's name and profile on their own phone. - Make sense? - You know, we haven't officially met. - John Garrett. - I guess lying unconscious in a gurney... really should not count. How are you feeling? A lot better, actually. I've been shot a couple times myself... back, shoulder. Had my throat cut once. But you know the toughest one? Thing about a third-degree burn... the burn itself doesn't hurt at all. Crazy, right? The nerve endings get all fried. But the area around the burn? That smarts. Still, gut shot's the worst. Sir, I know what you did for me, how you risked your life to save me. - So thank you. - You've got a good team around you. I just jumped on the bandwagon. Well, you trained one of them, sir. Guess it all comes full circle. Ward's your S.O., I was his. Turn, turn, turn. But this S.O. thing goes both ways. You've had a big impact on him. He's different than I remember him. - Different how? - Well, the tough thing about being a specialist is being alone. A team gives you a whole new perspective. Guess it's the difference between fighting against something and fighting for something. Or someone. Ward's got that now. Thanks for this. And, Skye, lose the "sir." I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, just like you. What's this? Um, say you need to tag a fleeing vehicle... or a wild monkey, if it was to get away from you. These rounds are built with a micro-receiver, which enables you to track your target via satellite. I've condensed all the blood-sample results into an encrypted file. Now if we just had access to... Jemma, we have a visitor. Oh. May. Hello. I assume you're talking about Skye's blood. There's just so much we don't know. - The GH-325. - 325. I mean, we don't know what drug it is, where it came from. Yeah, not to mention any potential side effects, - short-or long-term. - We're just worried about Skye. - And Agent Coulson, of course. - Have either of them exhibited any side effects or strange behavior? - "Strange" is such a subjective term. - No more than usual. Because if they have, or if they do in the future, feel free to contact me first. I can help. Okay? Okay. You're all set. Hope you paired me with someone good... or interesting, at least. Stop worrying. You wear your heart on your sleeve. And your face. I trust your judgment. The way you see the world... it's different than the rest of us. That's why I want you to dig deeper into these. The candidates' psych evaluations? The Clairvoyant thinks he can read our minds. See if you can read his. We need some insight into who this person really is, a weakness. So, do what you do... find the exploit. And stop worrying. So, Garrett says your family's like the cable version of the Kennedys. I doubt he said that. Fine. I did my own research. Had to, following in golden boy's footsteps. - There a point to this? - Just trying to keep things light. 'Cause that's what we all need right now. - You know, maybe it is. - You want to keep it light? The Clairvoyant almost killed Skye. Yeah? Well, he did kill my partner... Dan Monroe. Great guy. Had a son. You know what it's like telling a 6-year-old that his dad isn't coming home? So, we find the Clairvoyant, you might want to stay out of my way. We all got axes to grind. But we're here to take him in, not out. Ask yourself something, Agent Ward... if Skye hadn't made it, what would you be thinking right now? Elijah Fordham, 32, military background. Here. Serving 18 life sentences for a killing spree in the '90s. Sounds more psycho than psychic. You a scorpio? I was just wondering why our newest agent paired the two of us together. Must have thought we were compatible in some way. - It was random, Blake. - You seem like a scorpio. You don't believe in the Clairvoyant, but you believe in astrology. I have some theories of my own. Please tell me we're here for one of the doctors. So, I dropped down through the skylight, used up my whole mag, and hit the final guy right in the chest with a flare gun. Boy, you should have seen the look on his face when that thing went off. What? I already told you that one? - I was there. - For which part? - The whole thing. - Really? Damn, I must be getting old. Either that or I drank a lot more in my 30s than I remember. Or both. And you didn't go through the skylight. I know, but it makes for a better story. File came in. Noriko Sato, 19, junior at ball state. The co-ed... I remember. She's got an I.Q. over 200. Ran circles around every agent we sent in to interrogate her. We had no indication she was gifted. - Family's got ties to the Yakuza, though. - Heads up. - Detour. - Imagine that. Thomas Nash. Injured in a head-on collision. He's been catatonic for the past four years. Great. We're here for a vegetable. I'll find the director's office. - You get a room number on Nash. - Yes, ma'am. Nobody home. Odd. Oh. Convenient timing. Think this'll make a good story someday? One behind us. You better hope so. Mr. Peterson... stop. You have a son... Ace. He needs you. We can still help you, Mike. Mike Peterson's dead. May to Hub... Deathlok's here! Blake's down! All backup teams... move in. We have an agent down. Repeat, Agent Blake is down. Lucky the med team got to him when they did. I wouldn't call anyone in critical condition lucky. Deathlok's more dangerous than we thought. Blake fired six shots... didn't seem to faze him. - Any word on Thomas Nash? - No, he's a ghost. The facility has him listed as a resident, - but it's all a cover-up. - Nash is probably off fishing in Bora Bora right now, laughing at us. And yet Mr. Peterson was waiting for you and Blake at the facility. Why? Probably the same reason he came after Garrett... we're getting too close. He's trying to take us out. This shouldn't have happened. Backup should have been there alongside Agents Blake and May. - Clairvoyant would have seen us coming. - It appears he did anyway. The plan was flawed from the start. Come on, Vic. The plan was solid. We have an agent down because we weren't prepared. Blake knew the risks. And don't call me "Vic." - It's condescending. - Any one of us could have been ambushed. The point is, Blake's alive, and we have a suspect... Thomas Nash. I'm headed inside to prep the field teams. Agent Coulson, when can I expect Agent Simmons for debrief? She's getting ready as we speak. Good. If I'm gonna put any more agents in danger, I want them to know exactly what Deathlok is and what he's capable of. Honestly, I don't know how much more you can tell them. Who knows what else they've done to the man? Or how much man is left at all. Regardless, S.H.I.E.L.D. sees us as the resident experts on the Deathlok program. If they want me to stay here at the Hub, then that's that. Well, don't you seem awfully chipper to pick up and leave me by my lonesome. - Do I? - Yes. No wonder. Could it be because the Hub's lab facilities are much more comprehensive than ours? In case I'd like to run a molecular breakdown of Skye's blood? Yes. Brilliant deduction, Dr. Watson. I've always pictured you as Watson. Either way, if you're gonna do this, you're gonna need my help. At some point, one way or another, eventually. Well, I wouldn't go that far. I'll jerry up an encrypted hard line so we can stay in touch. Don't want the rest of the bus overhearing what we're saying. - You ready to go? - Agent Triplett. Are you staying at the Hub, as well? Yes, Garrett's keeping me here. Help brief the teams on our most recent run-in with the cyber soldier. - Don't mind the company, do you? - No, not at all. According to index archives, Nash has been on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar for about six years. Originally a bond trader in Canada doing very well for himself. Then the Canadian government recruited him to a secret department H-type program. They were looking for people with psychic abilities. Specifically people who could control human behavior, and Nash claimed he had a gift. - Claimed? - According to records, he couldn't affect a person's behavior. But he could, on occasion, predict it. But S.H.I.E.L.D. crossed him off the index after his accident because of his supposed catatonic state. Which he recovered from quite nicely. It was all a lie... just to throw S.H.I.E.L.D. off his scent. You said Blake fired how many rounds? I heard six. Why? Because there are only five missing from this magazine. And one from here. - These are Fitz's tag rounds. - We can track him. Skye, check all the sat feeds. Find that signal. - On it. - I'll get us in the air. Nicely done, Blake. I want this perimeter sealed. Two-man teams on every exit. Fitz, you got a signal? 94%, sir. Deathlok must be inside somewhere. - Possible civilians inside? - Highly doubtful. This racetrack's been shut down for months. Move out! Skye, run a back end from the tactical van. You, I want you 6 feet from Skye at all times, weapons hot. - Ward, it's okay. I'm ready. - Ward's right. I feel bad enough you're already back in the field. I'm not taking any chances with your safety. This isn't a surprise party, people, so you can toss stealth out the window. Our target's wearing body armor and has enhanced cybernetics. Make your shots count. Let's move. - You ringing the bell or knocking? - Knocking, of course. Clear! Fitz, you're up. It's time to hunt, boys. Let's find us a Deathlok. Impressive toy. I prefer the term "high-tech hardware." - Skye, you online? - Hang on. Northwest corridor is getting something. I'm pulling up a live feed. I can't confirm it's him. Initiating multi-spectrum overlay. - What the hell did they do to him? - What are you seeing? It's not just his leg or his eye. They did stuff to him. It's all under his skin. Signal's dead. Retriever's down. - He knows we're here. - Fitz, get back to the van now. Contact! Take cover! - Ward, are you okay? - I got two men down. - We need a med team! - Requesting one now. May, he's coming your way. Got him! He just ducked into the Southwest stairwell. In pursuit. All teams... he's headed into the sub-basement. I do not have a visual. - Fitz, you have a retriever down here? - On their way. Easy. - I come in peace. - How about a signal next time? Fitz, you getting this? Barely, sir. It leads down into the sewer system. That's under at least... 40 feet of concrete? We'll be blind down there. Where's that little guy going? - Sir, there's someone else down there. - Copy that. What the hell? Agent Coulson, Agent Garrett, I surrender. Forgive me if we don't shake hands. I don't like to be touched. Sir, we've got a lot of wires back here. Don't touch anything. We need this room swept for explosives. There are no traps here, Agent Coulson. You're here because we are destined to meet. You're the Clairvoyant? I'm Thomas Nash. Mr. Po gave me that other name. A bit dramatic for my taste. Eyes open, everybody. We don't know where Deathlok is or who else is down here. Mr. Peterson is gone. I cut his feed, so you won't find him. But you had him lead us here. Why? So I could see you with my own eyes instead of his. Now I understand why I couldn't see you after you died... because you, yourself, could not see. You were simply a broken man who did not know he was broken. You're one to talk. Let's pack this freak off to the fridge where he belongs. Agent Garrett, look at me. Do you believe you can confine me any more than this chair? Can somebody please tell me how we turn that stupid voice thing off? I will join Raina in your prison, Agent Coulson, but I will see you wherever you go, just as I saw you holding Skye in your arms, bleeding... dying... knowing it was all your fault. You're going away. We're gonna stick you in a little box where no one will ever hear you again. I see you're angry. Head clouded with lies. You've been betrayed, and now you fear what's about to happen. Nothing's about to happen. Just more empty threats from you. No. It is the inevitable. A force beyond your comprehension is coming for you... you and Skye. She has something we want. And she will die giving it to us. I have seen it. Go to hell. No matter where I go or what you do to me, I will always... What did you do? - Wait. What just happened? - Did Ward just... Oh, my lord. I can't believe it. Bet the Clairvoyant didn't see that coming. He's dead. It's over. He's a specialist. Cold blood's a basic requirement. So, talk it out. Thank you. Katherine Fugate was the one who kind of labeled us - the tribe. - The tribe. This core group that was so, I thought, brilliantly established on the pilot... how all of these people from different walks of life. Delaney: 'Cause we all didn't know each other in the beginning. It's kind of like a village. We came together like a village, helping each other. Yeah, yeah. But the pilot was called "A tribe is born". Whew. What is it? I think it's the scones. - [ Groans ] - Okay. Your water broke, baby. Yeah, do you think? Brown: The privates' wives and generals' wives or colonels' wives at the time wouldn't just come together. But it was a really cool premises, - like, forced these people... - Under the circumstances. - ...to communicate and to work together. - Yeah. Roland! Roxy: We need a ride. Brown: I had a nice SUV. I was able to accommodate everybody. No, I'm just saying. Did you keep that SUV? I don't remember it in later episodes. Oh, the Burton mobile is there through the end. - Yeah. - Through the end. Don't forget. I remember I screamed and got to say almost a full swear word. Oh, mother... [ Horn blares ] - That was crazy. - Screaming in pain. She's about to crown. We are not gonna make it to St. Luke's. - The tribe was born in that car. - Yes. I can't have these babies in the back seat of a car. I am not 15 and working at a dairy queen. Roxy: - Everybody out. Claudia Joy: - Let's get her out. Come on. Brown: That pilot was pretty smooth, I mean, given the fact that we have people delivering babies on pool tables and everything else. [ Baby cries ] - Do you guys remember that pool table? - I do. - Oh, yeah. Do you remember those rubber little babies in all the goo? That was good times. You having a good time? [ Chuckles ] Let's just say childbirth is as disgusting as it is miraculous. Vodka and a hammer. - Vodka and a hammer. - [ Laughs ] Vodka and a hammer! I need vodka and a hammer. Got it. Got it, got it. Brannagh: This is why you sign up to be an actress. You sign up to be able to scream at the top of your lungs. [ Groans ] [ Baby cries ] Childbirth on camera, a pool table, like, with really extreme circumstances... that's a given. We were in debt. I'm a surrogate. Please don't tell anyone. We all have our secrets. Yes, we do. Pressman: I feel like our viewers really loved the tribe despite everything that every character went through, we still came back and had this, like, core tribe group, which, I think, is so nice. [ Chuckles ] Serpico: I just knew in my bones that it was gonna be... a great experience. McNamara: You never know if a show's gonna get picked up. But we did know we were telling really good stories. When the show first aired, I thought people were going to watch it for the entertainment value. And then I started traveling and meeting military spouses, and they told me what the show meant to them. It was at that point that I realized "Army Wives" was more than just a TV show and it was more than just entertainment. "Army Wives" really taught me how to be an army wife. I believe that it reflected our lifestyle very accurately and addressed many of the issues that are facing us. There's not one episode that I go through, practically, without crying because it hits home in one area or another. Even though I'm a Marine wife, I love my army sisters, too. And I was so excited to have this focus on our families. I must have gone through three episodes when I thought, "You know, I need to have my husband watch this with me so he understands what I'm going through, as well." I got to have, like, some sense of... comfort knowing that somebody knew what I was going through. It's not an easy job. And I'm just glad that it's recognized as a job because I don't just stay home and... watch TV and, you know, eat chocolates. [ Voice breaking ] It a lot of work. I can't begin to imagine, you know, somebody being gone a year, two years, and being a single parent. How do people do this when one parent is gone? How they deal with being that single parent and all those kids is they're together. - They truly are a tribe. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. It's a real fear for soldiers, being forgotten by their children. Well, then why are they all gung-ho to leave in the first place? It's the military, sweetheart. Army, unit, family in that order. My favorite character is Roxy. We also got married very quickly, and I had to adapt just as she did... so quickly... to the military life. I love Roxy because she's opinionated, she's strong, she's sassy... she's like me. [ Rock music plays ] Oh! I remember I got the script and I was like, "Wait." You want me to read for what part?" I ain't in the mood for a game of grab-ass, cowboy. It was just, like, so entirely different from me and who I was. Roxy Leblanc was one of the more original characters that I had seen in a long time. And it was a wonderful marriage of actress and material. - She got it. Roxy: - I'd like an application. What's a big hot hooter? Roxy started out as this little spitfire from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. 1 ounce Tequila, 3/4 ounce amaretto. Fill it up with pineapple juice. And she's got two kids from two separate guys. Don't forget your cherry on top. She is completely swept off her feet by this wide-eyed dreamer, Trevor. Trevor: I know I only met you four days ago, but I've decided I want you to marry me. And just like that, she is brought into the world of the military. Trevor: This is it, baby. This is our new home. Whoo! Fuller: Trevor was convinced from the moment he met her that that was his soulmate. This was his girl, and he was gonna do everything he possibly could to, like, get her and keep her in his life. - This is more than we have ever had, okay? - Yeah. The first obvious challenge was just adapting to army life for her. I'm the new girl around here, and I was wondering if you could tell me who I have to... Who I have to get busy with around here to see a doctor. That's what Trevor loved about her, too. She was just kind of loud and spunky and just didn't know protocol, and it didn't really matter to her. At ease. Both of you. I wasn't supposed to do that, was I? No, ma'am. Melvoin: You want her to win, and you know she's gonna make mistakes, but she's gonna make it, and she's gonna do it with humor and with guts and with her own unique spin. How did you do all of this? Staple gun. It was so much fun to play Roxy with those little phrases. Girl nearly stripped her clutch when she saw me. I'm so attracted to him, I ovulate like a slot machine. Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining. You just make them up as you do, don't you? They're pretty golden. The dress code, that was a big thing for Roxy. They're gonna be talking about my outfit for weeks, aren't they? I would just look at the, like, rack of clothes for Roxy and I'd be like, "Oh, my God, this girl!" The patterns and the colors and the midriff showing. This is, like, clothes for Barbie, like Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Barbie. Roxy, where'd you get that shirt? My sponsor, Harry's Wholesale Fish. Ain't it a kick? That's Roxy. She was never trying to be anything else, and she was always true to herself. We got married at city hall. We never had a chance to say our vows. Fuller: I don't think Trevor batted an eye when the person he fell in love with had two kids. It's like, doesn't matter. "I'll adopt them immediately." He really wanted a family, to be a dad, to show these kids tradition and honor and principles. So, be brave for me, okay? Take care of your mom. [ Sighs ] Trevor and Roxy having their own kids together, the build-up was so big. Roxy: When this new baby comes, there's gonna be just so much more love in this house. You mean like when we got lucky? [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Like when we got lucky. And then to have the miscarriage, I mean, heartbreaking doesn't even begin to describe it. Well, these things happen, right? But it never happened to me. The great resolution of that is that Roxy and Trevor did eventually have kids. And not only did they have their own child, they had twins. Don't pick them up, please. They're being good. I wasn't gonna pick them up. Really? You weren't? Okay, maybe I was. [ Chuckles ] _ I think collectively, we got along really well. We had a great crew and stuff. But the weird thing was our married couples had a unique kind of vibe, each of them. Whereas you guys were like the real couple, we were like the brother/sister. We would be, like, doing some, like, super-touchy-feely scene and they would yell "Cut," and it would be like, "Ow! - Ow! Ow!" - [ Laughter ] We were always fighting. I think we got very, very lucky at the beginning, too. - Mm-hmm. - You know? To just sort of look at each other and go... - This works. - "I can do this." - Yeah. This works. - [ Chuckles ] Brian used to always say, "I'm having a great day. I get to kiss Kim Delaney today." [ Laughs ] Michael: Claudia Joy Holden, after 17 years of marriage, my heart still skips a beat every time I look at you. Michael James Holden, after 17 years of marriage, I can't believe that tired, old line of yours still works. I think what made Claudia Joy so attractive was that she was a strong leader, at the same time, a devoted wife and mother. And she showed how she could handle all of those roles. I know how hard this is getting for all of you. None of this is easy, but we have to remain strong for our troops. I think she was a good woman, you know, with her flaws, but a good mother, good wife. I would never marry a soldier. Amanda, you don't choose who you love. It just happens. Kim brought a sense of competence, of intelligence, of compassion. - How do you do it? - Do what? Organize everything and still manage to look so damn beautiful? - Michael. - I mean it. There's no way I could do my job without you. Michael and Claudia Joy were so solid with each other. It was just really wonderful. I don't think I've ever fooled around with a two-star general. Really? Have anyone in mind? You'll do. Claudia Joy is written as an incredibly smart, savvy woman. She knows how to get things done. She knows how to influence him in a very good way. They're saying Peter Belgrad didn't die in the line of duty. I just met his widow. She's gonna lose all her benefits all because you, Michael Holden, have decided her husband doesn't deserve a military funeral. She was toe-to-toe with him, eye-to-eye. If she didn't like something, she called him on it. Please, give his family that closure. I made a decision. I will not go back on it. And they withstand those arguments, you know? It always made them better. You have to let me win this one. Delaney: I think it was like a perfect marriage, like people that really love each other, put up with each other, and support each other no matter what. Woman: Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have loved ones lost or injured in this tragedy. What we know right now is there are four deaths. There were army dependents there, as well. Amanda's gone, isn't she? [ Sobs ] Oh. Delaney: The loss of a child, that's devastating. [ Sobbing ] I'll tear up now just remembering it. It was very, very hard. Claudia Joy: Why are we trying to be strong? At the end of the day, what does strong get you? I think a lot of families have a heard time surviving the death of a child. And a lot of that, I think, is because in their grief, they turn inward and away from each other. And at the beginning of season two, that started. They said that you had a panic attack. I didn't have a panic attack, Michael. - My daughter just died. - Our daughter. And I know that because I was standing there. [ Voice breaking ] I stood there by her bed, and I watched our little girl die, and there wasn't a damn thing I could do about it! Emmalin: [ Crying ] Stop it! Stop fighting. That could break up a marriage, but they found a way through it and they found a way back to each other. Feels good having people over. It's not a cure, but it helps. Melvoin: The challenge with Claudia Joy throughout was when you have a character who's so competent and so grounded is, where do you find the conflict? For example, the diabetes came out of the idea that how would she deal with this when she's so used to being in control of herself, and here's something that she can't control. [ Groans ] Denise: When are you gonna tell people? I'm not telling anyone. I appreciate your concern, but you're not my doctor. No. I'm just your best friend, and I'm a registered nurse. And I'm telling you that this is a mistake. This is my problem, Denise. I'll handle it my way. Claudia Joy had a tough road... Diabetes, kidney. Doctor: You're in complete kidney failure. When you get your strength back, we'll go over the transplant process in detail. They were great, great things for Kim to play, and she played them superbly. But, boy, she had a lot thrown at her. I adjusted to diabetes. I'll adjust to this. You amaze me. You know that? Go do your job. It's always hard for people to understand our lifestyle and the waiting game that we play. And the show "Army Wives" displays that perfectly. There's a lot of unspoken rules about being a military wife... the protocol, the things that you need to do, the things you're expected to do and expected not to do. It was the only show I've ever seen that really showed the military life. They did it right. _ It is an honor to witness these brave warriors reaffirming their commitment to serve our country. There was so much focus on portraying the military and the military spouses correctly. We had a military advisor on set making sure that all of those details were right. Considering that there was so many details the first year that we struggled with. - Our jiffy pop popcorn hats. - Those hats. [ Laughter ] We heard about that at Fort Bragg. Melvoin: I think it's really important to try to get those details right in order to convey to those people who are in the know that we did our homework. On behalf of all of us, for the small mistakes that we made, I ask the military people who've seen it to forgive us. But we were trying, you know? And trying to serve the bigger truth. All the way. All: Airborne, sir! [ Applause ] I worked with the writers and the producers, and I really saw my role as making sure that the show had an authentic feel to it. Hut and hoo! I got comments from service personnel all the time about how much they respected that we respected their service and the decorum within the military. Biank: It became the army show in a lot of ways. The army, as an institution, by the end of the series had embraced the show. It's pretty amazing. Roland: Excuse me. Someone called about my wife? Good to see you again. She's back there. Brown: I played Dr. Roland Burton. He's a psychiatrist who specializes in post-traumatic stress. Joan: What I did over there, if you knew, you wouldn't love me. I don't care what you did. I know who you are. Melvoin: Roland was a wonderful original character. And I think sterling did an amazing job. From the beginning, he made it plausible that he could have this role with these women and not, in any way, feel his masculinity threatened. Okay, ladies. Who wants to go first. He brought to that group a sense of being perhaps the big brother everybody wanted. - Thank you very much. - No problem. I like the way you drive. I knew we needed more guys here. I am so impressed by Roland and his lack of ego. And his desire to see his wife succeed to be a woman of color in a male-dominated world, I think gives him a tremendous amount of pride. I particularly would like to thank my husband, Dr. Roland Burton. He has sacrificed beyond measure to help me reach this day. He knew that when he married his wife, that he was going to be making certain sacrifices for the army. But I don't think anybody ever knows exactly what they're signing up for. I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes, and I reach for my rifle. And I'm pissed. I'm pissed off because my beautiful husband is there in my bed next to me instead of my M4. I don't know how to change that. She's come back with very strong post-traumatic stress, and they're not connecting with one another at all. I don't know what happened to you over there, but it's changed you. And if you let it control you, it's gonna destroy our marriage. Do you understand? Do you understand? ! She goes to get some help. And in the midst of her going to get this help, temptation arrives. He sees a beautiful young woman who takes a great interest in him. [ Gasping ] The audience reaction was, they're so heartbroken. There are women who would accost me on the street and would say, "How did you do that to Joan? !" Joan: Let's just call this what it is. It's not a separation. It's a divorce. What I'm most proud of is that they decided collectively to work through their marriage. So, where are we in all this, Joan? What do you want? I want you. Davis: Their marriage was not an easy marriage. And I think sometimes she had a tough time transitioning from being Joan the leader, the colonel, to Joan the wife. This is gonna sound selfish, but, Roland, I'm on the fast track right now, and I don't want to lose that momentum. You act as if a baby will be detriment to your career. A baby is just someone else on your team. Roland loved the idea of being at home with his family... his daughter, Sara Elizabeth, and then later, his son, David. There was nothing that made him happier than to raise these children. The first little girl who played Sara Elizabeth, her name was Asia. Beautiful, wonderful little child, and she could not stand the sight of me. The scene that we were shooting where Joan went to feed the baby, the baby wouldn't take food from Wendy. The baby would not do anything for Wendy. [ Baby crying ] It's okay. It really hurt my feelings. [ Laughs ] It was hard to work with her knowing that this kid isn't acting. She really just hates my guts. [ Laughs ] Roland: What exactly did Dr. Lang say? Did she advise you not to get pregnant? She said ultimately the choice was mine. Ours. Joan and Roland chose not to have another child because it would possibly endanger her life. So Roland said, "Let's not risk it. Let's adopt." Here we are. Home at last. Roland: Want to see your room? Come on. What I loved about the storyline was that this kid didn't automatically take to the Burtons. Good night, David. He really questioned if this was his forever home. - People always give me back. - Not anymore. You're our son, and we love you. I love you. I love that we told that story. You want to play Patty cake? Ready? Patty cake, Patty cake, Baker's man. Brown: I had somebody tell me once how rare it is to see a professional black man with a thriving career who is the primary caretaker of his children and excels in that arena of his life, as well as his professional career. Can I go to my room now? I don't know. Can you? May I go to my room now? Yes, you may. Charleston, South Carolina, heaven on Earth. I fell in love with Charleston the moment we got there. Serpico: The quality of life is wonderful. The people are very kind. Charleston was one of several locations that was considered. It ended up being ideal for a number of reasons. There was the fact that within 20 minutes of our main stages, you could have a selection of terrain ranging from the waterfront to a rock quarry that served as Afghanistan or parts of Iraq, even. And then there's just something about Charleston. The people are great, the town is wonderful, it has an atmosphere that's unique, and I think it made everybody feel at home. If this show shot in Los Angeles... We probably would not have been so close. You wrap, everyone goes to their life, their wives, their husbands. Because we were in Charleston, South Carolina... - Deployed. - Yeah, we were deployed. And we were our support group. We needed to be that family unit. We've got plenty of food... some pulled pork, chicken, corn on the cob. Grab a plate, dude. We'd have dinners together, we'd have barbecues together, we'd have movie night. So it made everybody closer... not just the cast. The crew, the producers, everybody joined in. It was a big family. And then, also, in terms of the foodies, some of the best eating that you can ever do. I told you. All the good food comes from Charleston. You're making a believer out of me. I'm just gonna admit it on camera. I was called at the end of season one by Lifetime. "Brian, we love your work, really, just such good work. Could you, um, watch what you eat?" - No! - Oh, yeah. Brown: My moms would even say, "Oh, McNamara. How's he doing?" "He's doing fine, mama. He's doing great." She was like, "He's getting a little big." [ Laughter ] The food is rich. Oh, I love you. Love me or the steak? There's room in my heart for you both. I think an overall storyline that I really loved was that of Frank and Denise. She became a nurse and a nurse practitioner, and that's what I am. My husband's a stereotypical military man. He's a lot like Frank. He's a man's man. I mean, as hard as he was willing to fight for his country, he fought for his marriage. And she, you know, did, too. Thursday nights and/or Sunday afternoons. - Really? - Always? [ Chuckles ] It's just when Frank tends to be in the mood. [ Laughs ] Don't you just throw him down and take him? No! I don't. [ Laughs ] Melvoin: Denise was a wonderful character. And she had seeds of almost what I would consider a 1950s housewife to begin with. She was submissive. She was very happy to be in the background. Serpico: I think that's how she and Frank wanted their lives to be. They had patterned their lives on an outdated kind of paradigm. All right, now. You're the man of the house while I'm gone. Dad, I've been the man of the house since I was 7. Over the course of the series, we see her evolve tremendously. All my life, I have been somebody's daughter, somebody's wife, somebody's mother. And I'm pissed that it's taken me this long to realize that there's a me here, too. It was absolutely essential that she make some changes in her life that reflected who she felt she was. Hey, guys. Roland: Are you kidding me? And Frank had to go along for the ride or get left behind. You still want me to be the girl that you fell in love with, the woman that you married, and... [Sighs] God, I wish could be that person for you, but I can't. I miss her. Sometimes I do, too. I guess the transformation first began when she began to transform herself physically. Harder! Come on! She started to change what she was wearing. And Frank was, "Well, uh... - Yeah, that's nice." - You look different. - Different good? - Yeah. Going out? [ Chuckles ] I loved that one. And then she began... She went back to work. Denise: She's in cardiac arrest. Denise was a nurse. - Clear. Woman: - Clear. Shocking. And she need to define herself as that, not just as Frank's wife, but as Denise, the woman in her own right. [ Monitor beeping ] She's got a rhythm. Frank was initially very resistant to her going back to work... again, that '50s model. "I'm the breadwinner. My wife doesn't need to work." Blah, blah, blah. Almost didn't recognize you. What are you talking about? You... focused, vital. Made me remember why I fell in love with you. Frank and Denise most definitely grew over time. There were, obviously, some very important hurdles that they had to cross together. Early on, it was the tension with Jeremy as a young teenager who is struggling to establish his own identity. I'm not going to West Point. We spent the last two long years getting you in. - I... I thought it's what you wanted. - It's what dad wanted. And then he eventually goes and joins the service. Well, I don't have to tell you to make me proud 'cause you already do. Thank you, sir. Why do you still look eight years old? - I know what I'm doing. - Okay. In finding herself, Denise makes some mistakes. She gets involved in some infidelity. I've never been with anyone but f... Denise has violated the most basic tenant of being an army wife, which is that you don't cheat on your husband. Serpico: That was really brutal for Frank. And I know it was for Denise, as well. All I need to know... is it true? It was a mistake, and it's over, and I regret it more than you can know. In that case, I don't see any reason for you to stay here. And while he was just about to cut her loose, he realized that he just loved her so much. And to love is to forgive. And he had to find that forgiveness in his heart and move forward. I don't want to let you go. I love you. I love you. I don't know how we're gonna make this work. That's one of the real seminal moments in this kind of change in Frank where he became much more attuned to his wife and much more attuned to his emotional needs. And he became more emotionally intelligent. What's that for? Hand-eye coordination. And where you planning on putting this? Over the crib. Frank, I'm pregnant. What a surprise. When they told us that that was gonna be happening, I was like, "Really?" Well, when Jeremy was born, it was all just a blur, you know? At least, it was for me. Well, this time's gonna be different. And then you get an opportunity to see Frank, this, you know, this hardass with this little girl that just melts his heart. Frank: And down comes daddy in his parachute. And the wind blows him to the right, and the wind blows him to the left. [ Baby coos ] McNamara: Now, Serpico, I can only imagine when you found out that Catherine Bell was gonna be your wife. You must have though, "Ugh, couldn't I get, like, a good-looking woman?" - Exactly. - [ Bell chuckles ] Catherine and I really had a wonderful dynamic from the get-go, from day one. All we had to do was to look at each other and go to work. It was a real pleasure. I mean, it just such a pleasure being on the show, period. Fuller: I think Bridge and Jeremy's couple could have been probably the most realistic. - Yeah, I feel like that. - I mean, I'm guessing. But you guys, it was the constant not knowing, the pain of always leaving at a moment's notice. Somebody always, at one point or another, is backing up for the other to shine, if you will. Well, everybody's... Every family in the military is always backing up for the military because that is the number-one player in the relationship. The number-one player in the family is the army comes first. That should be part of every marriage vow in the army. What? "For richer or poorer, in sickness and in health," - and "I'll make it up to you." - [ Chuckles ] [ Feedback ] I just want to let you all know that I made 50 grand carrying those kids. That's right. I was a paid surrogate. So, have at it. I was really, really stuck on Pamela and "Army Wives" immediately. Pamela's core always stayed the same, a very down-to-earth, pretty honest person. Our husbands are out there risking their lives, and I can't have an opinion? This sucks. Brigid just brings a remarkable quality of brashness, of earthiness. Why are you talking to the food? She is a redhead, Irish woman. And she plays that to the hilt. Every time I open my mouth, I put another dent in the image of the perfect army wife. A little bit cranky but strong, like a good, a deeply good person. That never changed. One of the things I was always really, really concerned with was things being real... not having Barbie hair on, you know, a working woman with a bunch of kids. I wore the same shoes, I think, and the same earrings and same purse for, like, three years. Where the, uh...? Plasma TV? I returned it. Along with everything else. And I paid my father back. And you didn't think to ask me? I thought about it, and I did it anyway. Pamela and Chase, that relationship depicted a real relationship in life. Almost literally a fight to stay together. They knew they had a connectedness, but they also both knew, I think, that "This stuff isn't easy. I'm not gonna pretend it is." You're not always awesome. You're not always great." Children: ♪ oh, beautiful for spacious skies ♪ Brannagh: We did the Fourth of July episode, and it was the first time we showed Chase leaving Pamela to deploy with Delta Force. [ Cellphone vibrating ] Davidson: You know, missions come up for Delta soldiers very quickly, and the communication between husband and wife can just be cut off. Brannagh: So, it was the first time he leaves with no notice, without her having any knowledge of where he's going. And you can imagine what that does to a relationship. Brannagh: Just the idea that that could be your life and that you could handle that... When we talk to any family in Special Ops, they absolutely said that it was as harsh as you imagine that it is. Mommy, I wish daddy were here. Davidson: There's a certain commitment that soldiers make. Me, too. But marrying a woman who is so smart, so driven, doesn't necessarily even need Chase... That made it really interesting. [ Gunshots ] Your turn. She liked to remind me just about every other episode that she used to be a cop. Reminds me of my cop days. I was a cop over a decade ago. I was a good cop. I did have a whole life before all of this. [ Laughs ] We laughed a lot about that until she finally became a cop again. [ Rock music plays ] Boy: Whoa, mom. Cool. You look like you're gonna go trick-or-treating. Great. [ Chuckling ] Thanks. It was always sort of in the background that Pamela would have to go back to work, you know, find her own passion again. And then it became just, you know, two people pulling. And when two people are pulling, it's gonna break. I need you around more, Chase. I want you to... quit Delta. That was always a struggle between them. I've loved you for as long as I can remember, Pamela. But I don't know how to fix this. I don't, either. Ultimately, we stayed in touch with each other, and we stayed communicating in a healthy way... much healthier way when we -Hello euh... Martine -Messieurs Dame I'll explain you... Waou... it's hudge here! Is that all yours? Well actually it's my wife's... but it's like mine... I'll explain you... Well, let's make it easy: you give us what's best! No need to count every franc! Flex forward -Do you touch or not? -Well I touch with the big toe! -What about the heel? Can you lift the heel? -Well yes, I can lift the heel! No, I mean the heel in the shoe... Inside... Inside the shoe? Yes, I can do it easily Come on Popeye, you have to put her a tread! Yes, yes... Oui, oui... have to put her a tread... from under, yes... Tell me Popeye... The shop closes at 8pm, not 7:45pm. And do wash the floor, cause yesterday it was really to dirty. He's always joking with me Olivier... He loves it... I'll explain you Well guys, I guess everything's here! So Popeye... You make us a little discount, right ? -10% discount? -No problem. I'll ask in case but... -It would be honest from them, considering all we took... -Ca serait commerçant avec ce qu'on a pris? -It would be the least they could do! NO! Well then... Won't be possible... Because... it's not right with them... because of money... Anyway, I'll explain you... Well that's it: here's the bill! OK, I'll take a pen... Do you have an ID? -Come on, we are his friends... -Precisely! -I'll explain you... -Don't worry, we understood... Hey, no kidding, i do really need a double-bed room for this evening Fine, it will be done For tomorrow morning, 2 breakfasts in case your Lady shows up during the night ? Well yes, yes OK, Jean-Claude go! What do you think are the biggest defaults of Jean-Claude? -He's as straight as a stick! -He doesn't plant his ski-sticks! And moreover he's leaning too much backwards... Carefull! I gained speed! -Look, be carefull, you are boring... -Well these things can happen, no? So, we all agree to say Jean-Claude is a bad skier! YES! Well you should know he's the least bad skier among all of you! Bernard... for example. Which is the main default of Bernard? -He's selfish! -This is funny, very funny It has nothing to do with skiing! What's happening is that you ski on one leg only Looks like you had an accident! Did you break your leg, or whatever? No...? So what you will do... Take off one of your skis and you will see that your two legs are useful! Go ahead, take of one of your skis ! It's completly stupid, I'll fall down I just want you to feel... You will see, I'll manage to do it! Be carefull... -Did you feel it? -Yes, I understood well, I understood well! About you Nathalie, you're leaning completly backwards. I feel like you don't want to ski That's not it. It's my shoes, they are too big. Look. It's totally tightened. Oh, i see yes... yes... You should try about 10 velkost smaller You'll come by to the ski shop -I'll never make it -Of course you will: Just let it pull you and don't sit on it. That's all. Really? So I shouldn't sit? No, no, Noooo! Let the pole ("zdr") go now! Let the pole go! Out of my way! Be carefull you, somebody's trying to take your place! Hey slowly... we are all civilised people. Bernard, I can't do anything with these shoes. It's too big! -Well you should tight up the hooks! -But It cannot be more tight... Well look at me and do exactly what i do Go ahead! Hop. Move... Move! Be careful, you're gonna make everybody fall! Are you fine? No! My shoes are too big. We should have filled it with newspaper... You're boring... You could have guessed it before! After the post over there, let the pole go! I can't... I'm stuck on this stuff! But try move out, do something! Well bravo... very handy Oh shit. -Bernard! I'm here! -I'm coming I'm sorry! Will you have dinner with us this evening? Non I can't, I have a meeting. With who? The boss of the hotel I cannot drop her. She insisted so much... And additionaly, I can feel that... euh... tonight... I'll make it with her! -Won't you help me? -No, not now, no... Do you know you bluff me Jean-Claude? You've been here since two days... and you are already about to get a girl! Look Bernard... I think you and I have similar problems: The point is that we cannot really count on our physical appearance. Especially you. So if I can give you an advice: Forget that you don't have a chance, just go for it! Who knows, maybe it will work out of a missunderstanding! Well I'll take the seat-lift, I have to change my cloth Hey, but hurry up, cause the seat-lit will close! HEY YOU THERE! OOHHH! Don't you dare! Doesn't he hear when we speak to him? These are my skis! It's mine... I don't think so, my name's written on it: Bernard Morin! Is your name Bernard Morin? Excuse me, I have the same! -Here they are, look... -Where? Ha yeah yeah... It's the same, exept yours are old! So you take the new and let the old! Thinking about it, you're right: not seen, not taken. If I were you, I'd do the same! Hooo, are you crazy? Everybody can make mistakes! So I can make mistakes too. Look, I'm making a mistake now! But this guy is crazy? ! Careful! My ski! Argh shit... Well it won't fall downer... Me, what I see, it's that when one doesn't know how to ski, he should stay home! But it's not my fault... It's not me who launched it! -Not your falt? Not your fault! Come on... -No but I mistook my skis with others up there... -Well. Who does this ski belong to? -It's mine, but... -Well, so! And it went this close to my mother! -Are you fine mum? -Come on she has nothing... she has nothing... -Are you fine mum? I hope this won't last for long. I'll be late! -Cricri, you will end up by getting cold -For once that I have fun, let me alone! -Christiane, it's enough:we go home! -Listen, I'm coming... Stop ordering, this is incredible! That's fine, that's fine my big girl. -I really do like this sport! -You're making real progress, hey? -Wait 5 more minutes, I'll go and come back once more -Listen... -Did you see how much progress I make? -Oh yeah, oh yeah... Very well... 10km more and we go home! Hey Popeye, you're a real professional to find fitting shoes! Yes,yes... you're nice, these are my clients This one, I can't believe it. Sometimes his humor is boring! Ok, try these... Hey Popeye, do you think we'd be able to do that? A descent from helicopter? Oh, whenever you want! Do you want me to organise that for you? -Are we good enough? -No problem... -I'd give it a go! Popeye! Come over here... 30'000 are missing. Ha ok... Now when I borrow 30K, it's a thief! Ah, well thanks! Thanks Martine! Well if it's like this, I prefer to put it back right now. It's not hard. Yes I would prefer... I don't have it on me. 5 minutes! Do you have 5 minutes? So my friends, how is it going? Bon les amis alors? Où est-ce qu'on en est? -Is this better? -Yes it's better. But not ok... -Come on, you have to tight it... -Ho yes... Tell me, you wouldn't have 300 francs to lend me? It would help me... Come on! You see, it's because you have to tight your shoe Thanks Come on we'll tight that! Nicely... -You see, you have two different levels to tight it -You didn't tight it! Hook after hook... Ha, this is getting better... And the last one Wait don't move it's a tough one! What's happening to you? -Is it too tight? -We should take it off... We would need a screwdiver ("skrutkovac"), or something to make a lever ("paka"), see -Popeye, let me prevent you: If you damage it, you pay! -Yes, yes... it's nothing, it's fine... But you are so stupid, you are so stupid! -She'll get used... -Well i'd prefer it, cause hum... if not we'll have to break the shoes You'll keep it on your feet. And slowly, your ankles will get smaller... And it will be easier to take it off! Nathalie? You come to sleep? I'm exhausted... I'm exhausted... hhaa! I'll sleep like a baby When will I see you again? ... hum.... Wonderful country... hum... Where those who love each other... hum... live hum... together! When will I see you again? ... hum....

It's the best way to improve. We'll ride up with the chair lift, and up there we'll have a glass of hot wine, ok ? OUCH! Do look out! Come on, our gimmick is hardly familiar Well you see man, you don't have the knack to do it -OUCH! -I feel like you Do have the knack now! Nice! Ha shit...

Do what I say, let it go... I don't want to sadden -So what's this emergency about Miss? -It's the Guillains. It's quite... special. -Hello! -Hello Doctor... -What are we here for? What's that? What is THAT! ? -It's Copain(buddy). -How that Copain? Are you dissing me? ! Yes Copain, it's his name... We name him Copain... like pigs (french idiom:as thick as thieves). But what did you come here? I do NOT do animals ! But you were soooo nice last time Doctor But last time I was just helping out! I am not a veterinary. Try to understand that, Mister Guillain Doctor, he's anemic. He doesn't eat... He's anemic? Just EAT him! I cannot help you. Eat him! Move miss, I want this mess out! Move out! And let them eat there pig! You heard me: EAT IT! Coucou Janka Squat... Sting with your stick... Extension! Squat... Sting with your stick...... Extension! Squat... Sting with your stick...... Extension! I had enough, let's stop. Do you want to go and have a glass of hot wine? Yeah... I think i'm gonna vomit. Come on, this is unbelievable... Pissing off people zoning out on the track! This is not right Mister Dusse! It's the 30th time I tell it to you. -Your "Sting with the stick" is really bad! -Yes,yes,yes... Keep this right in your mind! Yes I'm aware of that! It's been 30 times, I know it! Hey! Hey wait! Can we ascend together? I'm with the old and he's driving me crazy now Really? Well as you like! -Your Ski Pass please -Yeah, well it's here, wait... Mister Dusse... You let your SkiPass fall! I'm the one who gathered it. A day will come, when you will forget your head! Yes I know... I know... Mister Dusse, as we have 20 minutes to ascend, we'll take advantage from this time to make a little course about "stinging the stick" And as soon as we arrive, to reward you, we'll go for a glass of hot wine! Mister Dusse, your problem is "stinging the stick" "Stinging the stick" is really wrong... ..."Stinging the stick"... I'm gonna sting the stick into you! Mister Dusse? Are you ok? It's nothing... The hot wine... It's gonna be ok... It's gonna be ok... Are you ready? Just a second... Ha Mister Camus! How are you? Can I speak to you for a sec, please? Yes, yes... a little minute hum... Ready? Go! So I bring you back your stuff. It's from my wife. Considering the fact that I came home earlier than expected I obstructs our way, see? Ha Mister Camus, I think there is a misunderstanding I wouldn't like you to imagine that your wife housed me other than in good faith Ha no... Of course... And as there is only one bed in the house, you had to sleep on the carpet, inevitably Besides it's very very hard... but it still helped me out. I thank you very much, Mrs Camus, as well as yourself. So about the lessons... I don't pay anything? I guess she didn't ski much during my absence, did she? -Not even half of it? -No! -Cause she did ski a bit... -Yes... but no. And I was counting on that as well... -So it's for me... -Yes! That's it. I'll go now... I don't need to throw a punch at you, do I? I guess it's not worth it, is it? No... really not worth it... Bye, Mister hum... Camus. So, what's my time? Shit, I forgot to stop the stopwatch... -Hum... 45... 45... 8 -45.8 Holy cow! 5 seconds less on the same run as yesterday! And I didn't push it hard, I went quiet! It's because of my skis: these skis were second in Cran-Montana! Ha, I'll pulverize them tomorrow for the criterium Ha, I have such a punch men, such a punch! Waouw! Well that's it, it's ok... She's here -Are you sure the cousin is not here? -Yeah, yeah, you know, this fuckhead left 2 days ago It's ok, It's ok... Maybe I'm wrong, but I can tell you that I really feel like it's getting better with Martine Do you think she wiped the slate clean? (=forgave you) Of course, some signs are obvious See, it's been a week, she doesn't speak to me anymore... at all! Think this is a good sign? Oh yes, I know her. She's waiting for me to do the first step She's here, telling to herself... hum... I went too far... He's an incredible man... hum... And meanwhile, she's stuck by the other cousin, you know... Frankly Popeye... Don't you feel like you are the only one who wants to fix this? Yeah maybe, yeah... But anyway it's enough. I cannot live without her anymore And I DID change enormously. You noticed it, didn't you? Yes,yes... for sure So my guess is that it should be ok! The most important is that you feel it Anyway I really wish it to you Popeye, from all my heart, cause you're really a good person Yeah I know... And don't forget your suitcase ... Ha yeah... the suitcase ... Anyway I don't know where to sleep tonight I'm not gonna propose you to sleep at home. You know Gigi... Poor old chap... Hi Martine. I don't disturb you, do I? Cause here it is, I would like to ask you a small favour... I don't have a place for tonight... So I was thinking that... well... Maybe I could come sleep here Cause I know you are alone... I thought you wouldn't mind, would you? Well... Come in. Thanks... It's really great from you... I'm thinking that we nearly didn't rejoin up Finaly, it's thanks to the husband of the woman from Bordeaux. I fucked her during 2 months for 400 francs each day and this fuckhead came back without warning. That's why I don't have a place to sleep. Else I would never have come back ! But what's wrong with you? Did I say a dogshit, or what? Be careful! Be careful! Don't take it like that, please! Ha shit... Yes I'm coming! Coming... Just a sec... Coming... That's it! Ha... You... Hi Jean-Claude. I don't disturb you, you're alone now? Hum yes, at least for now... I need you to help me out Could I stay at your place this evening? Cause I don't have a place to sleep... and if I have to sleep outside, with this cold i'm gonna peg out That's to say it doesn't suit me cause.. I thought i would eventualy "conclude" with the receptionist. Ha really Jean-Claude you are very cool, thank's a lot. Ha no, light... shit... Ho but I see your Lady arrived. No, no, hum... It's just a friend, to help out. -Nothing wrong about it Mister -Course not, nothing wrong, nothing wrong! (Next minute, in 30 minutes, if you want... ... OK after the 30 of us go) I'm gonna pulverize them... I did 45'8 yesterday at the training... (At the start: Number 34, Dr Jérôme Tarrère, France) Ha I felt great on that one (Time of number 34, Dr Jérôme Tarrère: 67'22) What? ! But this is great Jérôme, You're rank is about 40th! -How much did he just say? -67'22 he said No way, there must be a mistake? ! It's 20 seconds more than yesterday, on the same run. Same run, right? Don't get pissed off Jérôme... Besides I think you snagged a door I didn't snag, I ripped! Don't speak about what you don't know! God this girl is dumb! Fine, I'm dumb... very fine... This is unbelievable, 20 seconds more than yesterday. It's almost twice as much! And I went like crazy! Maybe yesterday there was a mistake in the timing? That's it... There's a mistake in the timing. Come on... Come with me, we go to see the judges! But no... Jérôme... no! Yesterday, it was yesterday... Do you think I'm a fool? How do you do your timings? 20 seconds more than yesterday on the same run! Think I will buy your game? ! At ease! And don't count on me next year for the contest This is finished! Finished! Hey Jérôme... You know the other day, maybe we made a mistake... Maybe we didn't read the stopwatch? Well yes, who knows, mabye you did 54' Don't try to convince me... Since 10 years that the criterium is organized they never let a generalist win. Never,never,never! Psychiatrists, urologists, gynaecologists... Loads of them... But generalists... Never! I should have been an ophtalmologist... No, listen... Well, where is Gigi, hey? And the van? They left together Shit, shit, shit! -Hey, what are you doing? -See, now I take this pullover I fold it, place it in my suitcase... I close my suitcase... And I go to have some holidays! Stop your bullshit Gigi, what's wrong with you? Do you realize what you told me in front of everybody? Ha, this is the reason? I'm sorry... It's not that bad, is it? The important thing is my result, and the fact they want to mark down generalists, right? Ho, ok... It's not bad to treat me off dumb in front of everybody? But you know what's important. You always know what's important. Well guess what, I'm gonna do something which is not important: I'll take some holidays. Alone, without you. Who pisses me off, pisses me off, and shit! Calm down Gigi, calm down! At this time you are tired, so you're gonna go up, take two pills and have a rest And we'll discuss about all that when you will be calmer and no longer hysterical. -OK? -OK. In 15 days. If I come back. Gigi, shit! Can't you understand that I put a lot on this run? It's really breathtaking to do 20 seconds more than at the training What is breathtaking is that you can't even realize that your friend may have made a mistake when he timed you... Well this, it goes way over your head, hey? ! You're not able to do 35 seconds at the slalom. You're bad... you're bad. Well I think we have nothing else to say to each other? Well bye, and have nice holidays! The door, fuck! I fuck you! He annoys me... -Excuse me I'm really dumb... -Yes -Shit, the dog! -Pépette... Pépette answer me my darling... I was calling you to know if Annie came by at 7:30? Hey Jérôme. This flour smells strange, doesn't it? Yet... Bravo, This is clever... Yes? And do you know why she didn't do it? Oh, ok... -And Jean-Claude? -Wait a second! Look, if she comes back, tell her to call me, no matter what. I count on you. Thanks Madam. Sorry? Ho, it's Sir, sorry. Bye Sir. So how many will it be? Well two, still two! Theoritically she should be on her way now. Who's Annie? -Is she the receptionist from the hotel? -Oh no, this is an old story. No, Annie is a girl I overthrown skiing. She got hurt, so we immediatly got friendly. Ladies, Gentlemen,good evening! That's it, we have the helicopter for tomorrow. I found you a substitute Jean-Claude. Still not coming? No I can't, I'm on something, and I have good chances to "conclude"... So, you will see, he's a very nice man, and besides, he works on TV. Hi, it's us... Let me introduce you to Marius, my friend. -Good evening -Good evening... -I didn't come with empty hands! -Ho, this is nice, Bordeaux... -Excuse me, it's for me... -Yes, because Marius can't digest white wine. It's barmy, hey? ... Well... Hum... You can give me your coats, please come and sit down. Tell me? Christiane told us you work in hair arrangement. Yes and no... Actualy... I was in wigs, artificials, forelocks But do you sell many of them? Cause it seems quite new to wear these... these... Not at all... You can't imagine how many famous people wear wigs. And is there many bald women? Many! Marilyn Monroe... -Come on! -Marilyn Monroe! Like that, like an egg... This is sausages! Like an egg! She got this from her mother, inherited. Ask to Mister Are you the one who made the wigs for Marilyn? Ha no, no... It's very good. It's famous in our profession. However I did work for the Général de Gaulle. He wanted to change his personality, I made him a very nice ginger-goatee A what? A ginger-goatee. A goatee, ginger! He wanted to change his personality, but finaly I think he never used it. Yes, we would remember it, inevitably... -Who else could i tell them about? -I don't know, there's so many of them... Farouk? Will you tell them the joke? -You know I never manage to tell it till the end -Come on, it's a crazy one... Oh, right, crazy... He was meeting me 10 times a day, and each time he saw me, Marius Francesquini... Do you know what is the highest pitch for a wig-maker? Then inevitably I was answering: "Well no, I don't know...?" Lack of brass... See, I can't do it... Lack of brass neck! He was making some gestures, cause he was afraid I wouldn't understand! What happened to you my darling? Everytime there's a fondue, I do that. You'll see, it's so fun! Are you putting your dental floss? -Excuse me, but i'm really hot -Well yes, you were all red... And you don't know where she could be? Well forget about it, bye Sir. Sorry? Ho... By Madam, excuse me! Well so, will your girl come or not? Yes, just continue, it will make her come First one who drops his bread in the fondue gets a punishment... -But isn't it thick? -We'll have to pick out the spools! Ho no, that's it, there's real thread in it! Who put thread in it, it's inedible! If it's a joke, it's not funny! Thanks Bernard, it's a dickhead joke! But I didn't do anything... So it's you Jérôme, you were with him in the kitchen I promiss you it's not me. I love fondue, I'd never do such a dickhead joke! Well men listen, you could denounce yourself. In this case it could be anybody. Could even be Marius! -Excuse them -It's not that bad... Do you think so? ! I think it's completly dumb Really, some jokes are funny, but this one spoils up the food. -Relly Bernard it's not funny. -But let me go, it's not me, shit... Calm down Bernard There is blueberry pie and salad. Who wants to drink something? -Anybody wants some of my Bordeaux? -No thanks, we're fine... Are you sure she didn't show up? Well then I guess something cropped up. Good evening... Hum... Ladies and Gentlemen ... since the begining of this season, what did we do... 43 fractures? Not more. It's closed Sir! Ho no! It's Seldman, the substitute of Jean-Claude for the helicopter. Get around! You'll see he's lovely. (Get around, get around, ...) Come in Gilbert, come in! Good evening. Let me introduce you to Gilbert, the one who will replace Jean-Claude for the helicopter Sit down Gilbert -I see I know some of you: good evening doctor. -Good evening -Do you want a piece of pie? -Yes, with pleasure Well there's no more of it. Sad, hey? I don't want to be tactless, but your face seems familiar...? -No wonder why, I'm Gilbert Seldman -Mister is a TV star. Really? Which show? I do the weather forecast during the news. I don't want to brag, but I do rain and sunshine on TV. Haaa, haa, did you understand this one...? Wait for me! Finaly I'm free! Hey... this sweeps out the lungs, right? This will make you good, with all the junk you breath during the whole year. -How high are we now? Cause it's hard to breath... -Aproximately 3800m See, it's the station we see downthere. It's low, hey? Popeye... Is this the Mont-Blanc? Pfff... No! This is the Mont-Rose. And then, hum... See, this is the Dent du Guignol And there, behind, the Coulée du Grand Bronze, but hum... we can't see it. Now we feel very small... (anyway you're not very tall...) I feel like the weather's gonna be nice. Yeah, thanks... -Well... Let's go to la Coulée du Grand Bronze -Will we eat there? -Yeah, picnic! -Ha, such a landscape my children, this is wonderful! -And with this white snow it looks so mint... -Really clean -When we think about what Riviera became... Now the sea is disgusting! It's a realy garbage dump, you cannot put your bottom down without sitting on a can. Here, at least, when we come it's clean! The problem is when we leave. Course not! Snow covers everything, so it remains immaculate! -And in summer, when it melts, how do you do? -Well in summer, you don't come here, you go to the sea! -Yeah, but sea is icky -... Ho? Do you guys follow? -Is it still far? -No, it's just there, look! Tell me, is there some people? There is smoke! Yeah, a haven is opened to everybody! Anyway, it could be nice people there. Once there was a squad of policemen... They sang promiscuous songs till 3' am We did have fun! -Good point, my brother is a policeman. -Yeah...? Bood evening! (Buenacera...) -Where do we sleep Popeye? -Well normaly, in the room next door. Marcello Buidi di Milano, buenacera, buenacera... Well they took the room next door, so we can sleep here. Shit, they took the best room! Tell me... Did you see how many they are? They should sleep here! Well Jérôme, will you tell them something? Well tell them... You speak italian so well! Anyway they should understand themselves that they bother. Hum... Bonjourno -What's your name? -Fernanda Ha Fernanda, It's Fernande in french. It's a very nice name. Besides there is a song about this name. It's like: "When I think of Fernande, talala, la la la..." (famous french song of Georges Brassens, the following should be "i have an erection") "When I think of Félicie..." (should be "i have an erection too") "When I think of Fernande, I have an erection, I have an erection" -Oh yes... She knew the song... -She likes Brassens... Hum, is this nice man who's cooking water your husband? -No, no, a friend: Nico... -Ha... Nico! -And the other dickhead in the next room? -Tutti amici (all friends - italian) -Ahhh.... -Tutti amici É bonardo... If I may prepare you spaghettis al italiena, per tutti. -Ho, good idea... -Spaghettis "el pesto" Hum please, "el pesto", is it because it stinks? Come on! Come, I have something to tell you! The italian is free, I can feel it's for me, so be nice, let her alone. In these things, no friendship! Yeah, well it's obnoxious for the others -Well I go to get some wood. Will you help me? -Yes, I'm gonna give you a hand! Yeah, we're gonna give you a hand Leave us alone, leave us, you're boring! Here you are Jean-Claude, you can bring that. Fernada and I, we'll bring the rest. -Ho, this mouse is so heavy -No, these are "pieces of wood", and this is "mouse"... -Hey, this is ingenious! -Let it go, she's crazy. She doesn't know what she wants. Come on, I was this close to "conclude". You spoilt everything. -I don't know what stops me from battling it out! -Fear, no? Yeah, probably. Come on, let's get in! This is where we are, right? This is the border? Yeah, that's it It's funny cause it goes exactly across the cottage -Ho? -This is funny. And now, am I in Italy or in France? Well now you're in Italy And we're in France! I'm worried, I can't go to sleep: I don't have my passport! Finaly it's a real luck that I came alone cause I was supposed to come with a girl, but... Whatever can be said, in couple, you meet less people, don't you think? Time to go to sleep, buena note! Buena note... -Buena note tutti! -Good evening! 'scusat... I begin to feel tired. Buena note Waou Jean-Claude, we are fucked, she's with him! Thank you, I understood... There are wonderful hikes to do in this region. All along the border there is one, which is about 10 kms long, 5 to 6 hours of descent. -Ha, this is beautiful... -I'll take you there one day if you want. You now, about borders there are even more incredible stories Last year I visited the house of the custom officer Rousseau Ho yes, this is an astonishing story This house is crossed by a border. -Yeah, cut in two parts then. -Yes... So they built a wall which signals the border. The house is cut in two parts, very hard to visit. Because of the wall yes... Yes... this is the highest pitch for a custom officer! -Yeah, the same thing happened to Odette, your mother. -Ho yeah... yeah... Imagine that: when she went to Swizerland,she went accross the customs... -Yes... -And she had a big block of chocolate of 500g And they searched her everywhere, everywhere, everywhere! For 500 grams... Well anyway, there are some nice hikes around here... Hum... Do you have a cigaret please? Gracié! I begin to feel tired... Buena note. -Yeah... Buena note... -Good evening... Well i'm gonna go for a walk! This is impossible, they must be paying her! Maybe we need to pick a number? Ho, but she's hot! -She's a real monster you mean! -I want to vomit... Come on, don't push it to hard! E possible your friend doesn't look by the window, per favoré? Gracié mille! I was outside watching the stars and inopportunely somebody opened the shutter and it kicked me in the face... I'm gonna fuck her! I'm gonna fuck her! Excuzi, excuzi! Come on, it's easy to say "excuzi"! -Is this place notorious? -Not at all! I can swear you that last time with the policemen it was really not the same. That said, there were these officers... I can tell, with my brother it wasn't the same game! Bernard, they are snoring now... But this is not possible! These "macaronis" can't do anything in silence! -ENOUGH! ENOUGH! -He? Excuzi... Ha, congratulations Bernard! They were sleeping and now they doing it again! -They're driving me crazy! -Throw them a bucket of water or whatever! You're jealous men... These italians are wicked good! This is not possible, they're gonna do it all night, we would like to sleep! This is enough! Some people would like to sleep! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! Arrivederchi, arrivederchi! Ha, this is not human... these bastards... they exhausted me! -Move your ass, Nathalie! -What do I do with the trash? Just swing it under the beds, we don't care about that! But hurry up... We have to go down. Hey, slowly, we are not beefs! -Put it straight, you're gonna crease everything -Thanks... Careful fingers... Don't get into that mood. You knew it: I have to go I know Marius, but I can't control myself I'm very possessive, you'll have to get used to that I'm making an incredible effort not to collapse But what would it change? When you have to go... you have to go! And you're not staying alone here, you have your friends. Don't forget, you're having dinner together this evening. It will be nice. -They are nice, aren't they? -I like them, but till a measured portion... I don't know what to tell the, i feel so different But you are different! Believe me, oh la la! It's the reason why we are together, isn't it? Surely... Here is a little present for you. By this way I'll still be a little with you this evening. What is it? A plastic oyster. When you take it, it makes "pouet-pouet" You'll always make me laugh... Beware to the departure! -You'll put your seatbelt -Of course! -Do you want me to push you? -Ho yes, I'd like that... -Are you pushing, my Cricri? -But turn... Turn! -Will you phone me when you arrive? -I'll try, but push... push! -Did you hurt yourself? -No it's nothing, you can go peacefully. I don't stop, i'm launched I'll write to you! Be careful my honey! So, do you follow? Slowly, we're not used... Come on let's go... I'm tired... Tell me Popeye? Are you sure this is the right way? Cause I don't recognize this place! Look buddy, if you're afraid you shouldn't go out of tracks! I don't say that for me. We're not alone! Hey.... Go! I'm exhausted... Come on... Put yourself sideways... But I caaaan't Let yourself go... Cause the snow is too limp for me! You already did it! It's too hard... Come... It's a piece of cake... I go, but i'm afraid... It's so fast... In snowdlow! (missprounounced, should be snowplow) It's so fast... It's so fast... It's TOO FAST! -Get off the ground lazybones! -Stop bullshiting, maybe she's injured? -Where do you have pain? -Shoulder! Ok Nathalie, stop this comedy... Don't you see it's painful? ! -Is it very painful? -Yes. Yes, well the head of the bone came out of its lodging. I'm gonna put it back in place, and you'll be better immediatly after! And... Will it be painful? No. It's very painful. My brother got the same. He did suffer! -Gigi! -Yes? -Ho excuse me... Excuse me -When I'll put her arm back in its lodging -Yes? -I'll make you a sign -Yes -At that moment, don't hesitate, kick her. Dryly. To disturb her attention from pain -Me? -Yes. Did you understand? You saw me doing it with the nurse? -Don't worry, you can do it. -Well ok It will be fine And be careful to her arm! It will be a real peace of cake Nathalie... -Are you crazy, I didn't tell you anything! -You told me to kick! But I told you to kick when i'll give you the signal! -But I didn't hear anything... -I didn't say anything! I didn't do the signal! -Would you be able to do it? -I understood, I understood... Ok, Look at me, I'll give you a signal. -Is it finished? -No, it will be right now... -It's not over? Get ready Bernard. It will take 2 seconds! Is it my turn now? But no, but no! Are you a monster? You are a monster! It's for you not to suffer... I'm on edge, on edge... -Are you ok Nathalie, do you follow? -Leave me alone, you! Popeye, you'll print us this hike... Wake up Nathalie! Don't you see we are exhausted? ! Everybody's tired. In a quarter of hour we'll be in the station... A quarter, that's a load of rubish... It's been two hours that it's a quarter! And we don't even have any fixed point... -This is enough! -But Popeye, wait for us! For him it's easy, it's a descent... We're taking a roundabout way, just because it's BEAUTIFUL! Come on, what is that? Nothing, happens often at this time of the year... Here we're safe, we can stop by for 5 minuters Are you kidding, safe... Popeye, we're not gonna keep going blindly! This place doesn't ring a bell for me. So try to remember! -Have you ever been here? -It was summer, try to understand... There were cows all around -It was really different... -But try to remember! Last time you came, did you go on the right or on the left of the stump? Well that's the point! I already mistook twice: Should go to the left and I had been on the right Or the contrary. I don't know... Well, so did you find the way? -Just a minute! We're evaluating the situation... -You're lying Jérôme You're lying. You have no idea of where we are. We are completly lost. We're all gona die frozen And me I'll never see Pépette again and you will be happy, happy! Gigi calm down! Calm down... Calm down! Stop figthing. It's all my fault But we don't give a damn that it's our fault! You shouldn't have taken us here! We're in the shit because of you And the only thing you think of doing is complaining on your fate! You have no courage, you are just good to be the dogsboy of your wife! We are in shit. Gigi told it to us: we're all gonna die here We are in this shit because of you, because you are a dumbass. And you are cuckold and you ask for more! -Bernard? -What? -Excuse us Popeye. -No but it's ok... Anyway it's all true Let's forget about all that. Now that we rooted out the devil... It will get better, we're gonna rebuild things on better bases. We're gonna find a way out by a way or another. It's nice Jean-Claude... You're the only one who doesn't yell at me. Bastard, I'll kill you! Ho! We are safe and sound... I can see the CHRIST! Do you know about this repository? Well yes, it's Notre Dame of the Touffe -So where are we? -Well in the Massif of the Touffe! -And by which way should we ski down? -But I have no idea! I never set a foot here! I don't care. You go for rescue. I won't move anymore! I'm exhausted, my shoulder is painful. Go and get the helicopter, then come back. -Well Popeye, what do we do now? -I'll go for the helicopter No way. If you fail, nobody will ever know where we are. -Yeah... -So we'll go with you and the women will wait for us Well, I wouldn't like to delay you... And it's better if a man stays with the women... In case they would have a malaise though... Can I stay too? No, no... It's full now! Gilbert... stop! Skis rankled, skis rankled! You're too slow! You're too slow! You have to go back up by foot. You're delaying us. No way, considering all I descended, I continue! NO! We'll be late for the helicopter. Take off your shoes and ride up by foot. -Come on... you delay us, sincerely. -Ha, nice, the hike! Considering the price it costs, thanks... -yeah yeah just go... -You're delaying us... Even I descend faster! -Come on kids, it's hard but we should go. -We're coming right now... Are you ok? Keep the pulse: it will be night in an hour! Wait for me, i'm loosing my cap! If you were jammed on a desert island with a guy like me... ...How long would you hang on? Well it depends on what we would have to survive But it's not what I meant! I meant, hum... human rapports! Like when you are in an exiguous place, like... an elevator for example? Hey, didn't I tell you? Once I got stuck in an elevator. With a man i absolutely didn't know... It's incredible, hey...? These ideas come so fast! Yes, well that's it. We are in the elevator, so there are necessarily ideas coming -But it's normal! -Yes, it's normal. But there's a hudge gap between these ideas and reality... We're not animals... Of course we're not animals. It's not the point, but... Imagine... It's just an assumption, hey? ! Imagine rescue doesn't show up? Considering the fact that, that hum... We all have these ideas beacause we are in the elevator... It would be a pity to die without enjoying the pleasure of our senses a last time Ha but be careful Jean-Claude... The difference is that the man in the elevator... he was attracted to him! You don't control these things... You're right... Hey? Where are you going? I'll walk straight ahead... In the best case I'll get to the station Otherwise i'll just get mashed on a rock... It won't be a big loss for anybody... Bye girls... Wait Jean-Claude... Don't be a fathead! Don't take everything at the first degree... Does it mean that possibly... If you were really hopeless... We might consider to "conclude"? Yes. Well only if there really no more hope. Yes. Well then we'll see. I don't know why, but I feel like they won't show up. Well in 10 minutes i'll consider us like definitely lost! Han! Listen! Sounds like the breathing of an animal A beast? I'm afraid... -There's a beast! -I'm afraid! It's him! Ho it's you... Ho Gilbert... Gigi and I are really happy to see you. You can't imagine... Cause you consider this like rescue? Oh YES! Look Popeye... You tell us: we go straight ahead and we'll be there... It's what you told us, right? Yeah but I probably made another mistake... The point is... Instead of going back up by food in the snow We'll be faster if we climb here! I think the station is just behind, see... Ha yeah yeah.. Climb up on that? You do it. Me I don't -You'll pay me that! -Come on dudes, climb is easy Hey! It's not written "alpinist", ok? Come on go, go, go! Stop discussing, you're loosing your oxygen! But climb up... Popeye, there's no more grip! Calm down Bernard! But I am CALM! There's no grip, no grip! Calm down Bernard, calm down! -I will help me, lean on me... -But the snow is limp! If it was hard, you would slide down! So don't complain! -Ha, but you are loosers, hey... -Shut up, you... -SHUT UP! Come on, lean on me AAAHH what's happening? We are in the void, you have to pull us up now Pull Popeye! PULL! I can't, you are too heavy But what are you doing Popeye? ! Pitch all you can! -Bags... -Hold firm, hey? -So? -Two minutes... -This is better -Yes, but I still cannot pull the rope Shoes! Be careful... I dropped everything now! -Pitch your curb chain! -What? Pitch your golden chain there! But it has no weight? ! Popeye! He has an enormous golden curb chain, and he doesn't want to pitch it, shit... It's a family cameo. I'm not gonna pitch my chain? ! Pitch it! Pitch it! You won't bring it back! That's it? did he drop it? Did you drop it? My curby chain... That's it, it's better: I'll pull you up! Hey man... Why don't you enjoy the bench to sleep for a while... At least one of us would have rest... No... Sleeping is dying! -Haaa... Be carefull to my shoulder... -Excuse me... Closer to you my god... closer to you... Living, misterious... HHHaaa! THERE! See, we were not far from the village! Huh? 400 meters only! But you have to know the place. Well, I'm gonna call the vicarage to warn your friends and tell them you arrived. "Parisians, face of dogs... Parigots, face of calf" Go home, you! Hey? Is there some beasts? ! But this is so beautiful! Your place is really stylish! Well that's it, just have to wait for your friends to come to get you Maybe they are hungry after their adventures? ! Ho no, we don't want to take advantage, you've already been so kind! Me honnestly, I'm dying of starvation... Me too, I wouldn't mind having a bit e of something... So, just say it! Can you smell this scent of wood fire? Oh, it's so sweet in there place And it's clean. I would eat on the floor. I'm sure they have raw ham from mountains... Do you know they still kill raw ham by themselves? Me I'm so hungry that I would eat anything! My god... this lace! But look at this lace It's so fine! Ho... There's no TV! Ha, this is not "baguette"! -I did it... -Well congratulations, your bread/breast(buttock) are very rounded! This, is a receipe from the country! It's named... The "foune"! -Smell this! -Oh, it's ok. You know, it looks good! We're gonna serve it "rubbed on". Like in our traditions! Which means... we rub it on the bread. Thanks. And what is that, inside? Whell that... That is done with all the rests of cheese of the year We macerate it with fat... wood alcohol, during... two or three seasons. And we put the rinds of ham in it too! Eat kid! You're gonna become a real mountain man! There's not such a thing to get back your energy! Humm.. it's delicious... We can feel well the taste of fat... It doens't go unnoticed! This one is at least 3 years old That's too say how good it is! What are these white things inside? This? It's worms Well yes, like that, there is meat too! I'm vegetarian. The small animal isn't gonna eat the big one! Excuse me, I need to go out! Christiane! You're here? Waou... You just scrapped me... like an old sock! But no... We got in some troubles, you were right not to wait for us. I was aching... to wait At one moment I felt so alone that I wanted to kill myself! So i ate the dozens of oysters... What happened, why didn't you wait for me? Cause we made a mistake on the track, so now we have to go and get the others. -Are they on the tracks? -No, they were picked by some peasants. But it's the police station that told us, we have to go. -Consonant? -S. -Vowel? -I. -Mister Geoffroy? -Sorry, 7. -Miss Parion? -Not better. -"Ambulés" -"Ambulés"! There was "Blumaise", in 8 letters! Ha, here are your friends who came to get you! -Good evening gentlemen! -Good evening! Well gentlemen... We thank you a lot! It's nothing, nothing... -You were 500 meters from the village... -Only thing is, people have to know the mountain Yes, yes... People have to know the mountain... Although we wouldn't have got here, if these gentlemen didn't come, right? Take me... Listen gentlemen, we'll just thank you a lot for your hospitality And we're gonna leave You're not gonna leave like that, without drinking a little something, right? Oh no no... We don't have time now Ho we do, we do, we do... Gladly! it will be a pleasure! I'm gonna get the bottle then! You are a bit harsh! They are charming, without them you would still be in the mountain! It's the least we can do, no? You are crazy, you don't know what they eat... But it's very good! Here it is! Tell me, hum... How do you do to creep the... hum... into... toad(big frog)... into the bottle? So we make it dry... Then it becomes very thin... So it comes in. Then with damp, it balloons. Not too much, hey... That's it! Thanks... So this, you have to drink bottoms up (na ex)! Otherwise... It burns your tongue... It does good! Your turn now. Well... Cheers (Nazdravie), hey? ! Cheers... Thanks, hey... And good luck, above all... Ha, the cap jumped It's strong... It would clear the toilets! It's not a drink for wimps! What is this shit? ! It's liquor from shallot (a kind of onion) But deviled with garlic juce Cause shallot alone is a bit flavourless Very fruity... It's tasty, hey... It has some "return". Ho, holy cow... So what's your address? Cause i'm coming to Paris in a month with a girl... It's for 15 days, 3 weeks, so it would help me out for, hum... hosting...

You had the presence of mind Cause I would have given him the right address Well yeah, he's the kind of guy who comes to live at your place for 3 months! Ultimately, he's a boy who's nicer if not known! What's nice with Bernard and Nathalie... It's that they are really generous! It's true, they are open handed I barely asked them, and they proposed me to house me! Hey look, Miss Schmitt is out of the clinic Ho shit... Madam? Aaah Madam... So? Subtitles: Benoît Doury (2007) Pre moja Janulienka I don't see the listing for Bourg-Saint-Maurice. I'm not surprised, this is Saint-Lazare. It's written Saint-Lazare on my ticket. - Is it my eyes? - I think so. Yeah, it's my eyes. Keep your skis parallel. One more turn and we'll come to a stop on the ridge. Ma'am? Mrs. Schmidt? Help! Damn! Ma'am! Ma'am! Damn, what a job! Don't move, Mrs. Schmidt! SNOW JOB Hi, Jérôme. Come and see this. Don't say anything. It's not my fault. I wasn't with her. - You're too much. - I have enough problems. - Hello. - Hello, doctor. Hello, ma'am. - It's her knee. - I can see that. It doesn't look too bad. Is that where it hurts? It's just dislocated. We'll set it for you. You'll feel better. - Ready? - Ready, doctor. Go! - Didn't hurt! - Yes. No. Alphachymotripcine, a tight bandage and aspirin for the toothache. Get my bags, please. Sorry I'm late. I was held up in Paris with girlfriend problems. - What's your name? - Jean-Claude, what's yours? Dusse with a D, as in Dusse. Room 14. I'll show you up. This is a problem, because I asked for a double room. A girlfriend from Paris might come and stay. Maybe. Sorry, sir, but we're booked solid right now. Maybe if we knew the date she was arriving. It could be tonight, or tomorrow... And she's not the only one. What are you doing tonight? The guy doesn't know how to park. - There's no damage to ours. - Are you sure? - Nothing at all. - Good. Oh, damn! Forget it! - Piece of crap! - Exactly. - Thanks. - Sorry, I'm exhausted. I'm Mr. Morin. I need the keys to my condo. - It's number 2... - 205. 205? There's a slight problem. The people haven't left yet. Oh, no! It should have been ready yesterday! - I'm tired! - What floor is it on? The 2nd floor. - I'm tired. - Then move it! Do you have your card? - Hello, I'm Mr. Morin. - What is it? - You're in our room. - I'm sorry, but my wife has been sick. We'll be out of here right away. My wife was sick, too. It's your mistake! It was ours at 10 after midnight. Or even 1 minute after. I'm tired. This is our room! Calm down! 2 weeks ago, we had the same problem, but we didn't make a fuss. Then you're a doormat. I have it for 2 weeks. What if everyone's late? Next year, I'll be skiing in July! Don't get mad. Let's help them with their bags. Thanks. Hurry up, honey. - Excuse me. - Sorry. Are you ready, honey? - What the hell is this? - This is a problem. I don't think you've read the rules. There are 15 people time-sharing this condo. The décor should be to everyone's liking. This little hook is a personal touch. We shouldn't have to look at your bad taste. I don't mean to rush you... Thanks a lot. 'Bye! Don't forget your bag. Thank you! I suppose I'll get blamed for this. It's a jungle out there! Home at last! Look, they forgot their Scrabble game. We scored! No, we have to give it back. Hey, you forgot something! - Thanks very much! - You're welcome. - Miss! - Yes? What are crêpes Gigi? They're coated in buckwheat and sprinkled with warm rose petals. They're delicious! I'm sure. I'll have a sugar crêpe and a beer. You're in the wrong place. We don't make that here. All our crêpes are on the menu. Do you have batter? Sugar? Make a crêpe and put sugar on it! Can you believe that guy? Where the hell does he think he is? Don't come back! - What happened? - Another sugar crêpe. How's my little Poopsie? - What was the emergency? - Just a dislocated knee. - Who was it? - A Swedish girl. Poor thing. - Was she nice? - Very nice. Great looking, amazing figure, and brains, too. I think she liked me. I'm glad you had a good time. I've been working all morning, if you're interested. - Don't be mad. - Don't touch me! You're lucky to meet great people in your job. I have to wait on these assholes with their sugar crêpes! I'm sorry! Hello! Yoo-hoo! It's me! Christiane the esthetician! Christiane! You've changed!

Will you sit down and have a drink? Are you hungry? No, I just came to say hi. Marius is waiting for me. There! The old... The guy... Um... in the hat? Yes, that's him! But be discreet. Marius is married. You're terrible! - You understand? - Of course. - I'm happy to be here! - So are we. You look great! - I'm taking off. Not a word! - Our lips are sealed. - How's Popeye? - Get ready. He dumped his wife to live with a girl in Paris. A total disaster! The family got involved and the girl split. He came back after a month with his tail between his legs. In the meantime, his wife replaced him. Is he still working at the store? Yeah, but the other guy's in charge. She was nice to take him back. - Gigi! - That's pathetic! - Anyway, he's really nice. - Popeye, look who's here! Hi, handsome! You look great! - Come and take our money. - We're serious customers. How's it growing? We want you to dress us from head to toe. Let's start with parkas. This is my wife, Martine, and her cousin. - Hi! - Hi, Martine. - I'll explain later. - Is all this yours? It's my wife's, but it's like it's mine. I'll explain later. Give us the best you've got. Spare no expense. Bend forward. - Do your toes touch? - The big toe. - Can you move your heel? - Of course. No, inside the boot. - In the boot? - Yeah. Yeah, more or less. Put in an insole. Yes, an insole underneath. Yeah. Popeye, the shop closes at 8:00, not at 7:45. Sweep the floor, because yesterday it was filthy. He's always joking around. That's just him. I'll explain later. I think you've got everything. Can you give us a discount? Say 10%? No problem. I'll just ask... - Considering all we bought. - It's only fair. No! I can't do it. Because they don't want to. Because of the money... I'll explain later. So, that's that. - Give me a pen. - Yeah. - Do you have ID? - They're friends of mine. Exactly. - I'll explain later. - We figured it out. I really need a double room for tonight. OK, 2 breakfasts in case she arrives during the night? Sure. Let's go, Jean-Claude! What are his main problems? - He's too stiff. - He doesn't use his poles. He leans too far back. I can't stop! - Watch it! - It's not my fault. So we agree that Jean-Claude sucks? - Yes. - He's the best of all of you. - What's Bernard's problem? - He's selfish. - That's not nice. - In terms of skiing. You only use one leg. Did you injure the other? - Got pins or something? - No. If you take off one ski, you'll find out that both legs work. Take off one ski. I'll break my neck! - I want you to feel it. - I can do it. - Did you feel it? - I got it! Nathalie, you lean back like you're not into it. No, my boots are too big! - My feet are at the front. - Yeah. Yeah. Try about 10 sizes smaller. Come to the store. - I can't do this. - It's easy! Let it pull you and don't sit yet? Hello. Are these your sisters? Your sisters? Sisters? Food. Food for me. Food for me. Food. Right. "Ma-ken." How's it cooking? Right. That looks good. Can I taste? Damn, that's spicy! This is really tasty! What a wonderful meal! This is tasty! Really tasty! Really. I swear. It's better here than over there. It's better here than back home. Yes. Much better! And that! No comparison. Bravo! Very good. Cigarette. After a meal, always a cigarette. More precisely, Gauloises. Just like it says on the pack. Cigarette? Ready? Go! See that? Scared you, didn't I? This is good. Isn't this nice? This is good. This is paradise! No, start over. This is how to play jacks. It's the other one that counts. Like this. Like that. It's nothing, don't worry. Leave it alone, it's nothing. Stop it! Look at the kite! Look! I make you an airline, and that's the thanks I get? How encouraging! Want to try? I've got eight left. At two per day, in four days I'll quit. Try it. At least you appreciate that! Yes, this is me. Me! That will take forever. You need a knife. Where's my knife? Have you seen it? Damn, I lost my knife. Knife. Knife. I don't want any more. I'm done. No. Stop. But I'm stuffed! What's this? I found it over there. Did someone come before me? Here. Someone like me? No, like me. Fine. Stop it! What's wrong with you? That's enough! Not like that! She scratched me. Finished! That's enough. Stop! Stop! Croissant? Croissant? Hey, Benoit. Stop! Are you okay? Nothing broken? Written and directed by SHUJI TERAYAMA This is the story of a man searching for a nursery rhyme. THE GRASS LABYRI NTH A man tells his wife, "Today a strange boy came to see me. He might be the son of that family at the Black Door Estate where you were a servant. " "He said he's been looking for you for a month. He asked if I knew the words to a nursery rhyme. " "I'm busy enough without having people come to talk about you. " "I threw him out. " Akira seeks the words to the nursery rhyme. "Three gifts for a little girl- Oharu- who may be dead. " That's all he remembers. His mother often sang it. He visits the school principal. "Ask your mother. " "They told me she's dead. " "They say one of my aunts sang it with her. She wore a pretty red ribbon in her long hair. She was married to a clothing merchant and she went mad at 1 9, on the day of the Maidens'Festival. " "She's been in an asylum ever since. I wrote to ask for the words, but she sent love poems, not nursery rhymes. " The school principal doesn't remember. He has had so many students. He has forgotten Akira's mother's face. Even her name doesn't stir any memories. "Anyway, no one sings nursery rhymes anymore. " When Akira was a child, his mother often asked, "Akira, what are you dreaming about? I know you're not really here. You're near me, but you are gone. Your bones are here, but you are gone. " Akira remembers one summer day. She asked him, "Would you prefer a bath or a meal?" He asked, "Who are you?" She asked, "Where are the chopsticks?" That voice sang the nursery rhyme. Had he really heard it? At first, Akira didn't say anything, just that he'd enjoyed his bath and "Mother, look at me. " But later, "Who is that woman in the barn?" "Chiyojo, "said the mother. "Don't go near her. She's a nymphomaniac, and maybe a witch. " "She went mad from waiting for the man she was predestined for. It is a custom that on the Day of the Bull in the Year of the Bull unmarried 20-year-old women change their clothes, bathe, wash their hair, put on makeup and lock themselves in a room. They face the wall to concentrate their soul, then they pray. In the mirror will appear the face of the man they are predestined for. But no face appeared for that woman. She waited one year, two years, and after three years, she went mad. She stays locked up in the barn. Sometimes she goes out in the moonlight to look for a man. " "What if she comes out for me? What if she comes after me again?" "Don't worry. Mother is near. " Akira visits the temple priest. "What do you mean, a 'new'mother? As if anything new could existI Nothing on earth is new. Hidden memories surface from time to time. That's all. " Akira asks, "Why am I obsessed with the words to that nursery rhyme? Why am I condemned to travel?" "Why ask?"says the priest. But Akira persists, "Rerhaps I have another mother? Rerhaps I must travel until I find her?" "Nonsense, "says the priest. "Your eyes follow a bird in the sky and you don't see the sky. " Nevertheless, Akira saw Chiyojo again. This time, his mother's reaction was terrible. She slapped him, bound him, insulted him. He asked for forgiveness and promised to never do it again. She left him tied to the tree all night. In the morning, before going in to town, the mother said, "Don't be afraid. I'll write magic formulas so she won't come near you. " What she wrote on his skin and clothes were the words to the nursery rhyme. "Rolling ball, like the moon. Soft sweet ball like my mother. First a box. Second, a red thread. Third, a wide-sleeved party dress. All for Oharu, who is perhaps dead, but I don't know where. " "No one will ever bewitch you now. " Akira remembers his mother's words, "You'll be my son for all eternity. " He thinks he remembers other words about a cruel mother, an imprisoned servant, considered a nymphomaniac but in reality, raped by the husband and kept in a barn for 1 0 years. Who had said these words? "A ball, a floating ballI They ask me to catch it. I look at that round thing floating without bubbling, the setting sun in its wake. I want to catch it without wetting my feet. A passing policeman removes his hat and deftly scoops up the ball. The policeman is one of Akira's mother's lovers. " "As for Akira's father, they say he's a naval officer, but no one's ever seen him. A strange mother-son relationship. " "A strange mother-son relationship? Why strange? In a place with a school, nothing strange can happen. " When the girl's body washed ashore, she was dead. She'd committed suicide with the deserter. Akira stops before a house of pleasure. So like his mother- "But it's another woman- A man was insulting my mother. " Akira questions the servant. "No, that's a lullaby. " The servant thinks. Later, in the house of pleasure, one of the girls hums the nursery rhyme. "Not the music, "says Akira. "The words. Remember the words. " "Those aren't the right words, "says Akira. "Of course not, "says the girl. "I just made them up. " "But what comes after what you sang earlier?" "I don't remember. " "Try to remember. " "You didn't come here to sing, did you?" On the road, Akira passes a couple of umbrella repairers. Akira returns to the Black Door Estate, his childhood home. An old man comes out of the house. "May I see the girl with the ball who just entered?" "What girl? I am alone. " "Rlease have some tea. I've lived here alone for the last 30 years. " "That thing looks like a ball. " "It's a conception stone. It makes women fertile. Some are as small as Go tokens. Some as large as rice cakes. A childless woman will conceive if she caresses it. Today, everything is a business. Old women sell these stones. Sometimes they are asked, 'Instead of children,just give me the mother. ' But many young women buy them for their magical power. " "My mother was making love, but that man was me. " "Don't be afraid. Mother is near. " He opens the last door and finds his mother, surrounded by fairies. "Akira,you've gotten me pregnant again. " Akira sees his death as a child drowned in the river. Did he drown himself? . The mourning villagers follow the cortege. Among them is his mother, wearing a wedding dress. Akira will set off again. He'll roam from country to country. The sea? He'll cross it. Mountains? He'll climb them. The clouds will be his guide. What he seeks doesn't make sense. It refuses all explanation. He'd like to hear the words to the nursery rhyme just once. Until then, he travels, he travels.

French translation by Boris Villeneuve. French narration by Florence Carese. THE CUPBOARD DI RECTED BYWALERIAN BOROWCZYK BASED ON THE STORY BY GUY DE MAUPASSANT One evening last winter, I was suddenly overwhelmed by one of those moods of desolate weariness which seize one's soul from time to time. Alone at home, I realized that if I stayed there, I'd suffer one of those dreadful attacks of sadness, the kind that lead to suicide if they occur too often. I took my umbrella and went out without knowing what I would do. Arriving on the boulevard, I wandered past the cafes, half-empty due to the rain, one of those fine rains which dampen one's spirits as well as one's clothes. Not a good strong rain, coming down in sheets, forcing out-of-breath passersby to seek shelter in doorways, but a rain so fine that one can't feel the drops. One of those humid rains. An incessant shower of imperceptible droplets that quickly cover one's clothes with a watery foam, icy and penetrating. What to do? I roamed here and there, looking for somewhere to spend a few hours, noticing for the first time that Raris had no place for nighttime entertainment. Finally, I made my choice. Could you dry this? Without opening it. That's bad luck. Backstage access is strictly forbidden! Here. Now let us pass! That's enough! Leave! Thanks. - Can I help you? - Yes, they hurt. Such pretty feet. Take care of them. Pardon me. What's your name? That's the price for a halfhour. Fine. A night is six hours, or 1 2 half hours, which equals 1 2 units. I'll pay you double, 2 4 units, to spend the night with you. Are you kidding? Together all night? I'm in a sad mood, and the idea of spending the night alone is unbearable. Okay. I'll get changed. Go! Quickly! It's dark here! Have you lived here long? Six months on January 1 5. - Where were you before? - Moselle Street. I left because the concierge was out to get me. - She even sent the police to my place. - Police? They searched everywhere. The apartment was unrecognizable. Furniture overturned, drawers on the floor. It was awful. There'd been a theft in the neighborhood, and she used it as a way to get her revenge. Revenge? Why? It's a long story. She'd been spying on me for a while. She'd knock on my door almost daily asking to borrow salt or chives. - Chives? - Yes, or a needle. It was her way of finding out who I was with. A horrid woman. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. It's a bit steep. - Yes, it is. - We're almost there. Here we are. Let me help. No, keep going. It's on the right, at the end. The director of the theater allows me to stay in an old dressing room. A nice, quiet place. Do you live alone? Obviously. I'm an honest girl. You're staying until tomorrow? That's what we agreed. Okay, honey. I was just checking. Wait a minute. I'll be right back. She seems to be talking to someone. Who could it be? Her pimp? I'm strong, and so are my fists. We'll see what happens. You can come in. Make yourself at home, honey. What's wrong? Turned into a pillar of salt? Hurry up! Thanks. What's this? A woman on her own needs to defend herself sometimes. Some men are rascals! Yes, but not me. I'm an honest man. You're an angel. - What's that noise? - Don't worry, honey! It's the girl next door. You can hear everything. The walls are so thin, like cardboard. What are you doing? That one is sealed up. Don't you believe me, honey? I believe you. But with rascals, you never know. Do you mind if I smoke? A mild cigar, very fragrant. - Go ahead, smoke. - Thanks. Do you have a light? Driven by the silly curiosity which makes all men question these creatures about their first love affair, to raise the veil on their first sin, to find a trace of their lost innocence, to love them, perhaps, for a fleeting memory evoked by a word of truth, by their former ingenuousness and modesty, I questioned her about her first lovers. I knew she'd lie. It didn't matter. Among the lies, perhaps I'd discover something sincere and moving. Tell me, who was your first man? He was a shipbuilder, honey. Tell me about it. Where were you? Argenteuil. What were you doing there? I worked in a restaurant. Which restaurant? - The Fair-Weather Sailor. Do you know it? - Good Lord, yes. That's Smiley's place. Yes, that's it. How did he court you, this shipbuilder? While I was making his bed, he forced himself on me. Suddenly, I remembered the theory of my friends'doctor- an observant and philosophical doctor whose work at the hospital put him in daily contact with unwed mothers, prostitutes, with all the shame and misery of women, the poor women, the prey of awful men who roam around with money in their pockets. "Always, "he told me, "A girl is always corrupted by a man ofher own class and social standing. I've seen it time and time again. We accuse the rich of picking the common girls'flower of innocence, but that's not true. The rich buy a pre-picked bouquet. They might pick from the second flowering, but never the first blossom. " I know your story. I do. The shipbuilder wasn't your first. I swear it, honey. You're lying, my pet. I promise. No, you're lying. Tell me the truth. I'm a sorcerer, pretty girl. I'm a sleepwalker. If you don't tell the truth, I'll put you to sleep and I'll find out. How did you guess? I told you, I'm a sorcerer. Go on, talk! The first time wasn't much. It was at the village festival. They'd hired a chef, Mr. Alexandre. As soon as he arrived, he did exactly as he liked. He ordered everyone around like a king, even the boss and his wife! He was handsome and tall. He bustled around the kitchen. He yelled constantly, "Bring butter! Eggs! Madeira!" We had to bring it on the double or he'd be furious and the things he'd say made you blush down to your socks. At the end of the day, he went to smoke his pipe in the doorway. I passed with a stack of plates and he said, "Come on, kid. Take me to the river and show me the sights." Like a fool, off I went. Down by the river, he forced himself on me so fast, I didn't know what he was doing. He left on the 9:00 train. I never saw him again. Is that all? - I think Florentin is his. - Who is Florentin? My child. That's Florentin. Very nice. You convinced the shipbuilder he was the father, didn't you? Of course. Did the shipbuilder have any money? Yes. He even gave me a 300-franc allowance for Florentin. Very good, my girl. You're not as dumb as people think. How old is Florentin now? He's a big boy. He'll soon receive his first Communion. And ever since, you've practiced your profession conscientiously. I do what I can. It's nothing,just my neighbor. Honey, I swear it's nothing! Mommy! - What's the meaning of this? - I went to sleep and fell. - Don't scold me. - What do you expect? I can't afford to send him to boarding school! I don't earn enough for an extra room! When I'm alone, he sleeps with me. When someone comes for an hour or two, he can stay in the cupboard. He's used to it. But when you stay all night, it's bad for him to sleep on a chair! I'd like to see you... spend the whole night on a chair! I fell. I'd like to see you try it! It's not my fault. It's not my fault. One, two- Seven. Here. It's not my fault, Mommy. - Utter satisfaction. - Delicious. Don't be nervous. It's only a second-rate audience tonight. I still have my professional pride! THE END [Crickets Chirping] [Dog Barking] I made the reservations for 8:15. We're gonna be late! [Doorbell Rings] Dr. "Minakis"? Mandrakis. It's okay. Everyone gets it wrong the first time. - You're Jill. Come on in. - Hi, Jill. I'm Mrs. Mandrakis. Honey, could you get this for me, please? Thank you. Oh, I wrote the number of the restaurant on the notepad by the phone. Now, if we're not home in two hours, that means we've decided to go on to a movie... and won't be back until after midnight... Is that okay? - Sure. I've told my service to pick up any calls coming in on my office phone, so... Oh, the children are asleep upstairs, first door on your left at the top of the landing. Now, they're both just getting over really bad colds, and I had a terrible time getting them to sleep, so please try not to wake them. - Okay. - Do you have any questions? - No. Okay, great.

[Girl Over Phone] Are you over at Dr. Mandrakis's? - Yeah, I've been here for about an hour already. - Isn't it a neat house? - I guess. I haven't looked around much. - Did you see his kids? - They were asleep when I got here. They're really cute. So, what's goin' on? You think you're gonna be talkin' to him sometime tonight? - Who? - Bobby. Probably. You know, Bobby asked me to go out with him this weekend, and I was really, really tempted, 'cause I like Bobby a lot... as much as you do. But I told him I couldn't 'cause I didn't think it was right, because you were my friend. - You are my friend. Yeah, I guess so. Listen. Do me a favor. Just give Bobby the number here, okay? Don't tell him I told you to. - Okay. I gotta go now. - Okay. Bye, Nance, and thank you. Yeah. Bye. Bye. [Phone Rings] Hello? [Click, Dial Tone] [Phone Rings] Bobby?

He just keeps calling. Well, there's really nothing we can do about it down here. - Is the phone listed in your name? - No, I'm just a baby-sitter. It's probably just some weirdo. The city's full of 'em. Believe it or not, we get reports like this every night. - It's nothin' to worry about. - Oh. - Hey, have you tried whistling? - What? Well, if you can find a good loud whistle somewhere in the house, blow it into the phone, hard, next time he calls. Probably break his eardrum. He won't bother you after that. No, I...

They have slender and wiry stems with small leaves which are evergreen with dark pink flowers. Cranberries are usually eaten during Thanksgiving in the United States. They are also eaten in Europe and some parts of South America. Cranberries are strong cash crops for certain U.S. states. They are turned into juice, sauce or jam. Since 2000, cranberries have been marketed as superfruit due to their antioxidant and nutrient qualities. = = = Victoria Tolstoganova = = = Victoria Victorovna Tolstoganova (Russian: �������� ���������� ������������; born Moscow, 24 March 1972) is a Russian actress.

Nerima is on the northern border. Shinjuku is on the west. = = = Assembly line = = = An assembly line is a manufacturing process which is a very important part of industry. In an assembly line, parts are added to a product in a sequence. Each worker and machine does one part, and the parts are put together to make the finished object. This makes a product much faster than with handcrafting-type methods, where one person made the whole object. The division of labour was discussed by Adam Smith in his book "The Wealth of Nations" (1776). He used the manufacture of pins as an example of increasing productive efficiency. Ford. The assembly line developed by Ford Motor Company between 1908 and 1915 made assembly lines famous as an example of mass production. The result was a cheaper car, the Ford Model T, and higher wages for Ford workers. Henry Ford was the first to master the moving assembly line, and was able to reduce labor hours needed to make a car, and increased numbers of cars and parts. Ford was the first company to build large factories around the assembly line concept. Mass production by assembly lines was the catalyst which started the modern consumer culture by making possible low unit cost for manufactured goods. It is often said that Ford's production system was ingenious because it turned Ford's own workers into new customers. The lower prices turned a huge potential market into a reality. The greater demand allowed further economies of scale to be exploited. This bootstrapping quality of growth made Ford famous and set an example for other industries. The idea was not invented by Ford. Its use in America may have started with the production of cars by Ransom E. Olds in 1901. History. The earliest example of an assembly system is the Terracotta Army of the 3rd century BC. The terracotta army figures were made in workshops. The head, arms, legs and torsos were created separately and then assembled. Studies show that eight face moulds were most likely used. Once put together, features such as facial expressions were added. It is thought their legs were made the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were made at the time. This would make it an assembly line production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting one solid piece and subsequently firing it. In those times, each workshop had to write its name on items produced. Once they were completed, the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty. = = = Outer planet = = = The outer planets are planets in the Solar System that are beyond the asteroid belt.

It has segmented ridges branching alternately to the right and left from a midline. The genus "Charnia" was named after Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, England, where the first fossilised specimen was found. Significance. "Charnia" is a highly significant fossil for several reasons. It is the first fossil ever described from undoubted Precambrian rocks. Until then the Precambrian was thought to have no fossils. Similar fossils found in the 1930s (Namibia) and the 1940s (Australia) but were thought to be of Cambrian age. Secondly, "Charnia" has become an enduring image of Precambrian animals. Originally interpreted as an alga (Ford), it was recast as a sea pen, a sister group to the modern soft corals, from 1966 onwards (Glaessner). The sea pen interpretation has recently been discredited. The current "state of the art" is something of a "statement of ignorance". Ecology. Little is known of the ecology of "Charnia". It was benthic, anchored to the sea floor. It probably lived in deep waters, below the waves (perhaps a great deal below the wave base). This means it did not photosynthesise. Further, it has no obvious feeding apparatus (mouth, gut, etc.) and so its lifestyle is somewhat of an enigma. Some think it survived by filter feeding or directly absorbing nutrients. The growth and development of the Ediacara biota is also important. It was used to discredit the sea pen hypothesis. In contrast to the sea pens (that grow by new buds at the base), "Charnia" grew by new buds at the apex. Distribution. "Charnia" is, in time and geography, the most widespread Ediacaran fossil. The greatest abundance of specimens, which are also the oldest reliably dated Ediacaran fossils, are found at Mistaken Point on Newfoundland. Diversity. Three species, "C. masoni", "C. wardi", and "C. antecedens", have different length/width ratios and attachments of adjacent branches. "Charnia masoni" was found by Roger Mason, a schoolboy who later became a professor of metamorphic petrology, in 1957. Tina Negus, a 15 year old schoolgirl at the time, had seen this fossil a year previously, but her geography schoolteacher flatly denied the possibility of Precambrian fossils. "Charnia wardi", later discovered in 1978 in southeast Newfoundland, was first described in 2003. This is the longest surviving Ediacaran age fossil, lasting over 2 million years. The holotype is a fragmentary specimen with a "C. masoni" like structure. It was defined as a new species on the basis of long and narrow shape. "Charnia antecedens" has more irregular and higher angles of branching than "C. masoni". A number of Ediacaran form taxa are thought to represent "Charnia" (or "Charniodiscus") at varying levels of decay. = = = Institute of Space and Astronautical Science = = = or ISAS, is a Japanese national research organization. ISAS studies astrophysics using rockets and satellites. ISAS is part of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). History. The ISAS began at the University of Tokyo in the 1955.

It is a preschool education institution, part of a child's education. Nurseries take care of young children during the day while providing a safe, fun and educational environment. Most nurseries provide toys and a outdoor playground with equipment. Names. Nursery "kindergarten" (children's garden), is a name given by Friedrich Fröbel, who created the Nurseru in Germany, in 1837. Other common names are "pre-school", "playschool" and "playgroup". The German word Kindergarten is also used in many non-English-speaking countries to denote a form of pre-school education. However, in the United States, Canada, and some parts of Australia, "kindergarten" is instead the term used to describe the first year of compulsory schooling. The word "kindergarten" is not generally used in the UK. United Kingdom. In the UK, most children start nursery at two or three years old and move on to primary school the academic year they turn five. Some nurseries can take care of babies as young as 3-6 months old. These nurseries are often called day nurseries or daycares. Some nurseries are called children’s centres. Some nurseries have separate rooms for different age groups. Preschools in the UK are mainly designed for children from toddler age to five years. Increasing the number of nurseries in England is part of the plan of the Government to get more women to get jobs. Working parents of three and four-year-olds in England are eligible for 30 hours of free childcare per week. Parents of 2-year-olds can get 15 hours free childcare if they get means-tested benefits or if the child is disabled. The rules are slightly different in Wales and Scotland. Jeremy Hunt announced plans to let more parents get free places in March 2023, but since then nurseries have found it difficult to get people to work for them and more than 3000 have closed. It may cost £2,000 a month for a full-time place. = = = Kingsway, London = = = Kingsway is a major road in central London in the United Kingdom, designated as part of the A4200.

Together Kingsway and Aldwych form one of the major north-south routes through central London linking the ancient east-west routes of High Holborn and Strand. History. The road was built as part of a redevelopment of the area in the 1900s. Its route cleared away the maze of small streets in Holborn such as Little Queen Street and the surrounding dwellings. However Holy Trinity Church, which was built in Little Queen Street was spared. Whereas the Sardinian Embassy Chapel, an important Roman Catholic church attached to the Embassy of the Kingdom of Sardinia, was demolished to make way for the new street. Plans were published by London County Council in 1898 and the road was formally opened in 1905. It is one of the broadest streets in central London at wide. It was unique in containing below it a tunnel for a tramway, which started just north of Southampton Row, passed beneath Aldwych and continued to the Thames Embankment: this Kingsway tramway subway joined the North and South London tram systems. In 1958 the disused tunnel was reopened at the southern end to make a new connection, the Strand Underpass, for light traffic between Waterloo Bridge and Kingsway on order to reduce congestion. Also beneath Kingsway was a branch of the Piccadilly tube line from Holborn to Aldwych. It is now closed with no service but the platform at Holborn used for the branch is used for TV and film sets that require underground scenes.

These tickets let people into a theater to see an event. In the movie industry, the term is most often used to mean the amount of money a movie makes by the selling of tickets. The term can also mean things which affect the amount a movie earns. Usage. "Box office" business can be measured in terms of how many people see a movie. It can also be measured by how much money is earned by selling tickets. The estimate of these amounts and analysis of them is very important to the movie industry. It is often something that is important to fans as well. Some people think that the movie industry is concerned too much with this. They say profit is more important to movie studios than making movies as a form of art. Understanding how different types of movies earn money affects the how other movies are made and paid for. If a certain type of movie often has a large box office, studios are more likely to make that type of movie. Some types of movies earn more when they are released at certain times of the year. Studios use this information to plan when to release certain movies. For example: There are many websites that show box-office number. Two of these are ShowBIZ Data and Box Office Mojo. Usually, the movie's distributor gets more than half of the money earned. The rest is kept by the movie theater. The percentage is different from movie to movie. The distributor often gets a higher percentage in early weeks. As time passes, the percentage become lower and the theater keeps a larger part of the ticket sales. With some movies, the distributor may take all of the ticket sales for the first week. The theater earns its money by selling food and drinks. After several weeks nearly all of the ticket sales is kept by the theater. Because of this, only the first few weeks are very important to the movie studios. Related movie industry terminology. The following is movie industry specific terminology. It is defined by Box Office Mojo. For movies released in North America, box office figures are usually divided into two categories. The first is domestic. This is the amount a movie earns in the United States and Canada. The second is foreign which includes all other countries. The Weekly box office is the amount a movie makes from Friday through Thursday. The "movie week" starts on Friday because most movies are released on that day. A large part of this is the weekend box office. It is defined as the amount earned on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The first weekend after a movie is released is the opening weekend. The amount made by a movie on its opening weekend is what is often reported. Theaters is the number of theaters in which the movie is being shown. Because a theater may show a movie on more than one screens, the total number of screens is also used. If a movie is released in over 600 theaters, it is said to be wide release. If the number is less than 600, it is a limited release. A limited release may be as small as one theater or 1-2 theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, California. A movie may start with a limited release and later get a wide release. "Little Miss Sunshine" is an example of this. = = = Labour (constituency) = = = The Labour is a functional constituency in the elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong first created in 1985.

It is on a sharp bend in the river, and links Battersea south of the river with Chelsea to the north. The first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge. Although a stone bridge was planned, a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead. Designed by Henry Holland, it was opened to pedestrians in November 1771, and to vehicles in 1772. The bridge was poorly designed. It was dangerous to its users and to passing shipping. Boats often collided with it. To reduce the dangers to shipping, two piers were removed, and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders. Although dangerous and unpopular, the bridge was the last surviving wooden bridge across the Thames in London. It was the subject of paintings by Turner, Cotman and Whistler. In 1879 the bridge was taken into public ownership, and in 1885 demolished and replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Joseph Bazalgette. It is the narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, and one of London's least busy Thames bridges. The position on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping, and it has been closed many times due to collisions. In June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames. The Battersea Bridge area marked the official start of the parade of ships and boats moving towards Tower Bridge. = = = Saint = = = A saint is a holy person. In many religions, saints are people who are believed to be sacred. In Christianity, the word "saint" refers to any person who is "in Christ", and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or in earth. Orthodox Christians and Catholics teach that all Christians in Heaven are saints, but some are worthy of more honor than others. In the Christian Bible, not only one person is actually called a saint: "They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD." () The apostle Paul called himself "less than the least of all saints" in . Paul's 2nd letter to the Corinthian Church speaks of ...all the saints in Achaia Also to the saints in Ephesus as well as to all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi General characteristics. Many religions use the "saint" idea to honor people, like Hindu saints. If a person is considered a saint, no matter what religion they belong to, they are usually: Christianity. Anglicanism. In the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement, a Saint is a person who has been elevated by popular opinion as a holy person. The saints are seen as models of holiness to be followed, and as a 'cloud of witnesses' that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey (). Official Anglican policy recognizes the existence of the saints in heaven. Eastern Orthodoxy. In the Eastern Orthodox Church a saint is defined as anyone who is in Heaven, whether recognized here on earth, or not. This means Adam and Eve, Moses, and the various prophets (except for the angels and archangels) are all given the title of "Saint". In the Orthodox Church, sainthood refers to closeness to God. Lutheranism. In the Lutheran Church, all Christians, whether in heaven or on earth, are regarded as saints. However, the church still recognizes and honors certain saints, including some saints honored by the Catholic Church. Methodism. While Methodists as a whole do not practice the patronage or veneration of saints, they do honor and admire them. Methodists believe that all Christians are saints, but mostly use the term to refer to biblical people, Christian leaders, and martyrs of the faith. Many Methodist churches are named after saints, such as the Twelve Apostles, John Wesley, etc. Mormons (Latter-day Saints). The beliefs within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with regard to saints are close to the beliefs of the Protestant faith. In the New Testament the saints are all those who have been baptized. "Latter-day" refers to the doctrine that members are living in the "latter days", before the Second Coming of Christ. Therefore members are often referred to as "Latter-day Saints" or "LDS", and among themselves as "Saints". Oriental Orthodox. The Syriac Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and Armenian Apostolic Church do accept the existence of saints, but officially recognize them in their own ways. For example, the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria canonizes saints, through the approval of that church's Holy Synod. A requirement of the Coptic Orthodox faith is that at least 50 years must pass from a saint's death to his canonization, and the Coptic Orthodox Pope must follow that rule. Other Christian groups. There are some groups who do not accept the idea of the Communion of Saints. Some believe all of the departed are in soul sleep until the final resurrection on Judgment Day. Others believe that the departed go to either Paradise or Tartarus, to await the day in which the living and the dead are judged. Certain groups do not believe that the departed have any connection with the living. Protestantism. In many Protestant churches, the word "saint" is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian. This is similar to Paul's numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible. In this way, anyone who is within the Body of Christ (any Christian) is a 'saint' because of their relationship with Christ Jesus. Many Protestants consider prayers to the saints to be idolatry because they believe prayers should be given only to God himself. Roman Catholicism. One Roman Catholic website says that "There are over 10,000 named saints and beatified people from history, the Roman Martyrology and Orthodox sources, but no definitive head count". Rev. Alban Butler published "Lives of the Saints" in 1756, containing 1,486 saints. The latest edition of this work contains the lives of 2,565 saints. Monsignor Robert Sarno, an official of Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, said it is impossible to say the exact number of saints. The Catholic Church teaches that it does not make anyone into a saint. Instead, it recognizes a saint. In the Church, the title of Saint refers to a person who has been canonized (officially recognized) by the Catholic Church, and is therefore believed to be in Heaven. Because the Church believes all people in Heaven are saints, there are many people believed to be in Heaven who have not been officially declared as saints. Sometimes the word "saint" is used to refer to Christians still living here on earth. The veneration of saints, in Latin, "cultus", or the "cult of the saints", describes devotion to a particular saint or saints. Sometimes this is called "worship", but only in the old-sense meaning "to honor or give respect". According to the Catholic Church, Divine Worship is properly reserved only for God and never to the saints. Saints can be asked for help, just as one can ask someone on earth to pray for them. A saint may be a patron saint of a cause or profession, or invoked against specific illnesses or disasters, sometimes by popular custom and sometimes by official statements of the Magisterium. Saints are not thought to have power of their own, but only that granted by God. Becoming a Saint. A person who is seen as very holy can be declared a saint by a formal process, called canonization. Formal canonization is a lengthy process often taking many years, even centuries. The first step in this process is an investigation of the candidate's life, undertaken by an expert. After this, the report on the candidate is given to the bishop of the area and more studying is done. It is then sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. If the application is approved, the person may be granted the title of "Venerable". Further investigations may lead to the candidate's beatification and given title of "Blessed". At least two important miracles are required to be formally declared a saint. These miracles must have happened after the candidate died. Finally, when all of this is done the Pope canonizes the saint. Once a person has been declared a saint, the body of the saint is considered holy. The remains of saints are called holy relics and are usually used in churches. Saints' personal belongings may also be used as relics. Some of the saints have a symbol that represents their life. Other religions. The word "saint" is not only used by Christianity. In many religions, there are people who have been recognized as having reached the highest goals of religious teaching. In English, the term saint is often used to translate this idea from many world religions. African Diaspora. Cuban Santería, Haitian Vodou, Brazilian Umbanda and Candomblé, and other similar syncretist religions adopted the Catholic saints, or at least the images of the saints, and applied their own spirits/deities to them. They are worshiped in churches (where they appear as saints) and in religious festivals, where they appear as the deities. The name "santería" was originally a negative term for those whose worship of saints deviated from Catholic norms. Buddhism. Buddhists hold the Arhats and Arahants in special esteem, as well as Bodhisattvas and Buddhas. Discordianism. In Discordianism, anyone, living or dead, or even anything can be named a saint. Anyone may canonize anything or anyone else as everyone, whether they are aware of it or not, is a pope in the POEE. This is because "moral perfection isn't necessary for Discordian Sainthood. You just have to suffer a lot." Hinduism. There are people who have been described as being Hindu saints, most of whom have also been more specifically identified by the terms Sant, Mahatma, Paramahamsa, or Swami, or with the titles "Sri" or "Srila". Islam. The Arabic word "wali" (Arabic ���, plural Awliyā' ������) is usually translated into English as "Saint". However, the "wali" should not be confused with the Christian tradition of sainthood. An important early scholar of Sunni Islamic beliefs, Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi, mentioned in his book "Al-Aqidah At-Tahawiya": "We do not prefer any of the saintly men among the Ummah over any of the Prophets but rather we say that any one of the Prophets is better than all the awliya' put together. We believe in what we know of Karamat, the marvels of the awliya' and in authentic stories about them from trustworthy sources. Unlike Prophets and Messengers, the "awliya" can be either male and female. One of the best known female saints is Rabi`a al-Adawiyya. It is widely regarded in Islam that the saints of saints is Ali Ibn Abi Talib the cousin of Muhammad all Sufi orders originate through his teachings. In addition all saints regard him as their champion 'The Saints of Saints' In Sufism, the major "wali" are considered to have been masters in the art of spiritual purification. Some groups within Islam hold the Hadrat (literally, Presence, a title of Sufi saints) in esteem. Judaism. The word "Tzadik" "righteous", and its associated meanings, developed in Rabbinic thought from its Talmudic contrast with "Hasid" ("Pious" honorific), to its exploration in Ethical literature, and its spiritualisation in Kabbalah. In Hasidic Judaism, the institution of the Tzadik assumed central importance. Sikhism. The concept of sant or bhagat is found in North Indian religious thought including Sikhism. Figures such as Kabir, Ravidas, Nanak, and others are widely regarded as belonging to the Sant tradition. Some of their mystical compositions are incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib. The term "Sant" is still sometimes loosely applied to living individuals in the Sikh and related communities. = = = Anne Bancroft = = = Anne Bancroft (September 17, 1931 – June 6, 2005) was an American actress.

One of the most well-known bits of popular wisdom in the English-speaking world is that apples and oranges cannot be compared. The ability to tell apples from oranges is learned. The phrase is almost always used along with a warning that things in different categories cannot be compared, or that the comparison is improper. History. This idiom began as a comparison of "apples and oysters" in a book of proverbs published in 1670. This idiom has become a marker in English-speaking culture. Idioms are a common stumbling block for learners of a language. Variants. The idiom is not uniquely English. In French-speaking Quebec, the idiom is "comparer des pommes avec des oranges" (to compare apples and oranges), In Europe, the French idiom is "comparer des pommes et des poires" (to compare apples and pears). In Latin America, the Spanish idiom is "comparar papas y boniatos" (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or "comparar peras con manzanas" (comparing pears and apples). In British English, the phrase "chalk and cheese" means the same thing as "apples and oranges". Comparison. In order to compare anything, there needs to be a theory to be proven and framework for testing the theory. Three basic questions come first: Scientific research. The idiom has inspired scientific research projects. For example, the "British Medical Journal" published a study of red delicious apples compared with navel oranges. They were found to have many similarities. There are differences in nutritional value. Experiments at NASA Ames Research Center showed that apples and oranges decay at similar rates. = = = Hardness = = = Hardness is a measure of how much a material resists changes in shape. Hard things resist pressure. Some examples of hard materials are diamond, boron carbide, quartz, tempered steel, ice, granite, concrete. Ability of material to resist wear, tear, scratching, abrasion cutting is called hardness. Harder materials are more difficult to cut and shape than softer ones. They are also usually more brittle which means they do not bend much but can shatter. Hard materials are used in cutting tools, machines and construction materials and other industrial goods. Hardness tests are important in materials science. The Mohs scale of mineral hardness tests the hardness of minerals. The Brinell scale and various compression tests and rebound tests are more used for metals and artificial materials. = = = Asia Pacific = = = Asia-Pacific or Asia Pacific (abbreviated as Asia-Pac, Asia Pac, Apac, APAC, APNIC, APJ, JAPA or JAPAC) is the part of the world in or near the Western Pacific Ocean.

Darwin had intended it as a section of "The Descent of Man". However, that book was already quite long: it was published in two volumes. So the "Expression of the Emotions" was published separately in 1872. The book is about the way emotional life is shown by the faces and actions of man and other mammals. Darwin sets out ideas that our systems of emotions are inherited, and have evolved in a similar way to the more familiar structural aspects of man and animals. He explores the origins of such human characteristics as the lifting of the eyebrows in moments of surprise and the mental confusion which typically accompanies blushing. The book is very notable for being the first book to use photographs as the main way of showing scientific evidence. The field of study is now called "behavioural genetics". One line of evidence he uses is the way many different peoples in different parts of the world have similar facial and emotional reactions. Darwin's basic points were: a single origin for the entire human species, and universal human expressions. Also, there are obvious links between the way human emotions are shown and the way other mammals show their emotions. Our emotional displays are adapted from a more basic set of emotional displays common to many mammals. The emotional displays are inherited, automatic and are difficult to control with our conscious mind. They are operated by the more ancient unconscious mind. Modern research has shown that it is extremely difficult to avoid giving signs of our emotions. A German translation of "The Expression" appeared in 1872; Dutch and French versions followed in 1873 and 1874.

Hooker was one of the founders of geographical botany, and Charles Darwin's closest friend. He was Director of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, for twenty years, in succession to his father, William Jackson Hooker, and was awarded the highest honours of British science. Voyages. Antarctic 1839–1843. The expedition consisted of two ships, HMS "Erebus" and HMS "Terror"; it was the last major voyage of exploration made entirely under sail. Hooker was the youngest of the 128 man crew. He sailed on the "Erebus" and was assistant to the ship's surgeon, who was instructed to collect zoological and geological specimens. The ships travelled all over the southern oceans from South America to Australia and New Zealand. Hooker made plant collections at each location and while travelling drew these and specimens of algae and sea life pulled aboard using tow nets. After spending 5 months in the Antarctic they returned to resupply in Hobart, then went on to Sydney, and New Zealand. They left New Zealand to return to Antarctica. After spending 138 days at sea, and a collision between the "Erebus" and "Terror," they sailed to the Falkland Islands, to Tierra del Fuego, back to the Falklands and onward to their third sortie into the Antarctic. The ships arrived back in England on 4 September 1843; the voyage had been a success for Ross as it was the first to confirm the existence of the southern continent and chart much of its coastline. Himalayas and India 1847–1851. On 11 November 1847 Hooker left England for his three year long Himalayan expedition; he would be the first European to collect plants in the Himalayas. Hooker's expedition was based in Darjeeling. Hooker wrote to Darwin relaying to him the habits of animals in India, and collected plants in Bengal. Hooker and a sizable party of local assistants departed for eastern Nepal on 27 October 1848. They travelled north west along Nepal's passes into Tibet. In April 1849 he started on a longer expedition into Sikkim, but he was imprisoned by the Dewan of Sikkim when they were travelling towards Tibet. A British team was sent to negotiate: they were released without bloodshed. Hooker returned to Darjeeling where he spent January and February 1850 writing his journals, replacing specimens lost during his detention and planning a journey for his last year in India. Hooker's survey of hitherto unexplored regions, the "Himalayan Journals" was published in 1854. Palestine 1860. This trip was taken in the autumn of 1860, with Daniel Hanbury. They visited and collected in Syria and Palestine; no full-length report was published, but a number of papers were written. Hooker recognised three phytogeograpical divisions: Western Syria and Palestine; Eastern Syria and Palestine; Middle and Upper mountain regions of Syria. Morocco 1871. Hooker visited Morocco from April to June 1871, in the company of John Ball, George Maw and a young gardener from Kew, called Crump. Western United States 1877. This was undertaken with his friend Asa Gray, the leading American botanist of the day. "A difficult question was why in the great mountain chains of the Western United States there appeared to be only a few botanical enclaves of plants of eastern-Asiatic affinities among plants of Mexican and more southern types." Hooker was back in Kew with 1,000 dried specimens by October. Some idea of the delights he encountered (trivia from his journal &amp; letters): His views on the flora of Colorado and Utah: There are two temperate, and two cold or mountain floras, viz: 1. a prairie flora derived from the eastward; 2. a so-called desert and saline flora derived from the west; 3. a subalpine; 4. an alpine flora, the two latter of widely different origin, and in one sense proper to the Rocky Mountain ranges. Darwin and evolution. While on the "Erebus", Hooker had read proofs of Charles Darwin's "The Voyage of the Beagle" provided by Charles Lyell and had been very impressed by Darwin's skill as a naturalist. They had met once, before the Antarctic voyage started. After Hooker's return to England, he was approached by Darwin who invited him to classify the plants that Darwin had collected in South America and the Galápagos Islands. Hooker agreed and the pair began a life-long friendship. On 11 January 1844 Darwin mentioned to Hooker his early ideas on the evolution and natural selection, and Hooker showed interest. In 1847 he agreed to read Darwin's "Essay" explaining the theory, and responded with notes giving Darwin calm critical feedback. Their correspondence continued throughout the development of Darwin's theory and in 1858 Darwin wrote that Hooker was "the one living soul from whom I have constantly received sympathy". Richard Freeman wrote: "Hooker was Charles Darwin's greatest friend and confidant". Certainly they had extensive correspondence, and they also met face-to-face (Hooker visiting Darwin). Hooker and Lyell were the two people Darwin consulted (by letter) when Wallace's famous letter arrived at Down House, enclosing his paper on natural selection. Hooker was instrumental in creating the device whereby the Wallace paper was accompanied by Darwin's notes and his letter to Asa Gray (showing his prior realization of natural selection) in a presentation to the Linnean Society. Hooker was the one who formally presented this material to the Linnean Society meeting in 1858. In 1859 the author of "The Origin of Species" recorded his indebtedness to Hooker's wide knowledge and balanced judgment. In December 1859, Hooker published the "Introductory Essay to the Flora Tasmaniae", the final part of the Botany of the Antarctic Voyage. It was in this essay (which appeared just one month after the publication of Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species"), that Hooker announced his support for the theory of evolution by natural selection, thus becoming the first recognised man of science to publicly back Darwin. At the historic debate on evolution held at the Oxford on 30 June 1860, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, Benjamin Brodie and Robert FitzRoy spoke against Darwin's theory, and Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley defended it. According to Hooker's own account, it was he and not Huxley who delivered the most effective reply to Wilberforce's arguments. Hooker acted as president of the British Association at its Norwich meeting of 1868, when his address was remarkable for its championship of Darwinian theories. Hooker was a close friend of Thomas Henry Huxley, a member of the X-Club (which dominated the Royal Society in the 1870s and early 1880s), and the first of the three X-Clubbers in succession to become President of the Royal Society. Kew. By his travels and his publications, Hooker built up a high scientific reputation at home. In 1855 he was appointed Assistant-Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and in 1865 he succeeded his father as Director, holding the post for twenty years. Under the Hookers, the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew rose to world renown. At the age of thirty, Hooker was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1873 he was chosen as its President (until 1877). He received three of its medals: the Royal Medal in 1854, the Copley Medal in 1887 and the Darwin Medal in 1892. He continued to intersperse work at Kew with foreign exploration and collecting. His journeys to Palestine, Morocco and the United States all produced valuable information and specimens for Kew. = = = Joseph Hooker = = = Joseph Hooker (1814 – 1879) was a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He fought Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville, when Hooker's much larger army was defeated. After the battle, he was replaced by George G. Meade before the Battle of Gettysburg. = = = Uremia = = = Uremia is a Greek word used in English to describe the condition of a person's blood. Uremia is caused by urine products building up in the blood. If those come over the normal filtration system of the kidneys then the condition is called uremia. People with chronic renal disease or acute renal failure are usually affected by uremia. = = = Ballets Russes = = = The Ballets Russes were a company of ballet dancers whose full title was "Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev". They became extremely famous in Europe in the early part of the 20th century. The group was formed and directed by the Russian Sergei Diaghilev. The Ballets Russes had more influence on ballet and ballet music than any other ballet company of their time. The dancers were from Russia, but the group travelled throughout Europe, spending a lot of their time based in Paris. Stravinsky was one of the many composers who wrote ballet music for them. Sergei Diaghilev was an impresario who was extremely good at spotting good dancers and helping them to rise to great standards. He had very good taste in art and music and inspired some great composers to write music for his dancers. He got some of the most famous painters of his time to make set designs for his productions. History of the ballet group. The group was started in 1909. By 1911 they had become a group who toured regularly. Many of the dancers had come from the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. They adapted the productions from the Mariinsky Theatre, performing ballets such as "Prince Igor", "Cleopatra" and "Le Festin" and "Les Sylphides". During the World War I they were cut off from any contact with Russia. During these years they experimented with many new ideas. Productions such as "Les Biches" and "Le Train Bleu" were about the fashionable society around them. At the same time the company also had productions which reflected Russian folklore, Greek legends and the Orient. Their fame continued after the war. When Diaghilev died suddenly in 1929 the Ballets Russes broke up and the dancers moved to other companies. Some of them formed the "Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo", who travelled to America and influenced dancing there. The choreographers. The company worked with several very famous choreographers such as Marius Petipa, Michel Fokine, Vaslav Nijinsky, Leonide Massine, and the young George Balanchine. Nijinsky’s dances reflect the art movement called Expressionism. Many of his new ideas could be seen in "L'Apres-midi d'un Faune" and "The Rite of Spring". Dancers. The Ballets Russes had many famous dancers. Many of them were from the Russian Imperial Theatres and they came to dance for Ballets Russes during the summer months. Some of the great dancers include Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, Olga Spessivtzeva, Mathilde Kschessinska, Ida Rubinstein, Bronislava Nijinska, Lydia Lopokova and Alicia Markova. The company was particularly influential because they treated male dancers as important. Up until this time the female dancers had much more attention than the male dancers. Among the male dancers were Michel Fokine, Serge Lifar, Léonide Massine, George Balanchine, Adolphe Bolm, and, especially, Vaslav Nijinsky who became the greatest dancer of his time. Music. The most famous music composed for Ballets Russes was that by the composer Igor Stravinsky. His ballets include "The Firebird", "Petrouchka", "The Rite of Spring", "Les Noces" and "Apollon musagète". The first time that "The Rite of Spring" was performed many in the audience hated it and booed and started to fight. Others thought it was brilliant. Stravinsky's music was original and shocking, and Nijinsky's choreography went beyond classical ballet technique. The audience found it difficult to understand the music and dance. They were used to the romantic music and classical ballet of the nineteenth century. Diaghilev also used music which had already been composed. This included music by Debussy, Ravel, Darius Milhaud, Prokofiev and other famous composers of the time. Set and costume design. The artists and designers who worked for the ballet included some of the 20th century's most famous names. Picasso, Bakst, Braque, Matisse, Coco Chanel, Miró, Dali, and Utrillo were some of the best-known. = = = Impresario = = = An Impresario is somebody who organizes concerts, operas, ballets or plays.

However, energy affects mass while time passes; therefore, it affects spacetime, so it has mass. = = = Sergei Diaghilev = = = Sergei Pavlovich Diaghilev (also known as Serge), (Russia, 31 March 1872 – 19 August 1929) was a Russian art critic, patron and ballet impresario. He formed a ballet company called "Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev". It has been called the greatest ballet company of all time. For twenty years, between 1909 and 1929, they were the most famous ballet company in the world. Many of their ideas influenced art and music as well as dance. Diaghilev got some of the world's greatest painters to design sets for his productions, and some great composers, including Igor Stravinsky, to compose music for the ballets. His dancers included the legendary Nijinsky and the Imperial prima ballerina Karsavina; also Pavlova, Danilova and Spessivtseva. His choreographers included Fokine, Nijinska, Massine and Balanchine; his composers included Stravinsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Prokofiev, Ravel and Debussy; his set designers included Picasso, Cezanne, Matisse, Utrillo, Bakst and Braque; Cocteau worked as an artist and wrote scenarios. The ballets created and the performances changed the course of ballet history. Diaghilev's gift lay in spotting talent, and bringing great artists to work together. He also persuaded patrons to support the "Ballets Russes". The production costs were enormous, and were not always covered by the ticket prices. The repertoire (list) of new ballets and new music grew, and the productions were not always successful. Diaghilev's company folded soon after his death, though many of the group worked together in new companies. Diaghilev was homosexual. He died of diabetes. = = = Bedford, Massachusetts = = = Bedford is a town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. It is in the Greater Boston area, north-west of the city of Boston.

He was very important for the intellectual and political culture of the last fifty years. His wife was historian Gertrude Himmelfarb. They had two children; including Chief of Staff to Vice President Bill Kristol. In July 2002, he received from President George W. Bush the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.

By its population and economic activity, it is the second-most important city in the country, after Santo Domingo. History. Christopher Columbus built a small fort in the summer of 1495, on the northern side of the Yaque del Norte river in a place named "La Emboscada". This is several kilometres to the west of the present city. Columbus named the fort after "Santiago Apóstol", in English "Saint James" In 1504, Nicolás de Ovando, governor of the Hispaniola, moved the town to Jacagua which is now the municipal district of San Francisco de Jacagua. This place was near the mountains and away from the river Yaque del Norte. An earthquake destroyed the city of Santiago on 2 December 1562. The next year, 1563, the city was rebuilt again on the north side of the river Yaque del Norte but this time more to the east, where it is now. This new town was called "Santiago de los Caballeros", in English, "Saint James of the Knights" or, better, "Knights of Saint James". Population. The city had, in , a total population of 591,985: 288,746 men and 303,239 women. The urban population was of the total population. The people from this city are called (demonym) in different ways; "santiaguero" for males and "santiaguera" for females. Sometimes "santiagués" is used for both sexes. "Santiaguense" (for both sexes) is used to differentiate them from people of other cities with the same name in Spain, Cuba, Chile, and Argentina. Geography. The municipality of Santiago de los Caballeros has a total area of . It has five municipal districts (a municipal district is a subdivision of a municipality). These are Pedro García, Baitoa, La Canela, San Francisco de Jacagua and Hato del Valle. Santiago de los Caballeros is at to the northwest of Santo Domingo and at an altitude of above sea level. The municipality has the municipalities of Tamboril and Licey al Medio to the east, the La Vega province to the southeast, the municipality of Jánico to the south, the municipality of San José de las Matas to the southwest, the Valverde province to the west, the municipalities of Bisonó and Villa González to the northwest and the province of Puerto Plata to the north.

In Britannia, as in other provinces, the Romans constructed a network of paved trunk roads to (surfaced highways). In their nearly four centuries of occupation (43 – 410 AD) they built about 2,000 miles of Roman roads in Britain. They are shown on the Ordnance Survey's "Map of Roman Britain". This is the most accurate and up-to-date layout of certain and probable routes that is available to the general public. The pre-Roman Britons used unpaved trackways, including ancient ones running along the ridges of hills, such as the South Downs Way, now a public long-distance footpath. In contrast, most of the Roman network was surveyed and built from scratch, with the aim of connecting key points by the most direct possible route. The roads were all paved, to permit heavy freight-wagons to be used in all seasons and weather. Most of the known network was complete by 180 AD. Its main purpose was to allow the rapid movement of troops and military supplies. It was also vital for trade and the transport of goods. Roman roads remained in use as trunk roads for centuries after the Romans withdrew from Britain in 410 AD. Systematic construction of paved highways did not resume in England until the 18th century. Construction of Roman roads. The Romans became expert at constructing roads, which they called "viae". It was permitted to walk or drive cattle, vehicles, or traffic of any description along the road. The "viae" differed from the many other smaller or rougher roads, bridle-paths, drifts, and tracks. By law, the minimum width of a "via" was fixed at 2.4 m where it was straight, and 4.9 m where it turned. The best sources of information as regards the construction of a regulation "via munita" are: After the civil engineer looked over the site of the proposed road and determined roughly where it should go, the "agrimensores" went to work surveying the road bed. They used two main devices, the rod and a device called a "groma", which helped them obtain right angles. The rod men put down a line of rods called the "rigor". A surveyor looked along the rods and told the "gromatici" to move them as required. Using the "gromae" they then laid out a grid on the plan of the road. The "libratores" then began their work using ploughs and, sometimes with the help of legionaries, with spades dug down to bed rock or at least to the firmest ground they could find. The excavation was called the "fossa", "ditch". The depth varied according to terrain. In top-quality roads, there were five layers, plus footpaths and kerbstones: The method varied according to place, materials available and terrain, but the plan was always the same. The roadbed was layered. The road was constructed by filling the ditch. This was done by layering rock over other stones. Into the "fossa" was dumped large amounts of rubble, gravel and stone, whatever fill was available. Sometimes a layer of sand was put down, if it could be found. When it came to within 1 yd (1 m) or so of the surface it was covered with gravel and tamped down, a process called "pavire", or "pavimentare". The flat surface was then the "pavimentum". It could be used as the road, or additional layers could be constructed. A "statumen" or "foundation" of flat stones set in cement might support the additional layers. The final steps used concrete, which the Romans had rediscovered (it had been used in Ancient Egypt). They seem to have mixed the mortar and the stones in the fossa. First a small layer of coarse concrete, the "rudus", then a little layer of fine concrete, the nucleus, went onto the pavement or "statumen". Into or onto the nucleus went a course of polygonal or square paving stones, called the "summa crusta". The "crusta" was crowned for drainage. An example is found in an early basalt road by the Temple of Saturn on the Clivus Capitolinus. It had travertine paving, polygonal basalt blocks, concrete bedding (substituted for the gravel), and a rain-water gutter. = = = Cam'ron = = = Cameron Giles (born February 4, 1976 in Harlem, New York) is an American rapper better known by his stage names Cam'ron or Killa Cam.

Though there are taco trucks all over the world, they are most often seen in Los Angeles and other Mexican-American cities. In many cities, such as Los Angeles, regular restaurants have tried to shut down taco trucks. This is because taco trucks sell food at a lower price than many restaurants. Taco trucks have been criticized in the past for being dirty and unhealthy, but this is not the case anymore. Chicago is the only city in the United States which does not allow cooking on food trucks but Taquero Fusion, Chicago's Original Taco Truck, managed to figure out a way to provide gourmet tacos to their customers.

They are mainly found in warm bodies of water in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. The Silky shark is large, slim, and grows up to a maximum length of 3.3 metres (10 feet). The Silky shark gets its name from the fact that it has a smooth, "silky" texture. The Silky shark feeds on bony fish such as tuna, mackerel, sardines, and mullets, and molluscs such as squid and paper nautilus. They have also been known to feed on the bodies of dead whales. The Silky shark is classified as "Near Threatened" by the IUCN. Description. A large, slim shark, the Silky shark has a fairly stretched, rounded snout, a relatively slanting first dorsal fin with a blunt top that is located behind the edges of the pectoral fins, a small second dorsal fin with an extremely long free rear tip (more than two times the height), and a low inter-dorsal ridge (ridge between the dorsal fins). The pectoral fins are long and slim, and have dusky coloured tips. Silky sharks are normally dark grey with a shade of bronze, but are sometimes a golden-brown colour. Their undersides are white. Except for the first dorsal fin, the tips of all the fins are a dusky colour; this is more visible among the young. The upper teeth are widely triangular and slanted, becoming more diagonal toward the angle of the jaws which are strongly cut and heavily jagged on the sides. The lower teeth are raised with smooth edges. There is usually 1 to 2 symphysial teeth on both, the lower and upper jaw. The dermal denticles are small, tightly packed and over-lapping, giving the hide a smooth or "silky" texture, giving the shark it's name. The maximum length for this species is 3.3 metres (10 feet). Males mature at the lengths of 2.2-2.3 metres (9–10 years of age) and grow to a lesser size than females, which reach maturity at the lengths 2.3-2.5 metres (12 years of age), however, these numbers are different among the different populations of this species. Silky sharks weigh around 350 kilograms (770 pounds). Taxonomy. The first specimen described was given the name "Carcharias (Prionodon) falciformis" by Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle in 1841. The genus name "Carcharhinus" comes from the Greek words "karcharos" which means "sharpen", and "rhinos" which means "nose". Other names given to the Silky shark are "Squalus" or "Prionodon tiburo", "Gymnorhinus" or "Gymnorrhinus pharaonis", "Aprionodon sitankaiensis", "Carcharhinus floridanus", "Eulamia malpeloensis", and "Carcharhinus atrodorsus". Habitat. The Silky shark is common in tropical and subtropical waters, and is found in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. In the western Atlantic, it ranges from the U.S state Massachusetts to Brazil (including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea), and in the east it ranges from Spain to Angola. It is found in the western Indian Ocean and the Red Sea from Tanzania to Mozambique, including Madagascar and the Comores, and in the middle and eastern Indian Ocean in ranges from the Maldives and Sri Lanka to western Australia. It is found from China to New Zealand in the western Pacific (including the Hawaiian Islands), and Baja California to Peru in the eastern Pacific. Although the Silky shark is mainly found in the pelagic zone, the Silky shark is not just found in the open ocean, but has also been recorded from depths as shallow as 18 meters (56 ft). It is an active, swift shark that prefers warmer waters (about 23 °C). It is commonly found near the edges of continental shelves and over deep water reefs where there is a large amount of food source. It mainly ranges from the surface down to at least 500 meters (1,550 ft) but has been caught over water as deep as 4000 meters (12,400 ft). Studies show that groups of Silky sharks contain Silky sharks of different genders, but of the same size. Young Silky sharks can be found in coastal nurseries and adults are found further offshore, over deeper waters. Feeding. The Silky shark feeds mainly on bony fish such as tuna, mackerel, sardines, mullets, groupers, snappers, sea chubs, sea catfish, eels, lanternfish, filefish, triggerfish, and porcupinefish. It's diet also includes squid, paper nautilus, and swimming crabs, and there is fossil evidence of it scavenging on dead whales. Since of their good sense of hearing, and hunting tactics, these sharks are excellent hunters. They usually work together to "herd" groups of small fish to the surface, trapping the fish. When the fish are all tightly packed together, the Silky sharks attack the fish with great speed, and often consume the whole group of fish. Reproduction. The Silky shark is viviparous, meaning that it gives live birth. In the western north Atlantic, females mate in the late spring (May-June), and give birth in the same time period, but in the next year, meaning that the gestation period lasts 12 months. The number of pups per litter is 6-14 in the western Atlantic, 9-12 in the eastern Atlantic, 9-14 in the western Indian Ocean, and 2-11 in the central Indian. The young spend their first few months in coral reefs, but move to the open ocean by the first winter. In the western north Atlantic, nursery areas are located along the Caribbean islands. Other names. In English, the Silky shark is also called the "Net-eater shark" in the eastern Pacific because of the fact that it is often caught in nets used for fishing tuna. The Silky shark is also called the "Blackspot shark", "Grey whaler shark", "Olive shark", "Reef shark", "Ridgeback shark", "Sickle shark", "Sickle silk shark", and "Sickle-shaped shark". In other languages, the Silky shark is called the "cação" (Portuguese), "cazon" (Spanish), "cazon de playa" (Spanish), "cazón-tiburón" (Spanish), "haukkahai" (Finnish), "jaqueta" (Spanish), "jaqueton" (Spanish), "kanhaai" (Dutch), "karcharinos lios" (Greek), "kurotogarizame" (Japanese), "lombo preto" (Portuguese), "malie" (Samoan), "mandi sravu" (Malay), "mangeur d'hommes" (French), "marracho sedoso" (Portuguese), "marracho-luzidio" (Portuguese), "mbamba menyo" (Swahili), "moosi" (Gujarati), "mungsing" (Javanese), "mushi" (Marathi), "papa" (Swahili), "papa bunshu" (Swahili), "pating" (Tagalog), "requin soyeux" (French), "seidenhai" (German), "suga sura" (Telugu), "syhaai" (Afrikaans), "tiburón" (Spanish), "tiburon jaqueton" (Spanish), "tiburón lustroso" (Spanish), "tiburón sedoso" (Spanish), "tinterero" (Spanish), "tollo" (Spanish), "tollo mantequero" (Spanish), "tribon berde" (Papiamento), "tubarão-luzidio" (Portuguese), "yu jereh" (Malay), "yu pasir" (Malay), and "zijdehaai" (Dutch). Human interaction. Silky sharks are considered dangerous to humans because of their aggressive nature and size. Silky sharks have been observed with their head raised, back arched and tail lowered, a posture believed to be a form of threat display. Silky sharks are important to longline and gillnet fisheries in many parts of the world. In the Gulf of Mexico they are often caught with tuna catches, but are also caught by shark fishery. In the Caribbean they are sometimes fished, usually by longline, but they are not a common catch. In the Maldives and Sri Lanka, they are the most important shark species, making up 70-80% of the catches made in the pelagic zone. In Japanese waters, Silky sharks are a common target species of the shark fishery and are also caught with swordfish and tuna fisheries. In the mid-Atlantic waters of the U.S.A, the Silky shark is fished on a limited basis, but not in significant numbers. The meat, oil, and fins of the Silky shark are sold commercially. The Silky shark is also fished by recreational fishermen. Like other sharks, the Silky shark is in danger due to overfishing, because of its long gestation period, low number of offspring, and slow growth rate. Other than its importance to various fisheries, Silky sharks have been used in various scientific studies to investigate the sensory biology of sharks. = = = Hairpin turn = = = A hairpin turn (also hairpin bend, hairpin corner, or just hairpin), is a very tight corner. It makes a vehicle turn almost 180° to continue on the road. It gets its name from the way it looks like a hairpin or bobby pin. Hairpin turns may be called switchbacks in American English. Hairpin turns may be built when a road or path climbs up or down a steep slope. This allows the path to travel the slope with a smaller slope. Hairpin turns may be used in race tracks to slow down the race cars after a long, fast straight. = = = Sepang International Circuit = = = The Sepang International Circuit (SIC) is a racing circuit in Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia. It is near the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, about 60 km south of the capital city Kuala Lumpur. It is the venue used for the Formula One Malaysian Grand Prix, A1 Grand Prix as well as the Malaysian MotoGP. The circuit was designed by German designer Hermann Tilke. Layout. The main circuit is 5.54 km long. It is raced in a clockwise direction. It is noted for its sweeping corners and wide straights. The layout is unusual, with a very long back straight separated from the pit straight by just one very tight hairpin corner. The circuit may be set-up with other configurations. The north circuit is the first half of the main circuit. The course turns back towards the pit straight after turn 6 and is 2.71 km long. The south circuit is the other half of the circuit. The back straight of the main circuit becomes the pit straight. It joins onto turn 8 of the main circuit to form a hairpin turn. This circuit is 2.61 km in length. Sepang International Circuit also features kart racing and motocross facilities. = = = Phoronida = = = The Phoronida, or horseshoe worms, are a small phylum of marine animals. There are twenty species, in two genera. They are part of the Brachiozoa, which also includes the brachiopods. Phoronids are worm-shaped, but with a gut that loops and exits the body near the mouth. That explains the name 'horseshoe worms'. They are found in all oceans and seas (except the polar seas), and all species have wide geographical ranges. They occur at depths up to 400 metres, but mainly between 0 to 70 metres. The life span is thought to be about a year. The adults are tube worms, and secrete chitinous tubes in which they live. These tubes can be buried in the mud or sand or rest on the surface of a rocky substrate. If on rocks, they may live in colonies with their tubes become twisted around each other for support. Some species can dissolve away holes in rocks such as limestone, calcareous seashells or even cement piers; they then live in these holes which they line with their secreted tubes. They feed using a lophophore, a ciliated structure that surrounds the mouth. Together with the Bryozoa and Brachiopoda, the phoronids belong to the lophophorates, sometimes treated as a single phylum. Anatomy. Though they are normally long, up to 50cm (30 in). Phoronids are normally very thin. The digestive tract of Phoronids consists of a short oesophagus which leads into a spherical stomach and then into the intestines which end in the anus. Phoronids have a simple blood system of one descending artery and ascending vein linked by a network of fine capillaries. There are also blood vessels into each of the tentacles. The blood is colourless but contains corpuscles with a haemoglobin-like pigment that helps to carry oxygen. The nervous system is mainly composed by the nervous ganglion between mouth and anus, a ring nerve at the basis of the lophophore, one or two giant nerve fibres which issue from the ganglion and extend along the body wall. There are two tubular excretory organs, which discharge to the exterior via nephridiopores, on the anal papilla. Reproduction. Phoronids may be hermaphrodites or single sexed, and may also reproduce asexually. Gametes are released through the nephridia. Fertilisation is probably internal. Phoronids follow one of two types of reproductive strategy. Some species, such as "Phoronis ovalis", lay only a few (12–25) large eggs which have a lot of yolk. These eggs are brooded within the adult's tube, they are released only when they have hatched. The second strategy is to lay a much larger number (up to 500) of smaller eggs. These eggs are released as soon as they are fertilised. They hatch a few days later into what is called an 'actinotrocha' larvae. The larvae undergo a planktonic development for 2–3 weeks, and settle after about 20 days. Metamorphosis is 'catastrophic', occurring in less than 30 minutes and leading to a slender young phoronid. Phoronids can regenerate the lophophore if it becomes damaged, in fact "Phoronis ovalis" voluntarily loses its lophophore in order to lay its eggs. Once the eggs are laid the animal grows a new lophophore. Feeding. Phoronids are suspension-feeders. They move their lophophores into the prevailing water current. Food particles in the water current are trapped in a stream of mucous that travels along the tentacles until it reaches the oral ring. There it is drawn into the mouth and then on into the digestive tract. Direct uptake of amino acids through the epidermis also occurs. Fossils. The fossil record of phoronids is poor. There are borings dating back to the Devonian which have been attributed to phoronids. "Iotuba chengjiangensis", a form known from only three specimens in the Lower Cambrian, has been interpreted as a phoronid because it appears to have had a U-shaped gut and was tentaculated. Phoronids may be related to the common but mysterious tubular fossils known as hederellids. = = = Shanghai International Circuit = = = The Shanghai International Circuit is a Chinese motor racing venue. It is in the district of Jiading near Shanghai in the People's Republic of China. It was the venue of the first Formula One Chinese Grand Prix on 26 September 2004. History. The circuit costing about $450 million (USD). It was paid for by a government-funded joint-venture company. This company was made up of the Shanghai Juss Corporation, Shanghai National Property Management Co Ltd, and Shanghai Jia'an Investment and Development Co Ltd. Architectural and design experts began visiting the site by April 2003. The site was transformed from swampland to an international racetrack in 18 months. A team of 3000 worked around the clock to finish the construction. Other events held at the circuit include a round of the MotoGP world championship, the Australian-based V8 Supercar championship, and also the final round of the A1 Grand Prix in 2006 and 2007. The 2008 MotoGP race was the last one at Shanghai International Circuit. The FIM didn't select the circuit for 2009 because of overcrowding problems. Layout. Like many new Formula One circuits, Shanghai International Circuit was designed by Hermann Tilke. It features his trademark track feature: a long back straight followed by a hairpin turn. Current-generation F1 cars can easily exceed on the long straight between corners 13 and 14. The track layout was inspired from the Chinese character shang (�). Shang is the first character in the name of the city Shanghai, and means "above" or "ascend". = = = Endeavour River National Park = = = The Endeavour River National Park is just north of Cooktown, Queensland, Australia. It protects the north banks of the Endeavour River. Both the river and the park are named after Captain James Cook's ship, HM Bark Endeavour. The ship was repaired in the river in 1770 after being damaged by coral on the Great Barrier Reef. Most of the park can only be reached by boat. There are no facilities in the park, and people are not allowed to camp there. The park covers an area of about 2400 hectares. It is next to the Cairns Marine Park and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The Endeavour River protects a number of different habitats including, coastal dunes, fresh water wetlands, river estuary, mangrove forests, heathland and tropical woodlands. = = = Nobuko Yoshiya = = = was a Japanese novelist. She wrote during the Taishō and Showa periods of Japan. She was one of modern Japan's most successful writers. She wrote many romance novels and adolescent girls’ fiction. She was also one of the first writers of Japanese lesbian books, including the Class S genre. Early life. Yoshiya was born in Niigata Prefecture, but grew up in the cities of Mooka and Tochigi, in Tochigi Prefecture. Her father was in the public service, so her family often moved. She was the only daughter and youngest child of her family. Both, her mother and her father, came from samurai families. She started writing when she was in her teens, although before this she had developed a love for writing which sapped her time for learning domestic skills from her mother. = = = Radioisotope heater unit = = = A radioisotope heater unit is a device that provides heat from the breakdown of radioactive material. Radioactive material is added to a container within the heater. Because the material is unstable, it breaks down, releasing energy as heat. The heater may be packaged with a thermocouple to make electricity. = = = Circuit de Catalunya = = = The Circuit de Catalunya is a racetrack in Montmeló, to the north of Barcelona, Catalonia. It is home to the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix and the motorcycle Catalonia Grand Prix. With long straights and a variety of corners, the Circuit de Catalunya is seen as an all-rounder circuit. It is often used for off-season testing. History. The Circuit de Catalunya was built in 1991. It was planned to host its first race in 1992 to go with the Olympic Games. The Olympic Games were scheduled to take place in Barcelona. The circuit is often referred to as 'Barcelona' in the racing community, even though it is located in Montmeló. The Circuit de Catalunya should not be confused with the Montjuïc circuit, which hosted the Spanish Grand Prix four times between 1969 and 1975. Unlike the Circuit de Catalunya, Montjuïc circuit is actually located within the city of Barcelona. Because of so much testing is done at this circuit, Formula One drivers and mechanics are extremely familiar with it. This has led to criticism that drivers and mechanics are too familiar with Catalunya, reducing the amount of on-track action. When the circuit opened, overtaking was frequent. Cars could closely follow each other through the last two corners. They would slipstream down the long straight for a pass. As aerodynamic balance became more important, this overtaking method became less effective. The cars were unable to follow each other as close. They would encounter turbulence created by the leading car. This made it hard for a car to get close enough to pass. In the next to the last corner was replaced with a chicane. This was an effort to improve passing. The redesign did not increase the amount of overtaking. The Circuit de Catalunya also plays host to many other racing series, including Moto GP. The chicane which was put in for Formula 1 does not exist in the track layout for Moto GP, and there are at least five points on the track where riders are known to pass. As in Formula 1, turn one is the most popular place for overtaking. = = = Juan Manuel Santos = = = Juan Manuel Santos Calderón (born 10 August 1951) is a Colombian politician. He became the President of Colombia on 7 August 2010. Santos replaces Álvaro Uribe as president. Santos has distanced himself from Uribe. Santos intends work on the social need of the country. He also wants to improve relations Colombia's neighbors. Since winning the presidency in a June 20 landslide, Santos has marked distance between himself and Uribe, signaling the arrival of a leader who, unlike his predecessor, intends to focus on a social agenda and the country's frayed relations with its neighbors. During his inauguration speech, he said "I will preside over a government of national unity that will bring social prosperity for all Colombians... If we want to have economic and social development, we need to build unity among us." Santos was schooled in the United States and is familiar with technology. He was a defense minister in the Uribe government. Santos has become well known around the world for trying to end the long conflict in Colombia. In 2016, after a lot of negotiations, he announced a peace deal with the FARC militia, which has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. By June 2016, a peace deal had been reached, and some people have said Santos and the other negotiators may win a Nobel Peace Prize if the peace deal holds. Uribe is against the deal, which he thinks is too easy on FARC. He is 65 years old, and is from one of the most politically influential families of Colombia. He is married to Maria and has three children. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 He left office on 7 August 2018 and was replaced by conservative Iván Duque Márquez. = = = Ross Island = = = Ross Island is an island which was formed by four volcanoes in the Ross Sea, which can be found near the continent, Antarctica. Geography. Because of the persistent presence of the ice sheet, the island is sometimes mistaken to be a part of Antarctica. Its area is 2,460 km2 (950 sq mi); only a small portion of the island is free of ice and snow. The planet's southernmost active volcano, Erebus (3794 m), as well as the dormant volcano Terror (3230 m), are situated on the island. They were named by Ross after his ships HMS "Erebus" and HMS "Terror". The third highest peak is Mount Bird, and on its slopes are Shell Glacier and Endeavour Piedmont Glacier. Abbott Peak stands between Mount Erebus and Mount Bird. Despite its relatively small size, Ross Island is the world's 6th highest island. Discovery. The island was discovered by Sir James Clark Ross in 1841, and it was later named in his honour by Robert F. Scott. Ross Island was the base for many of the early expeditions to Antarctica. It was and still is the southernmost island reachable by sea. Huts built by Scott's and Shackleton's expeditions are still located on the island, preserved as historical sites. Today Ross Island is home to New Zealand's Scott Base, and the largest Antarctic settlement, the U.S. Antarctic Program's McMurdo Station. Greenpeace established World Park Base on the island and it ran for five years, from 1987 to 1992. Claims. Ross Island lies within the boundaries of Ross Dependency, which is claimed by New Zealand. Wildlife. Ross Island supports a colony of about a half million (500 000) Adélie Penguins. = = = Excretion = = = Excretion is one of the most basic functions of life. It is the process of eliminating waste products of metabolism and other non-useful materials. It is an essential process in all forms of life. It contrasts with secretion, where the substance may have specific tasks after leaving the cell. In single-celled organisms, waste products are discharged directly through the surface of the cell. Multicellular organisms use more complex methods. Higher plants eliminate gases through the stomata on the surface of leaves. Animals have special excretory organs. Mammalian excretion. In mammals, excretion is the formation of urine in the kidneys, and expelling carbon dioxide from the lungs. These waste products are eliminated by urination and breathing out respectively. If excretion does not occur in an organism, waste products accumulate, which eventually kill the organism. Also, food waste is expelled through the anus. Other substances are secreted into the bile, and then eliminated in the faeces. The skin and lungs also have excretory functions: the skin eliminates metabolic wastes like urea and lactic acid through sweating,p395 and the lungs expel carbon dioxide. Other vertebrates. Aquatic animals usually excrete ammonia directly into the water, as this compound is soluble and there is ample water available for dilution. In terrestrial animals ammonia-like compounds are converted into other nitrogenous materials as there is less water in the environment, and ammonia itself is toxic. Reptiles and birds excrete their nitrogenous wastes as uric acid in the form of a white paste. This allows efficient water retention and it can be stored more easily in the egg. Both uric acid and faeces are expelled through a common opening called the cloaca. Their waste is usually two-coloured: part white (uric acid) and part green or black (organic waste). Many bird species, especially seabirds, can also excrete salt via specialized nasal salt glands, the saline solution leaving through nostrils in the beak. = = = Vibration isolation = = = Vibration isolation is a system of devices to decouple a mechanical or structural object from its vibrating supports. For example, the handles of the saw presented in the right photo are separated from the engine and cutting bar to reduce shaking for the operator. Here, the spring mount is a part of this vibration isolation system. When the targeted object is rather heavy (e.g. building, bridge or the like), vibration isolation may be called base isolation. Vibration isolation is a branch of protective techniques known as vibration control. History. From the very beginning, the theory of vibration isolation, in general, and of base isolation, in particular, rested on two pillars: "heavy damping" and "frequency separation". Unfortunately, nobody paid any attention that the heavy damping was a sort of a strong connection between a "substructure" and "superstructure", and that the idea of decoupling them with the help of such connections was of no good. = = = Murder of Megan Kanka = = = Megan Nicole Kanka (December 7, 1986 – July 29, 1994) was an American child who was raped and murdered by her neighbor Jesse Timmendequas. It happened in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey by a convicted sex offender, when she was seven years old. Timmendequas tricked Kanka to come into his house by saying he had a puppy inside. Once Kanka noticed there was no puppy Timmendequas raped her, slammed her head into a dresser, wrapped her head in a plastic bag, and strangled her with a belt. He put her body in his car and assaulted her once more before placing her in a toy chest and dumping it in a park in nearby West Windsor, New Jersey. When he went to court the jury sentenced him to death after convicting him of kidnapping, rape, sodomy and murder. The aftermath of this led the New Jersey Legislature to pass a law called "Megan's Law" which requires convicted sex offenders to tell the local police department when they move into a neighborhood. = = = Ueno Station = = = Ueno Station () is a railway station of JR East and Tokyo Metro in Taitō, Tokyo, Japan.

They are not directly supported by an automobile manufacturer. Privateer teams often build and maintain their own vehicles. In the early years of Formula One, privately-owned teams would race using a race car built by another team or constructor. Many privateer entrants compete for the enjoyment of the sport, and are not paid to be racing drivers. The modern F1 Concorde Agreement now requires teams to build their own cars. In modern F1 terms, privateer is more often used to refer to a team who are not at least part-owned by large corporations, such as WilliamsF1. = = = Factory-backed = = = Factory-backed is a term commonly used in motor sports to describe a racing team with support from a manufacturer. This support includes financial aid. Motor sports is an expensive pastime, and some amount of factory support is often necessary for success. Full factory backing is often seen in the top levels of competition. = = = Meriwether Lewis = = = Meriwether Lewis (August 18, 1774 – October 11, 1809) was an American explorer, soldier, and public administrator. He was best known for his role as the leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with William Clark. Their mission was to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase, establish trade and sovereignty over the natives near the Missouri River, and claim the Pacific Northwest and Oregon Country for the United States before European nations. They also collected scientific data, and information on indigenous nations. President Thomas Jefferson appointed him Governor of Upper Louisiana in 1806. He died of gunshot wounds in what was an act of suicide. = = = William Clark = = = William Clark (August 1, 1770 – September 1, 1838) was an American explorer, soldier, Indian agent, and territorial governor. A native of Virginia, he grew up in prestatehood Kentucky before later settling in what became the state of Missouri. Clark was a planter and slaveholder. Along with Meriwether Lewis, Clark led the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1803 to 1806 across the Louisiana Purchase to the Pacific Ocean, and claimed the Pacific Northwest for the United States. Before the expedition, he served in a militia and the United States Army. Afterward, he served in a militia and as governor of the Missouri Territory. From 1822 until his death in 1838 (aged 68) he served as Superintendent of Indian Affairs. = = = Concorde Agreement = = = The Concorde Agreement is a contract between the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the Formula One teams and the Formula One Administration. The Concorde Agreement defines the agreement about how the teams race, and how the money is divided up. The money includes the television revenue and prize money. There have been six Concorde Agreements since 1981. The terms of all of the agreements have been kept a secret. The secrecy was broken by racing journalist Forrest Bond when the 1997 Concorde Agreement was published in 2006 by RaceFax. The basic requirements of the agreements are to be professional and to increase the success of Formula One. The biggest requirement of the teams to participate in every race. This makes Formula One better for the broadcasters. Broadcasters spend a large amount of money to televise the races. In return for racing, the teams were guaranteed a percentage of the sport's revenue. Background. The Commission Sportive Internationale, was an organization that reported to the FIA. They were the rule-making group for Formula One. In 1979 they were replaced by the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile, or FISA. The race teams were represented by the Formula One Constructors Association, or FOCA. At the time, FOCA's chief executive was Bernie Ecclestone and his legal advisor was Max Mosley. FISA and FOCA had a number of disagreements. Some teams believed that FISA was favoring the major manufacturers. The teams were also unhappy about how the money in Formula One was being distributed. First Concorde Agreement (1981). The FISA and FOCA disagreements became known as the FISA-FOCA war. This resulted in several races being canceled. Goodyear threatened to quit suppling tyres to Formula One. This would have been a disaster to the sport. Bernie Ecclestone of FOCA organized a meeting of team managers and FISA representatives. The meeting was held at the offices of the FIA in the Place de la Concorde, Paris, France. At the meeting, they negotiated for thirteen straight hours. On 19 January 1981, the first Concorde Agreement was signed. The agreement was named after the plaza in Paris where the discussions took place. The contract terms remain mostly confidential. It is known that teams were required to appear and compete in every race. This would ensure that the newly acquired television public that they would have a race to watch. The agreement also granted FOCA the right to televise Formula One races. This may have been the most important part of the agreement. This right was "leased" to Formula One Promotions and Administration, a company created and owned by Bernie Ecclestone. Another important part of the agreement was that the rules would be kept stable. The first Concorde Agreement expired on 31 December 1987. Second Concorde Agreement (1987). The second Concorde Agreement covered the through seasons. Third Concorde Agreement (1992). The third Concorde Agreement covered the through seasons. Fourth Concorde Agreement (1997). In 1995 the FIA decided to transfer Formula One's commercial rights from FOCA to Formula One Administration for a 14-year period. In exchange, Ecclestone would make an annual payment. McLaren, Williams, and Tyrrell did not like this arrangement. They rejecting the proposed Concorde Agreement. Ken Tyrrell was upset that Ecclestone, as President of FOCA, had transfer the rights to his own company. Mr. Tyrrell also did not like that the Agreement was secret. He believed that only helped Ecclestone. He felt it weakened the bargaining power of the teams. On 5 September 1996 the new Concorde Agreement was signed by all the teams except McLaren, Williams, and Tyrrell. The agreement was to run from 1 January 1997 to 2002. Fifth Concorde Agreement (1998). Taking a stand against Bernie Ecclestone, the FIA, and the commercial aspects of Formula One put McLaren, Williams, and Tyrrell in a bind. The three teams lost influence in the sport and income they would have received if they had signed. A compromise (agreement between all parties) was reached. On 27 August 1998, the 1998 Concorde Agreement was signed. This agreement expired on 31 December 2007. Sixth Concorde Agreement (2009). A meeting on the new Concorde Agreement was held on 7 December 2004. All of the teams but Ferrari attended the meeting. Ecclestone offered a payment of £260,000,000 over three years if all the teams would renew of the Concorde Agreement. On 19 January 2005, Ferrari announced that it had signed an extension to the 1997 Concorde Agreement. The extension would expire on 31 December 2012. Later that year, Red Bull and Jordan/Midland also signed an extension. (Jordan had been sold to Midland, but was still racing under the name Jordan.) On 7 December, 2005, Williams became the fourth team to sign an extension to the agreement. On 27 March 2006, the five GPMA-backed teams (Jaguar, Honda, Ferrari, Toyota, and Renault) submitted their applications for the 2008 season. On 14 May 2006, the five GPMA-backed teams signed a Memorandum of Understanding (a letter agreeing to the terms) with the commercial rights holders (CVC/Ecclestone). This formed the basis of the next Concorde Agreement. A full Concorde Agreement was not in place for the season, with the Memorandum and other individual teams acting as a temporary solution. On 29 July 2008, the ten currently competing teams created the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) to negotiate the terms of contract. After a dispute between FOTA and the FIA in the first half of 2009, a new Concorde Agreement was signed by Mosley and all of the teams except BMW Sauber. BMW Sauber had announced it was going to withdraw from Formula One at the end of the season. The new agreement provides for a continuation of the terms of the 1998 agreement. It runs until 31 December 2012. A program of resource limits was also agreed on. Revised sporting and technical regulations for the season were set. = = = Tokyopop = = = Tokyopop, formerly known as Mixx, is an American distributor, licensor and publisher.

As of January 1, 1990, the Roerich Pact had been ratified by ten nations: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, the United States, and Venezuela. It went into effect on 26 August 1935. The government of India approved the treaty in 1948 but did not take any further formal action. The Roerich Pact is also known as "Pax Cultura" ("Cultural Peace" or "Peace through Culture"). The most important part of the Roerich Pact is the legal recognition that the protection of culture is always more important than any military necessity. Nicholas Roerich. The Russian painter and philosopher Nicholas Roerich (1874-1947) started the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects, in order for a “Peace of Civilizations”. Roerich was born on October 9, 1874, in St. Petersburg, Russia. He became a successful painter, and one of his paintings was purchased by Tsar Nicholas II. After 1918, Roerich left Russia. In 1923, the Roerich Museum was founded in New York and is now in Manhattan at the corner of 107th Street and Riverside Drive. Finally, Roerich settled down in the Kulu Valley in Himachal Pradesh in the Himalayas. He died on December 13, 1947. In 1929, Roerich, working with Paris University professor Giorge Chklaver, wrote a draft of an international treaty dedicated to protection of cultural values (Roerich Pact). US President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a decisive influence on the process of signing of the treaty by all nations of the American continent. Incidentally, Roosevelt kept in his private rooms a bust of Roerich. The Roerich Pact was the basis for the United Nations “International Convention for Protection of Cultural Values in the Event of Armed Conflict” signed in 1954. However, not all of the ideas of the Roerich Pact are fully implemented in international law, especially the preference of the preservation of cultural values over military necessity. Banner of Peace. The Roerich Pact proposed a flag to identify protected objects, the Banner of Peace, which was a white cloth containing a red ring and three red circles inscribed in it. The sign symbolized a unity of the past, present, and future into the ring of eternity. Ideas from the Pact were reflected in Roerich's art. The Banner of Peace symbol is shown in many of his paintings. Importance in 21st century. The Roerich Pact is an international treaty, but it also contains legal ideas about a new type of state. The state budget should include money spent on culture, art and education that must be larger than military expenses. That is the legal recognition that the protection of cultural objects is more important than any military necessity. Roerich thought that caring for future generations was an important reason for constitutional states to exist. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the speech upon the signature of the Roerich Pact, said, "In opening this Pact to the adherence of the Nations of the world, we are endeavoring to make of universal application one of the principles vital to the preservation of modern civilization. This Treaty possesses a spiritual significance far deeper than the text of the instrument itself." The Roerich Pact was an important step towards the future development of a new legal culture. The provisions of Roerich’s concept are based on the idea that the primary duty of the state is to preserve the national culture. The ideas of the Roerich Pact are still not fully implemented in international law. Some people think that the 21st century is the time to implement his ideas. = = = M. Night Shyamalan = = = Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan (; �����‌ ������������ ��������‍, Mitur Ben Es-Derti ,Latin English: "Maṉōj Nelliyāṯṯu Ṣiyāmaḷaṉ", born 6 August 1970), known professionally as M.

The distinction dates to the 17th century, but its modern application is due to publications by Sun Lutang, dating to the period of 1915 to 1928. Nèi jìng is developed by using "nèigōng", or "internal exercises," as opposed to "wài gōng", "external exercises." Nèijiā is a broad term used mistakenly in the West as a synonym for the more specific Wǔdāngquán styles, named for their association with the Taoist monasteries of Wudangshan range, Hubei Province in Chinese popular legend. These styles are enumerated by Sun Lutang as Tàijíquán, Xíngyìquán and Bāguàzhǎng, but must also include Bājíquán and the legendary Wudang Sword. Some other Chinese arts, not in the Wudangquan group, such as Liuhebafa, Bak Mei Pai, Bok Foo Pai and Yiquan are frequently classified (or classify themselves) as "internal". = = = Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada) = = = The Brahmajala Sutta is the first of 34 suttas in the Digha Nikaya (the Long Discourses of the Buddha). The name comes from 'brahma' (perfect wisdom) and 'jala' (net-which-embraced-all-views). The sutta is also called 'Atthajala' (Net of Essence), Dhammajala, (Net of the Dhamma), Ditthijala (Net of Views), Anuttarasangama Vijaya (Incomparable Victory in Battle). The sutta discusses two main topics: the elaboration of the Ten Precepts (Cula-sila), the Middle Precepts (Majjhima-sila), and the Great Precepts (Maha-sila). Cula-sila deals with the Ten Precepts to be practised by devout buddhists, while Majjhima-sila gives a detailed description of the practice of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth precepts, together with the practise of plant conservation and speech etiquette. The second and third parts of the sutta discuss the 62 beliefs (ditthi) or "views" held by ascetics in the Ganges plains ( in what is now India) during the life of the Buddha. These are divided into: 18 beliefs related to the past (pubbantanuditthino), and 44 beliefs about the future (aparantakappika). Many of these beliefs are still relevant in the modern world and thus the sutta provides Buddhist scholars with much information to ponder about the Buddha's teachings. The elaboration of these beliefs is very detailed, focusing on how the beliefs (faiths) come to be and the way they are described and declared. The elaboration ends with the Buddha's statement about the danger of clinging to these beliefs, as they are still influenced by desire (lobha), hatred (dosa), and ignorance (moha) that its faithful followers will not end in the final liberation but still in the cycle of samsara. Believers of these faiths are compared to small fish in a pond which will be captured by a fine net no matter how much they want to escape, while those who see reality as it is are beyond the net of samsara. = = = Baguazhang = = = Bāguàzhǎng is one of the major Chinese martial arts of the Wudang school.

B: Well, I, you know, in terms of, in terms of any sorts of trends I, you know, B: obviously things are different from, for me than, and my children than when I was growing up. A: Yeah. B: I, I, I grew up on a farm, uh, in Iowa, B: and, uh, you know the whole family was around the, the whole time. B: And then what my father did was, was, uh, you know, obvious to me B: and I, I helped out with it. B: But, uh, although I have brought my boys into to see where I work, it's not that easy, B: and it's, it's certainly not at all common, B: and they, they just don't really have that same idea, A: Right. B: so they, uh, B: it's a, it's a whole different, uh, kind of thing there then, uh, A: My husband has taken us to work with him, A: and we still don't know what he does. B: Yeah. A: So, we just say he travels a lot. A: So, that kind of covers it. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Well, that makes it hard though for in terms of, you know, family time with, with him. A: Yes. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I've been lucky in that respect that I don't, uh, don't travel too much . A: He's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months. B: Oh. A: Yes. B: Yeah. A: So those are the real killers. A: If he's just gone, B: Yes. A: he's gone three weeks right now A: and that's, that's mild compare to the big ones, B: Yeah. A: so we just, you know. I just do the carpooling and, and handle whatever needs to be done. A: And something major, always needs to be done. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: So you just have to, to handle it until he gets home B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: right. A: And hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home. B: Well, let's see. A: So what, So what gets you? B: As far as I'm , B: Well, the thing I think that annoys me the most is, I have, I have young children, a baby in the house B: and, and inevitably as soon as they're asleep, someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something. A: Uh-huh. B: And I think that, that is probably the most aggravating A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, you know, it invades my time. B: I'm the one that pays for the phone. B: Uh, if I want to buy something, I'll take the initiative and, and go find it, you know. B: And that just really does aggravate me. B: Uh, what do you think? A: Well, I mean I, A: that's exactly the kind of thing I would have said. A: Although in my case it's my wife and I both work, A: we come home A: and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings A: and it's one solicitation call after another A: and, you know. B: Your time is, is valuable, A: Yeah, A: it's, it's like you say, very annoying B: and, A: and, uh, why, why do we let this happen. B: Oh, I, B: that's, that's interesting. B: I B: the, the market seems to just be growing, too. B: I, I guess enough people are not speaking out. B: I'm not speaking out, that's for sure. B: I just get aggravated about it. B: And, A: Would, would you, A: I mean if you could legislate something, what would you legislate? B: I really don't know. B: I'm, I'm not into uh, heavy government legislating of a lot of different areas, B: but I I don't know. B: I just, I do particularly find it annoying. B: Uh, I'm really not sure. to be, A: Yeah. A: It, it seems, it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that. *sv B: Well, that, yeah, that might, A: And the people making these calls would be obliged to compare the, their lists that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called. B: Identify themselves, yeah. B: Right. B: Well, that would be a good an interesting way, A: Uh, B: yeah. A: And, that, that way, those who want it can have it A: and those who don't want it, don't have to have it. B: Right. A: Sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself. B: Right, B: you're, A: Except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers. Uh, automatically B: Oh, is that right? B: Oh, that's interesting. A: and, B: And they just get everybody. A: Right. B: Oh, boy. B: Well, I, I do wish that it would stop on my end because it, it seems to happen at the worst possible moments. A: Yeah. B: And I, I guess the next one is, is door-to-door solicitors. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't mind the children when they're selling things for school. B: I have kids B: and, you know, that's just kind of part of it A: Yeah B: but when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning uh, that really, it makes you not feel particularly safe A: Uh-huh. A: Yes. B: and, it's annoying as well. A: And these, and these people may in fact be just looking to find an unoccupied house to rob. B: Right, B: you just, you really don't know, B: so I, I find myself being a a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than than I might normally be A: Uh-huh. B: but, I do feel like it's a, an invasion of my space. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, B: I've never quite understood the purpose of that. B: Yeah, B: I, uh, A: Well, I think these people were hired by, from, from different sources. B: Just A: Uh, with, you know, A: and so, therefore, there's no one answer. A: But, but, yeah A: sometimes it's a market basically it's a market survey B: Just a survey. A: but they never say who, who they're really working for or what you know, what what, what questions are, you know, B: Yeah. B: There have been a couple of times when the, the, uh, whatever the subject was, I guess caught my interest and I went along with it B: and then there have been several times when I just said, well, I just really don't have the time, you know to deal with it at that moment. A: Yeah A: Yeah. B: But, uh, I don't get too many of those. A: Yeah B: I've had just a few. A: Yeah B: Uh, generally someone's trying to sell me something B: or, A: Right, A: well, and sometimes that's, this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too. B: Right, B: right. A: Other times it's, you know, wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose. B: Right. A: For which, if they would just pay me enough money I would be willing to consider. B: Yeah. B: That's right. A: But, but a dollar isn't it, A: you know, it's, B: Oh. A: Uh, and I also sort of worry that, you know, that sometimes people giveaway personal information. A: Uh, when, when the call comes and, and they, uh, you know, sort of seductive, to, you know, A: somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things, A: and so I start answering A: and then you, you know, you go down a path B: Right. A: uh, and you don't know where it's going to end. In fact, you don't even know what you've eventually, you know, the totality of what you've revealed *sv This isn't, you know, most likely not to, going to be used against you, B: Yeah. B: Well, we, B: That's true. A: but it could A: and, And that seems to be something that should, should really be outlawed. Because it's subject to abuse B: Yeah, B: you just never know, I guess. B: That, B: yeah, B: I, I, A: and it, B: Asking for information is, is, B: I can't really see that, B: I think they ought to, if, if nothing else, they ought to spend money for a postage stamp B: and, you know, when it arrives at your house, oh, I, A: Okay, A: what kind of house do you live in? B: Well, uh, we live in a, a brick home in far north Dallas B: and it's, uh, four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back B: and, It's about thirty-five hundred square feet. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, it sounds like ours are pretty similar. A: I live in one, A: I don't have a swimming pool. A: And mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot. B: Yeah. A: But the four bedrooms A: and all the rest of it sounds just about about alike. A: I think it's pretty much typical for this area. B: It is. B: Have you been living there very long? A: I've been in the house A: I'm in here right now about twelve and a half years. B: So you've been there longer. B: We built this one about, uh, B: it's been let's see it's been six years six and a half years ago, A: Uh-huh. B: and we subcontracted it out ourselves. B: We bought the lot and, uh, had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications A: Oh, really? A: Uh-huh. B: and then we subbed it out, B: so, we've been here a little over six years now. And uh, have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, I bet you, A: Uh-huh. B: My husband got his big garage. B: He we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in A: Uh-huh. B: and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines B: and, so he has all the work space he needs. A: Well, that sounds interesting. A: I bet he's enjoyed having it that way B: He, A: because A: kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications. B: It is, B: and that's why we decided to build. B: We looked at things that were already, uh, built A: Uh-huh. B: and the garages were always, if the house was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have. A: Well, then, most of them don't have a three car garage. B: Uh-huh. A: They're kind of rare. B: So we put a three car garage in. A: Uh-huh. B: But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space. B: All of it was taken up with just car space. A: Uh-huh. B: And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on. A: Uh-huh. A: Well that, A: my, we've just got a two car garage, A: but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything. B: Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests. A: Now, mine does not work on cars, A: he just piddles on this and that. B: Oh, I see. A: But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his, his piddling things. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, that's nice that it's not in your house. A: It really is. B: Uh-huh. A: Because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own, A: and I, you know, I wouldn't mind having, A: and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff, B: Uh-huh. A: but I, someone, A: I don't know, A: it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something. B: Right. A: So I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would. B: Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come home. A: Uh-huh. B: And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come. B: His parents come B: and also the kids have friends who come and stay A: Uh-huh. B: and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, I still, A: all three of my daughters are married, A: but, I don't know, A: I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time. And some of them coming back home and things, you know. B: Right. B: Oh, I understand A: And we've got
