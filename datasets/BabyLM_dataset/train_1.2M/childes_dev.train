I thought you were already gone on a picnic? *CHI: but mom we wanna go with the aliens. *CHI: and we decided to ask for your permission. *CHI: they're very nice. *CHI: and you'd like them. *CHI: so the parents said I told you you could go on a picnic. *CHI: but I don't believe any of this alien stuff. *CHI: and Marsha and Tim said we can prove it come on. *CHI: so the parents are like okay. *CHI: so they all went to the grassy field to have a picnic. *CHI: but when they were there the aliens weren't there anymore. *CHI: Marsha and Tim go they were right here wait. *CHI: and so then they see um the little baby girl alien who's siting on the ground crying. *CHI: and then Marsha and Tim go what's wrong? *CHI: and she goes my mommy and daddy they went without me. *CHI: and so Marsha and Tim get so worried. *CHI: and they start running as fast as they can. *CHI: and Marsha's pointing up in the sky to where their u f os were running. *CHI: they're yelling wait, wait, wait. *CHI: then all of a sudden Marsha has an idea. *CHI: she grabbed the rock and throws it at the bottom of the spaceship. *CHI: then they notice there's something. *CHI: so they stick their heads out the window. *CHI: and they go wait you forgot your little baby. *CHI: and then the mom's like oh no you hafta turn around, not my little Zoe. *CHI: so they fly back and go to get their little baby. *CHI: and then Marsha and Tim go why did you decide to leave? *CHI: they're like well we got a call that um my father's in the hospital. *CHI: we needta go back as soon as we can. *CHI: so then they wave goodbye. *CHI: and Marsha and Tim go we'll miss you. *CHI: and then when the aliens leave Marsha and Tim tell their parents see we told you. *CHI: and then the parents said maybe there are aliens. *CHI: but still that doesn't mean you should go off yelling about them. *CHI: they might get abducted. *CHI: and they seem like very nice people. *CHI: they're like can we write to them. *CHI: and their parents just started laughing and laughing. *CHI: and so it ends up that every other sunday Marsha and Tim would go back to the grassy field and have a picnic with the aliens. = = =

so he hadta go and find another pair of shoelaces as quick as he could. *CHI: but then when he went to look for them he couldn't find any shoelaces. *CHI: so he hadta take his brother's shoes which didn't quite fit him. *CHI: so his toe was almost sticking out of the end. *CHI: then by the time he got all his stuff together he went to go to the school bus. *CHI: and the school bus had left. *CHI: so he was chasing the school bus to school. *CHI: and he fell in a mud puddle. *CHI: so he was all dirty when he went to school. *CHI: and his teacher said Jiminey why are you late? *CHI: and he
