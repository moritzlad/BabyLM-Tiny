it, A: but I decided that I don't like grass, A: I don't like to have to have to pull grass B: Uh-huh. A: so I decided that I would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot and see how it worked. B: Uh-huh. A: And mine looks real good B: You know, I've seen a lot of people that do that. A: Yeah. B: I've seen, you know, like elderly people that really can't get out too much sometimes. A: Uh-huh. B: Like we, B: I have a great aunt that lives in a, B: it's just like, uh, a high rise for elderly people. B: And, you know, she does her own thing and everything, B: but she has, B: it's like a little apartment building. B: And she has a tomato plant year round. A: Oh. B: Because she, you know, B: they keep it warm with, for all the older people, B: and she keeps it year round. A: I had never thought about that. A: I could probably plant one and bring it in, and just like I bring my plants in every year. A: That'd be neat. A: Well, I got a patio, A: and I tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots And planting them all in it, you know, because that's favorite thing, is tomatoes to grow. B: Uh-huh. A: And so, um, but he said, No, A: he was going to plant in the earth, you know, like he always has, A: because he's always had a garden out in the country. B: Uh-huh. A: And I think he kind of misses it a little bit, you know, since we moved to the city. A: But, um, I went ahead and planted one, and mine looks better than his A: It does, A: and then I like, um, A: you know what day lilies are? B: Pardon me? A: Day lilies. B: Are they, well, B: do they just come out in the morning then go A: Uh-huh. B: but we call them Morning Glories up here. A: No, A: no. A: Huh-uh. A: These look like a lily. A: They look like a, a, well, they really look like an orchid when they come out. B: Oh really. A: Uh-huh. A: That what the look like, A: but they only bloom for one day. B: Oh. A: They'll, um, A: you'll have a bud the evening before, A: and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it, it it starts opening up A: and then when it gets dark, it closes A: and that's it. A: It only blooms for one day. B: And then it's done, completely done. A: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: Yeah. A: But, um, they look like orchids, is what they look like, A: but they look like different color ones, A: like I have, uh, yellow ones, A: and I have red ones, A: and I have purple ones B: Uh-huh. A: and then they have like, you know, the real velvety looking stuff inside B: Oh, yeah. A: it looks just like orchids in different colors. A: That's what they look like. B: Oh, really pretty. A: They are, they're beautiful. A: Uh, I have a friend when I lived out in the country, A: and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year, you know, or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with. B: Uh-huh. A: And I mean they were real expensive. A: They were like, well, A: the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty-two fifty for one bulb. B: Oh, my gosh. A: So what she would do is she would plant them, and they multiplied. A: So the next year when she, you know, weeded them out so they wouldn't be as thick, then she'd give me some of the bulbs. B: Uh-huh. A: And, I mean, I have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen. A: So, when we decided to move, it was really funny because, like I said, I had a whole bunch of different kinds of things, A: and I kept saying, Well, I want to take a few of these, and I want to take these, and I want to take these. A: My husband finally said, Look, are we going to take the grass? A: Can we leave the grass? A: I said, Yes, we may leave that. B: take the whole grass, the whole yard. A: And we had a tree that was like seventeen foot tall, or something like that, that he said, No, no, I am not taking the tree. A: You know, I mean, every time we went outside, he'd look at something that was humongous, you know, A: No, A: we're not taking that. A: But the last day, he said, Can't we leave the grass, A: and I said, Yeah, A: I think we will leave that. B: That'd be funny. A: But, I brought, A: my kids, when they were little they had given me some azaleas so I brought all my azalea bushes. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: And you know, I brought, I brought as much as I could bring without, you know, really tearing up their place. B: Uh-huh. A: But, just like, um, you know, A: the people that bought ours, bought the place, but, um, I knew that they would, you know, A: if I left like one bulb of each one of them, by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them. B: Yeah. A: So, it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something, you know, A: it would cover it right up. B: Uh-huh. A: But, I just couldn't see it, you know, going off and leaving everything like that. B: Yeah. A: Because this house, I really liked it and everything, but the yard was a lot to be desired. A: Oh there was nothing. B: Oh. A: These people, A: we have one ugly pine tree. A: I mean, and it is ugly. A: I even tried making it look nicer, you know, A: I tied the yellow ribbon around it, A: and it was so ugly. A: Oh, it did not help, let me tell you. A: I took it off and put it on my door. A: I did not want to call attention. A: I mean, it was terrible. A: So really the plants that I brought over and put out here are just about all. A: I don't do any of the mowing or, you know, edging and all that B: Uh-huh. A: My husband does all that stuff. A: But that's because I'm allergic to the grass. B: Oh, that'd be awful. B: I love going out in the Summer in the grass. A: Really. B: Uh-huh. A: Now I like to go to the beach where the sand is, A: because then it doesn't make me ill B: Yeah. B: And, um, well even up here at school, you know, it gets hot, and we have the windows open, B: well they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning. B: And just to smell the grass, it's just, B: I just love the smell of freshly cut grass. A: Yeah, A: I used to until it, I got so allergic to it. A: I don't know if it's all, well, A: I went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds I was allergic to. A: But it's not as bad here, A: like Saint Augustine, I think, is what we have. A: And it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country. B: Uh-huh. A: But out in the country, I mean, A: if I went outside while he was mowing the grass, I was going to have a gigantic attack. B: Oh my gosh. A: So, um, I get shots for it now, too. A: That helps a whole bunch. B: Uh-huh. A: But, one good thing about it, see I don't have to mow the grass A: or A: I mean, that's really nice. B: Yeah, B: you said that you had a garden. B: What all things do you plant in it, B: or do you like to plant in it? A: Well, the first thing we always plant is tomatoes B: Uh-huh. A: every year. A: I don't care if we don't have anything else, A: we're going to have tomatoes. A: And then we plant cucumbers A: and, B: Uh-huh, B: do your cucumbers come good? A: Oh yeah. B: Really. B: Sometimes when my dad has, like, B: that's the one thing no one is allowed to touch except my dad. B: He takes care of all the cucumbers, B: because he said the vines are just so, B: at our house, as soon as you touch a vine, it's like it completely dies. A: Really, B: Uh-huh. A: It must be the, uh, B: Sometimes we have really good luck with them, B: but then there'll be like maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything. A: Now that's, I mean, that's something that grows like a weed here. B: Oh, wow. A: I mean, it grows like a weed. A: We have to allow extra room for those, because, you know, I mean extra space, between the rows and all. B: Yeah B: because they take up a lot. A: Yes, A: but I mean, we usually get, I mean, just pulling them as fast as you can. B: Holy smoke. A: We usually give them to everybody. B: Uh-huh. A: Anybody that wants a cucumber can have it. A: But we tried it, too, where you run it up a fence B: Uh-huh. A: and, um, we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence. A: I mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other. B: Oh my gosh. A: I mean, it was, A: but they're so heavy, you know, A: they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down. A: But, I mean, cucumbers here grow like crazy. B: Wow. A: Of course it's real hot here too. B: Well, see, tomatoes grow like crazy at our house. B: Like we have a section of tomatoes, B: and we put the tomatoes there every year, in the same section. B: And I swear we get tomatoes six rows up. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: now if we have any, like the birds will pick or something, you know, A: and some of the seeds drop. A: Have you ever had them just come up in different places? B: Uh-huh. A: I know, we do that, too, you know, A: and at the first year, A: because I was from the city when we got married, A: and the first year that we planted, I couldn't figure out, I mean, the, A: well, the first year after I mean, we planted them, B: Uh-huh. A: but the first year, you know, after we'd had a crop all these little things like, B: Yeah. A: we had cucumbers coming up, you know, in the middle of our okra, A: and I thought, how did this get here B: Uh-huh. A: I know I didn't put that seed there. A: And it was weird, but the birds had, you know, evidently just deposited them for us. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, sometimes, too, when we take out our garbage, B: and we usually, you know, we just dump it in the middle of the garden, you know, after your garden's basically done A: Uh-huh. B: and we're finding out, B: like we have peach trees in the middle of our garden now, because we took peach seeds and dump them there, whenever the garden, B: like in the Fall, B: now we have peach trees coming up, A: All right, A: do you want to start out? B: Well, it'll be real easy for us, B: because we're both, my husband and I are vegetarians. A: Oh, are you really? B: So, yeah. B: So that's the first thing we look for, is if we can eat there or not. A: Oh. A: Are you strict vegetarians? B: We're not vegan vegetarians. B: We do, we're ovolacto. B: We do eat, uh, eggs and, and milk products. A: Uh-huh. B: I used to be a complete vegan vegetarian, where I didn't eat any animal products at all. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: But, um, it was, it's really difficult in the area if you don't have, you know, the products that you can get. B: And if you go out to dinner, there's virtually, you know, there's not a whole lot of things you can get. A: There's very few places that you, I'll bet that you could, uh, B: Yeah. B: I think maybe if you were somewhere like California, where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants and stuff. A: Uh-huh. B: But here, basically, you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant, you know, where you can get foods that, you know, where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the the corn meal, you know, or something. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: And you wouldn't have the meat products in that A: and some. A: Yeah. B: yeah, B: you have to watch that too. B: All, you know, some of the restaurants here they will, you know, B: you can ask them and they'll tell you whether or not they use like lard or, you know, animal fat to cook with. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: So, but, so that's, that B: we don't really eat out too much. A: Yeah. B: We, we tend to eat at home. B: And actually, you know, I think we, we, we get a we have a healthier diet than the average person. A: Uh-huh. A: How long have you been doing this? B: Um, I've been a vegetarian for, uh, two years now. B: My husband has been one for, oh, just over a year now. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, so, A: Do you feel that it has improved the way you feel? B: Definitely. A: Do you think? B: And it, it makes you more aware of what you're eating. A: Uh-huh. B: Because you, you have to be. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, you, you B: I think you, you, you balance the foods, uh, you know, B: you're more aware of what nutrient, you know, value each thing has, and minerals. A: Uh-huh. B: And you're just more aware of food for energy, for energy sake. A: Uh-huh. A: I always thought it would be hard to figure what to eat if you were a vegetarian. A: How, how, B: Well, that's just it, B: you, you do have to figure it out. And, and, you know, to get proteins and things. A: Yeah. B: And when I was a vegan, it's, you know, B: you have to consider calcium and iron and things like that you, you're not even getting through your milk products, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: your egg products. If you don't eat any of those, A: Because you don't eat any of those things. B: but actually you can get everything you need through vegetables. B: I mean, there are there are, there are, B: you actually you can get more calcium through leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products. A: Is that right? B: A lot of people don't know that. A: Uh-huh. B: Well, the thing is that milk products, B: our bodies don't, uh, don't, uh, B: the lactose, B: that kind of milk, it doesn't, A: Uh-huh. B: our, B: we, we tend to, uh, B: what's it called? B: We don't synthesize the, the calcium the same way. A: We, we throw more of it off our out, in other words. B: Yeah. B: We, we slough some of it, B: we, we send, we send some of it out because it, our body doesn't accept some of it. A: Uh-huh. B: So we're not utilizing, we're, B: when it, when it gets rid of some of that, um, that we can't use, it get rids, it gets rid of some of the calcium. Whereas when we eat, say broccoli, you utilize all of it. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: You B: your, your body accepts all of the broccoli. A: All that's in it. A: Uh-huh. B: So, it's like, it's like, say, a person using vitamins, as opposed to, uh, vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food. A: Why? A: Uh-huh. B: Your body just doesn't accept vitamins and the minerals in the, the vitamins in, uh, supplements that it does in regular food, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: you know. So, A: That's interesting. B: But we both, we both feel much healthier, much healthier. A: Uh-huh. B: And I couldn't consider going back to eating, A: After you have been on this. B: Yeah. B: Well, now I changed for ethical reasons. A: Uh-huh. B: And my husband has changed. B: He feels more ethically about it. B: But he, he in the beginning, began for health reasons. A: Uh-huh. B: But, um, now he, he feels like I do. B: That he looks at the things that he eats B: and he realizes what they are before he eats them. A: Uh-huh. B: And he, you know, A: Uh-huh. A: He thinks more about them, then. B: Yeah. B: Plus he eats, B: we both think more about, I thought more of about it as far as what it was I was eating, you know, as a living creature. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And now we both think a lot of well, what is it we're eating in relation to what it's going to give to our bodies. A: Uh-huh. A: So you kind of have a combination. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Well see, we, I live in a farming community. So, of course we have a lot of animals and that type of thing raised in our area. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, we do too. B: I mean, I was raised in, um, B: we're in cattle country. A: Uh-huh. B: And people here buy a half a cow and put it in their freezer, A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, yeah, A: yeah. B: you know. And that's, that's the way I, B: and I, B: believe you me it wasn't easy to give up to give up a hamburger. B: That, that was one of my favorite foods, was, was a, a, was a good steak or a hamburger. A: Uh-huh. B: But, you know, I suppose if you really believe in something it's, You, you adjust your life A: You get adjusted to the taste. A: Uh-huh. B: because your mind. A: Uh-huh. B: You, your, you, B: inside yourself you just, it's not right. A: Uh-huh. B: So, but, um, A: So you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining area than what most most people would. A: Now we wouldn't have that problem, because we're not vegetarians. B: So what do you look for when you, A: Uh, I think the main thing that I look for is, uh, cleanliness, uh, you know, the, in the appearance of the people that work there. And the, uh, quality of the food that they serve. B: Uh-huh. B: Do you normally, when you're traveling, do you look for places that's established, that, that you've been to before or are you willing to try new places? A: Yes. A: Oh, we try new places A: but when we, A: a lot of times we do eat where we know. B: Yeah. B: Like a chain restaurant or something. A: What, A: Uh-huh. A: What the quality, A: because a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, we do, do that a lot. A: And I guess I'm getting old, older, A: also I like to be served. A: I like to sit down and have my, uh, order taken. B: As opposed to like a cafeteria kind of situation? A: Right, A: yeah. B: Yeah. A: So, I suppose you'd say I, A: well I, I don't know whether it's age or what it is. A: But I have, B: Well no, B: I don't think so. B: I think it's just your, B: because I, I prefer to be waited on too. B: I just, B: if you're going to go out to eat, why not have the whole service, you know? A: Yeah, A: Yeah. B: Why not get the whole, B: I guess because we don't go out that much, A: Uh-huh. B: I feel like it's a treat. A: You should have a treat. B: Yeah. A: And I like the light meals. A: Not all restaurants have light meals on their menu, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: And I, B: Oh. B: Light menu, you mean like cooked light or, A: Uh, L I T E, like, uh, uh, things that aren't as heavy a meal. B: Oh, I see. A: It, B: Uh-huh. A: that, you get more, uh, fruit and maybe cottage cheese or a chicken breast or things that aren't as, uh, A: they're not breaded A: and they're not fried A: and they're not, B: Not a lot of gravy and things like that. A: Yeah. A: Uh, but it's not all rest, B: You know, I, I like those too. A: Uh-huh. B: I like those too, because, uh, some, seems like sometimes it's, you order a meal, you order their dinner meal, and it's like they're trying to find out how much you can eat. B: Or A: I know B: or A: it's too much, A: yes. B: Or, or like evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain B: and maybe they're afraid that people are going to, complain or something. A: Uh-huh. A: I don't know what it is. A: But, now for instance, we, we had a Scout dinner last night we went to. A: And it's, it's A: they, uh, well they'll serve you at your seat A: and usually the salad bar is included, A: so you have to get up for that. A: But they have so much food that you, not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself, you end up eating much more than you need. B: Uh-huh. B: And I think that's a shame. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, I must admit, sometimes I do like a buffet. B: But, uh, but I think that they just tend to make you, you say, Oh, well, I've have got all I can eat A: Uh-huh. B: or, or, you know, it's one of these situations where nobody's going to restrain what you eat, the amount that you eat. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And I think that that we just tend to eat, overeat. A: Yeah. A: You can eat as much as you want and you like the food, you know. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: Uh, a lot of times the foods, A: like, uh, Haas's carry a bread bar that is just out of this world A: And, you know, B: Yeah. A: you A: and soup A: and, uh, they just, A: and fruit and vegetables A: and they, they just, A: I don't know. A: I know I always overeat no matter. A: I go with good intentions, A: but I, A: somehow along the way, when I come back to my seat, I have too much. A: And I eat it because it's so good. B: Yeah. B: Well at least it's fruit and stuff there A: Yeah B: Maybe it's not too bad. A: And I like reasonable prices of course, too. A: I don't like to, you know, go to anything that's real expensive. B: Yeah. A: I think that's a waste of my money. B: Just for food, it does seem like it. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: But, uh, A: So, B: We like, uh, we do like international food, B: so we take, A: Do you? B: I like B: we like Indian food, A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, I love Italian food, A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, A: Chinese? B: Chinese B: but, A: We've got a good Chinese restaurant in town. B: Yeah. A: I, I really like eating there A: and, and you don't get stuffed on their food it seems. B: Yeah. A: You know, you can eat a whole big plate of their food, and you really don't feel like you've eaten too much. A: You're full, you know, A: you're satisfied, B: Yeah. A: but you don't feel stuffed and miserable. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: That's one thing that I wish we had more of, uh. B: Because where we're from, it's, it's pretty limited, B: and it's, B: most of the restaurants are, oh, they tend to be, you know, American style food. A: Uh-huh. B: And we don't have too many, B: you have to go all the way to Dallas. A: Um. B: And so it really is a treat, A: Uh, yeah. B: because, uh, A: Yeah. B: you know, we don't make a trip, sixty-five, eighty, you know, sixty-five to eighty miles. Depending how far in Dallas it is. A: Yeah. A: So what movies have you seen? B: Uh, well, I have, uh, seen DANCES WITH WOLVES, which is probably the, the best movie that I have seen lately. B: Uh, I do not go out to films very often. So, as far as out of the house. A: Uh-huh. B: So we do get a lot of videos that we bring in, B: uh, and I see some that way. B: But, uh, I am not real current on films. B: How about you? A: Yeah. A: I saw DANCES WITH WOLVES and, uh, HOME ALONE A: and, B: I hear that is really good, but I have not seen it yet. A: Yeah. A: It is. B: Yeah A: It is about a little kid that, that his parents go off to Paris. B: Uh-huh. A: And they, they forget all about him. A: The oldest daughter, they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of, B: Oh, cute. A: And he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble. B: Oh, dear. A: So she made him go sleep upstairs. B: Uh-huh. A: And there is, there is a couple of burglars, uh, breaking into the houses in the neighborhood. B: Oh, A: And, uh, B: Oh, and he hears them or something B: and, A: Yeah. A: And he sets up traps for them all over the house. B: Who wins? A: Uh, he does. B: Oh, great, B: great. B: Yeah, B: I had heard people talk about it, B: and they say it was really cute, but I had not seen it. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, we usually wait B: and eventually it comes out on video, B: and then we get it and see it that way. A: Right. B: And that is, it, B: movies are very expensive. B: Uh, movie theatres here, they are six dollars, uh, for evening performances. B: And that is kind of steep, A: Uh-huh. B: I think. B: I don't know. B: How much is it in Dallas? A: Well, it is six dollars, A: and then but you get, um, matinee prices. A: But, B: Yeah. B: You can do that, but it is difficult if you, if you work or, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: uh, that is taking the middle of the afternoon. B: And if I am looking for entertainment usually I, I, have more, uh, time in the evening than I do in the middle of the day to, uh, see things. B: What do you think of movies in general? B: As far as the, as the trends? A: Well, I think they are a lot better than they than they were, A: well, like, um, in the early eighties or the, during the, like the SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT era. B: Uh-huh. A: When it was, A: they, A: I do not think they were very good during that time. B: Yeah. A: At least there were not as many good ones. B: Did, B: Yeah. B: The quality I think maybe has improved in that respect. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a, a tougher rating. Which suggests that, that, you know, it will be more enticing to the, to the public. B: And a lot of times it is added for no real, uh, valid reason. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, which does not make, B: and I think SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT was a little bit like that. A: Yeah. B: Uh, but DANCES WITH WOLVES did not seem to have anything added. B: It was just all legitimate kind of, uh, film. B: And that is where reason why I suppose it won so many Oscars, uh, B: because it really was good even though it is such a long movie. B: You know, they said, "Oh, people won't, won't be interested in a three hour movie." But it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone. A: And it was shocking at the end too. A: So, B: Oh, oh, yeah. A: Yeah. B: Absolutely. B: Uh, but much more true to life B: and I think that is, that is the point. A: Yeah. A: That is right. B: Uh, they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good. A: Uh-huh. B: I hate sequels too. B: I hate these, uh, you know, number one, two, three, four. A: Uh-huh. B: Usually if a movie is good, once is enough A: Yeah. A: Especially JAWS. B: Right. B: That was on Prime Time Television here, uh, recently at seven thirty in the evening. B: And, uh, it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie. And children, young children could see, could have seen that movie, uh, at that hour. A: Uh-huh. B: And I thought, that, you know, that would not have been the sort of thing I would have wanted my children to see at that age, uh, I mean when they were young. B: And here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the T V. A: Right. B: Uh, which was a, B: it was a good movie. B: I mean it was well done but, uh, that is one reason why it was scary. A: Uh-huh. B: So, but I do not know that I have seen any of the, uh, sequels to that. B: I think one is enough. A: Yeah. B: Uh, A: Just more of the same. B: That is what people say. A: In one of them they have a mother shark, uh, destroy a whole, uh, marina and aquarium. Which is kind of far fetched. B: Oh. B: Yeah. B: It, B: just a touch. A: Yeah. B: Well, the whole movie is kind of far fetched. A: Uh-huh. B: But, I mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched. A: They hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody. B: Not, not too often A: Yeah. B: That has gotten to be a whole camp idea now though, you know. B: If you hear that music, you know, everybody knows what you are talking about. A: Yeah. B: It's funny. B: Well, it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs. A: Well, uh, every once in a while, I go, but it, it has to be like somebody that I like A: or, B: Yeah. A: you know. I did not, I did not go see FIELD OF DREAMS when it was in the theatre because I did not know it was any good. B: Uh-huh. A: And then when it was, I, I found out it was Kevin Costner when it was on, um, I guess A B C the other week, A: then I, B: Right. B: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: And then I really liked it. B: It was good. A: Uh-huh. B: It was very good. B: But, uh, um, uh, see I have, uh, teenagers in my house. B: And of course sometimes they rent movies and, you know, have friends over or something. B: And sometimes movies are here that I did not, I am not even aware that I could have seen, you know. B: Because my family tells me that, that, that it had been actually in the house before A: Huh. B: But I had missed it. B: But I did see it on T V, B: and I thought it was good. A: Yeah. A: It was really, A: and then, and then, uh, Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player. A: I thought they made him up, and then I found out, you know, after I saw the movie that, they, they started talking about that scandal A: and, B: Oh, really? A: Yeah, A: when the, when the anniversary came up B: Uh-huh. A: that was around the time of anniversary, you know. B: No kidding. A: And then it was on the news. B: Oh, I did not realize that. B: Yeah. B: Uh, you know, the character that, uh, James Earle Jones played? A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, uh, I teach in school, B: and we are doing a book called INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison. A: Uh-huh. B: And I wondered if maybe he was patterned after him. A: Yeah. B: Uh, I do not know, B: I had not heard anybody talk about it. B: But, uh, he certainly could have been. Uh, which was kind of interesting. You know, someone who, uh, who was a real activist but then took up the cause. Uh, kind of gave up, you know, because he did not think anything was happening, A: Yeah. B: and so, uh, it was kind of fun. A: Yeah. A: And I wondered who it was too. B: I do not know for sure, B: but there are certain, uh, qualities that suggest it could be he. B: Because they were, uh, they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse. B: That he had stopped writing and had stopped, you know, B: and that is true for Ellison. B: He, he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it. And, uh, has pretty much dropped out of public life. A: Huh. B: But he is still alive B: and that, you know, that is what makes it so interesting. A: Uh-huh. B: And that book, have you ever read that book? INVISIBLE MAN. A: Uh, I A: What is that? A: INVISIBLE MAN? B: INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison. A: Uh, no. A: Huh-uh. B: It is an incredible book. B: It, uh, really is very, very interesting. B: I highly recommend it. A: Uh, did they make the movies after that A: or, B: Uh, the, B: yeah, B: the movie, B: the B: in B: FIELD, FIELD OF DREAMS came out after, uh, that novel. A: Uh-huh. B: So it could easily have been patterned after him. B: But the, the movie did not have anything to do with, with the story that I am talking about. B: But A: Right. B: I just thought the the, uh, author could have been patterned after that, uh, B: I mean that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him, certainly. A: Uh-huh. B: Sort of interesting, B: so. Well, I guess we have talked probably our time limit, haven't we? A: Oh, yeah. B: Okay. A: Okay. A: It was Nice talking to you. B: Very good. B: It was nice talking to you. B: Okay. B: Bye-bye. A: Bye-bye. A: Are you in the market for a car recently? B: Yeah, B: I just bought a car. A: Oh, what did you get? B: I got a nineteen ninety-three Cavalier station wagon. A: Uh-huh, A: what, what convinced you to get that one? B: Well, a friend of my father's, and he'd driven it all over the country and it runs great. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, incredible, A: how many miles on it? B: It's like, it has a hundred and fifty-three thousand. A: And it's still running real well. B: Yeah. A: Oh, great, A: yeah. A: We have, uh, right now we have two cars, uh, A: I have, my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers and one of which is a, um, an eighty-eight Plymouth Voyager Van, B: Uh-huh. A: and then we have, um, A: about a year ago, we picked up a second hand, uh, uh, Audi B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, that was a you know, a sedan, A: and, uh, we got that. A: The major things, A: the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova, A: and a, A: well, A: my son was driving, A: and someone came into his lane and hit him, A: and fortunately he was able to, A: his, A: I mean he was checked out of the hospital, was out of the hospital by that night, but the car was completely totalled B: Uh-huh. A: and Mike, and, they had been, my two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that, which was hit by another car. B: Um. A: So I mean, I got, I was getting really nervous, A: so I finally said, we, I want a really solid car. A: So we found the Audi second hand. A: I guess right now my criteria for cars is, uh, of being solid, able to take an impact B: Right. A: and, uh, so, uh, I, we're not going to be in the market for, in the near future for any new car. B: Uh-huh A: But the things that I would want would be a solid car. A: Another thing I'd definitely want would be anti-lock brakes. B: Right. A: Uh, our, our van, which is a, a delight to drive, does not have, A: I think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just, are terrible. B: Um. A: If the road is at all wet, and I'm, A: and I don't go all that fast, but the, uh, it, it just doesn't hold. A: It doesn't hold well at all. A: So, I, I definitely want to get anti lock brakes. A: So, I don't know, A: do you have any particular things that, that are priorities on your list. B: Well, it's, B: I didn't really need power windows, but it has power, you know, windows and steering and air conditioning, A: Yeah. B: and, and uh. A: I guess down here air conditioning's a must, isn't it. B: Uh-huh, B: oh, yeah. B: It has a stereo and a cassette player A: Uh-huh. B: and, um, he's told me it gets forty-two miles to the gallon. A: That's incredible. B: Uh-huh. A: That is incredible. B: So. A: Uh, we, we get about, our, the van gets, on highways, can get about twenty-eight. A: The Audi does not have good mileage. A: That's the one drawback. A: It's a powerful car. Um, but it does not, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: I mean, I, if I'm on a highway and I can get twenty, twenty-one miles per gallon, I consider that I'm lucky. A: Maybe, maybe sometimes I've gotten twenty-two. A: It comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving B: Uh-huh. A: and that's a, to me is a real drawback. A: I wish I would, you know, I could settle for twenty-eight, A: but, uh, the, uh, the frills on that car are nice, but they're not necessary, for me except air conditioning. B: Uh-huh. A: In this area, uh, in Washington D C area, it gets hot and humid. B: Uh-huh, B: it's really humid. A: Yeah, A: uh, so air conditioning is uh, definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer. A: Um, but I, uh, I, I don't need, uh, you know, A: power windows are nice, but I don't need them Although I must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads, come into a toll road, you just push that button down, B: Right. A: it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up, instead of having to crank it. B: Crank, B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: but, or, you know, if you want to have open windows, to be able to A: if you're alone in the car just to press buttons, and. B: Right. B: You don't have to stretch. A: But you know, I've lived all these years without them, A: I probably could have lived a little longer B: That's true. A: Uh, one of the things that we have, uh, we've liked when we gotten a new car, and this, this used car has it, is a sun roof B: Uh-huh. A: and those are really nice in good weather. B: That's right. A: So, so I guess if we get a new car, it definitely would have to have anti lock brakes, A: I'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof, and, uh, just so it'd be a good solid car. B: Uh-huh. A: I guess that those are my major criteria. A: Everything else is, you know, a luxury, A: and they, make the car more expensive, but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong. B: Right. A: So, uh, if you were to buy a new car now, a brand new car, what would you look for? B: Um, like you said, anti-lock brakes and air bag, B: and, uh, I'd, I'd really like to have a car that's dependable that, that you drive, you know, like a American made car that's as dependable as Mercedes or somebody, you know that's, A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: Isn't that true. A: It's, it's funny, um, uh, that you use, A: the Audi's German, and I have to say, it has been pretty dependable. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: sometimes, one advantage of an American made car, is if you get stuck anywhere, most local garages can fix you up. B: Yeah, B: they have parts, B: uh-huh. A: But once you get, if you, once you get something fancy, you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really, B: Right, A: and the parts, I know the Audi parts are terribly expensive. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean, it A: I shudder. A: I would not get the Audi again, just for that reason. A: But I would love, I wish an American, an American, that, you know, engineering would make something as solid as a German car. A: You know, we certainly have the technology, B: Right. A: but, it's amazing, A: when we bought this Audi, A: I mean, everything is more solid in it. B: Right. A: Uh, if, A: you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic B: Uh-huh. A: and I know, A: and I, I, and I'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car. A: I don't think I have to give up as much as I'm giving up. B: Right. A: But, do you need air conditioning down there? B: Yes, B: we really do A: Yeah. B: because even today it's supposed to get up into the nineties. B: So A: Oh, we've had eleven days in a row over ninety. B: Uh-huh. A: They've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that. A: Well, listen, A: I enjoyed talking with you. A: Okay, A: and enjoy, enjoy your car. B: Yeah, B: have a nice summer. A: Thank you, A: you too, A: it's going to be a hot one. B: Yeah. A: Okay, A: bye-bye B: Bye-bye. A: Do you have any? B: I'm trying to think offhand B: I can't think of anything, you know. A: I have, I have one, B: Okay. A: and it's a real pet peeve of mine. A: It seems I, I do work during the day A: and when I'm home, uh, you know I'm either cooking or running doing, things or, uh, laundry or stuff. B: Uh-huh. A: And I hate when the phone rings and it turns out to be a telephone salesman. B: Oh A: And it's real, A: the two pet peeves that, A: number one, I really feel that that's my private, you know, my own home. B: Uh-huh. A: And I A: and if I want something, I will get it. B: Uh-huh. A: I will go out and get it myself. A: And I will never, I never buy anything from a telephone, salesperson. B: Oh, I wouldn't, either, B: no. A: So, I really feel that it is a real invasion, they're invading my time and my space by, you know, interfering in whatever I'm doing B: Uh-huh. A: and I, A: it really bothers me. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, it's a little bit like junk mail but except you can't, you know, ignore it, uh, quite as easily. B: Yeah. A: And I, I try to be polite, A: but at the same point, B: That doesn't always work. A: Well, I just say thank you very much for calling but I'm not interested, A: and then I hang up before they can say anything. B: Oh, really? A: Yes, A: and it works very well B: Oh A: Because you don't hear, you know how, A: they can say anything they want A: it's just, A: but I just feel that's my big thing on the invasion of, my thing on invasion of privacy. B: Uh-huh. A: And, um, I have, uh, I sort of have a sort like A: you can prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists. A: I wish that there were a way that you could, um, get your you know, submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things, from a B: Uh-huh, B: well, how do you get your name off the junk mailing list? A: Uh, you, you, you, you do that by, uh, um, A: the postal service has some information which you fill out and they send, A: it's for every company, A: I mean you can't do it for any B: Uh-huh. A: you know, but you can then send it A: and they can A: they tell, A: that company is not allowed to sent it, you any junk mail. B: Oh, really? A: If you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can, B: Oh, I didn't even know that. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out to, not to get, you know, junk mail from specific companies. B: Oh, wow. A: And I wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company B: Yeah. A: and you could say that, uh, have your your number put in a registry. A: And then anyone making these calls have to check that registry for that area and could not, should, and is not allowed under penalty of, you know, being reported or something to call you. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: So that would be one way of doing it. B: I can't really think of anything that invades my privacy, B: but one of my pet peeves, you came up with the telephone is, when you have an answering machine and they hang up before they leave a message. A: Uh-huh. B: I can't stand that. B: I think that is so stupid, you know, B: because, A: Oh, I'm guilty of that sometimes A: because I've called and there really wasn't any significant message A: and I, and I wasn't going to be available to be called back. B: Uh-huh. A: And it was sort of like, oh, the hell, A: I'm not going to spend the time giving, leaving a message, A: and, uh, I'll call later, if I'm available. B: Yeah. A: The other thing that, um, that there is recourse to and that's another thing, is when you, you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number. B: Uh-huh. A: Well, legally now they're not allowed, A: they're A: you do not have to give a telephone number. B: Oh, really? A: Yes. A: And I don't really like announcing in public B: Uh-huh. A: you know, when you're sitting there, A: my telephone and I don't like the way telephone numbers can be used. B: Uh-huh. A: We once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number, A: but it turned out it had to have been my husband's office phone number. A: And, uh, we were able, we weren't actually able to trace it, but we were able to, to discard the charges. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, but it was, B: I don't like how they B: the, B: I, I realize that this is your identification B: but I worked with someone that got hold of his, charge cards, and his social security number. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: same with my husband. A: It was the charge card and social security number. B: And, you know, I don't, I don't like, I don't ever get anything over the phone because I don't want to give my social security number out. A: Well, you should never give the social security number. A: Uh, if sometimes, if you charge, A: sometimes I charge theater tickets over the phone. B: Uh-huh. A: And then, you know, because they pick them up at the box office we'll call. A: But, um, that's the only thing I would ever have ever used it for the phone A: and that was because I initiated it. B: Yes. A: Uh, and occasionally I do order things from catalogs over the phone. B: Uh-huh. A: But again it's, I initiate it not the company. A: The other thing is though you do not have to, A: if you're buying something in a store and they and you pay for it by charge and they ask you for your telephone number, you do not have to give it. A: That is one, that's a law that went into effect, I don't know a year or two ago. B: Oh, I never even knew that. A: And, uh, you can just say I'm sorry that uh, I'm not required to give that by law A: and then they won't, A: a lot of stores will still ask. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, the credit card company, you know, accepts the charges. A: I mean A: a A: the credit cards company's responsibility. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, is there any, like pet peeves that you have that don't necessarily invade your privacy? A: So in this , A: Um, well, this would, this is limited to the privacy issue, the invasion of privacy. B: Oh, okay. A: Yeah, A: and I guess, uh, that was my, that's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy. For people outside the family, of course, A: I've got little pet peeves, you know, with my family. A: You know. But of course, A: I guess that just comes with the, uh, with the territory with a family that A: does a mother can do some privacy. B: I really, can't think of any that would invade my privacy you know. A: But, uh, A: Uh-huh. A: Nothing that you felt that, you know, A: any experiences you've had at work? B: No. B: I, you know, B: I, I really can't say anything that would really bother me. A: So many things I think over the years have been, um, accepted, I mean when you, uh, that are no longer done. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean I can remember when I was very young, much younger and I applied for a job A: they said, well, aren't you planning to have children. A: Well, I mean, that's none of their business. B: Yeah. A: And but of course, now by law they can't ask that. B: Yeah. A: So I mean there has been I think a lot to, done to protect privacy. B: Yeah, B: especially between women and, A: How do you feel, A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: they've gotten a lot with, uh, B: applications and stuff and aren't allowed to ask. A: That's right. B: No, B: because, B: I think it's for the better of like B: you mean like for working and stuff? A: Yeah, A: uh-huh. B: No, B: I don't because I think whenever, and something like that B: they're looking out for everyone. B: They're not, A: Yeah. B: you know, I think it's more safety than anything else. A: I feel that way too. A: I sometimes feel you know, sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit. B: Yeah. B: Because I know, A: You know, for example airline pilots. A: I mean I do want my pilot to be sober B: Yeah. B: Because I know, B: I worked at a still mill in this summer. B: And I know, that, um, I've covered for people that came in drunk, you know, on the late shift or something, A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: and it, and it's dangerous. B: I don't even like having them around. B: I kind of do their work for them because they make it more hazardous than what it is without them, you know. A: That's right. A: Yeah, A: I know A: yeah, A: I feel, you know, I think some of the people that oppose, you know, mandatory drug testing for certain areas say, well, it's not, B: So, uh, let's see what was the topic, B: I forgot B: we are supposed to talk, A: Advice for people taking for parents, uh, help their kids through college. B: Yeah, B: do you have any children? A: No, A: I just graduated from college. B: Oh, did you? A: Yes. B: Where did you go? A: I went to Clarion. B: Clarion. A: Uh-huh. B: Really. A: It just seems so sad to have to only rely on, you know, college football. A: Is that all they're going to have to make money, you know. B: Yeah. A: But I didn't think that was the objective, to make money. A: But it seems like it is. B: Huh. It really is. B: I know there's a lot of pressure on schools to have a winning program. To get the best athletes so they can keep their seats full. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: You went to Indiana University? B: Uh, Purdue. A: Oh Purdue, A: okay. B: Yeah. A: Well, good. B: So. A: You're, you're a T I up in Sherman? B: Uh-huh. A: Oh, very good. B: Are you from Dallas area? A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: I'm in the facilities there, down here in Dallas. B: Yeah, B: I guess football is the big sport down here, isn't it. A: Uh, certainly high school football, and college football, A: but again high school football is just so much fun to watch, A: because, uh, you know, not everybody plays of course, but they're still, A: it's good A: and it's still, A: you know the kids, A: and there's absolutely no money involved whatsoever, B: Yeah. A: and you know they're going to class, you know. B: You heard of, Have you heard of Damon Bailey. The I U white guard that plays. A: It, it's, it's real amateur sports. A: Huh-uh. A: Huh-uh. B: Well, last year, when he was in high school, they drew a crowd of like forty-one thousand for the state finals, when he played. A: Is that right? A: I never heard , A: that's, uh, A: I never been in a football game in high school that had that many. B: Yeah, B: so that's, I mean, that's pretty big. B: Like he's from Indiana, B: and he plays for Indiana now. B: And, Indiana him to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there. B: The Pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd B: You know, the high school games, I mean, that seems to be the big attraction, and college. A: Well, my office mate here, Earl, he, he goes to all the Maverick games A: and he loves that. A: He, he would be, A: this is a great question for him, uh, to talk about A: Like he's got, A: I'm looking at his calendar, A: he's got all over the place, A: and he goes to a lot of the Maverick games and everything. A: But, I, I, I can't get interested at all, A: zero. A: I, I listen to him, A: and occasionally I'll watch them on channel eleven, A: but gee, A: I can't, uh, A: more than five minutes of a basketball game, just seems about, A: that's it, A: of, uh, pro anyway. B: Yeah, B: seems like you could set the score at a hundred and then give them five minutes to play, A: Yeah. B: then it'd be the same result. A: Yeah. B: Because they, they start, B: they shoot so much, B: and then the last, what, five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner, I guess. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I'm surprised a little bit when you're talking about basketball how some players work. A: Mavericks had, oh two players this year that they got rid of last year. A: I'll think of them in a minute. A: Perkins, Sam Perkins, A: can't think of the other one. A: They're both. B: Tarpley, B: is he one? A: Pardon me? B: Tarpley? A: Yeah, A: Tarpley, A: and they both a little more a casual thing. A: But in mine the wintertime it's not bad too because then I've got a, a fireplace and a nice, nice house and all that A: so we, really good place to do entertaining like that. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, that sounds wonderful. A: I just haven't, uh, really tried a whole lot A: but, uh I don't know, B: Uh-huh. A: let's see. A: I have had, well, one time I did have a dinner party. A: I served a, uh, uh, A: I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits, and kind of southern, uh, southern food even though I'm up here in New York, B: Uh-huh. A: so B: Oh, you are in New York right now? A: Yeah. B: Oh. B: I'm, I'm in Texas. B: I didn't know this was all, from all over the whole country. A: Oh, yeah. A: Yeah, B: Oh, I see. A: it is. A: It's, B: And I'm originally from Long Island. A: Oh, no kidding? B: Yes, B: and now where are you in New York? A: Upstate. B: Oh, upstate. A: Rome. A: In, uh, Griffins Air Force Base. B: Oh, okay. B: Oh, okay. B: Is that where you, you are originally from around there? B: Oh, okay. A: and, uh, been all over the place. B: Oh, wow. B: That's interesting. B: Okay, B: let's see. B: Um, well, I like to have, um, sometimes when I have a dinner party I'll have, um, everybody bring something, A: Yeah. B: and that's real interesting because then you get different, um, different kinds of foods and new recipes B: and, um, uh, sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like, A: Right. B: and get the recipe from them or whatever. B: And we are just getting interested in, in Mexican food B: because here in Texas they have lots of, really good Mexican restaurants A: Uh-huh. B: and, um, we're, we're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could, A: Sure. B: do you know what a fajita is? A: Yeah. A: Yeah, B: Yeah. A: I've been down to Texas a few times, and, uh, had, uh, the pleasure of their good Mexican, cuisine down there. B: Okay. B: Yes. B: They have some delicious, delicious things, B: and I, um, B: since I always make chicken burritos and just take chicken breasts A: Uh-huh. B: and you boil them, maybe like four chicken breasts, B: and you boil them until they are cooked. Maybe like thirty minutes A: Uh-huh. B: and then you debone them and, and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled B: and you take, um, little bit, maybe two tablespoons of butter and a in a big frying pan. And chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt, A: Uh, I guess I've always kind of liked golf. A: I, I worked on a golf course at, at one time A: and that's how I picked up golf. A: And, uh, I don't know A: it's just a, kind of a challenging game. B: It sure is. B: I play at least three times a week. A: Uh-huh. B: I'm on it, A: I haven't gotten the chance lately though to play. A: I'm trying to get back into it. A: Uh, so, uh, I got to start all over again. A: It's not like riding a bicycle. A: You do tend to, forget. B: No. B: Well, I'm one of those rare left-handed golfers. A: Oh. A: Yeah. B: And I do enjoy playing. A: What is your handicap? B: Right now it's three. A: Okay. A: Uh, I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago. A: It's probably up there to twenty now if I to start again. B: Well, if you play with some consistency though, you can get it right back down. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: I have got to try and get out there. A: I, I know with our, our long winters I, I enjoy watching it. A: I don't know if it's just because I like the game or I just like to, to see the warm weather. B: Uh, well, we can usually play here year around. B: Sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play. A: Uh-huh. B: But there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play, B: and I'm pretty much addicted to golf, B: so. I get out there one way or the other. A: Yeah, A: that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter A: you almost have to relearn every spring to, to get back out. B: It's a good game though. B: It's very challenging B: and the reason I like it so much is because I'm essentially playing against myself. A: Yeah. B: That's the way I look at it. B: I, I play in, in a lot of groups B: and but I, they keep score and, between themselves B: but I really don't care. B: Um, I go out B: and each shot I say, well, this is what I'm going to try to do A: Uh-huh. B: and then I see how close I can come to that. A: Right. A: Yeah, A: you always work on trying to improve each day A: and, B: Yeah, B: and inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another. B: Either I'm not driving very well B: or I'm not hitting long irons very well B: or I'm not putting well B: or, but sometimes it all comes together. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I know what you mean. A: I, when I used to golf out there I'd putt well but I, I wouldn't, uh, chip well. A: One of the two, uh, A: or something would go wrong A: but I always managed to, to get near par anyway. B: Well, we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst. A: Oh. B: And I went to that. B: Craig Statler won in a playoff. A: Uh-huh. B: But we, uh, B: this is a big golf area. A: Yeah. B: We have a lot of, uh, B: I'd say we probably have within fifteen miles, twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course, Pine Hurst B: and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year. A: Uh-huh. A: Do you have, uh, long waits, uh, to get on the course? B: Yes, B: we do as a matter of fact. B: It, it, uh, it's only been that way in the last five years. A: Yeah. B: But now you, uh, B: most of the courses have a, uh, two day advance tee time you have to call, A: Yeah. A: Okay. A: I just moved into this small community A: so I'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here. A: I'm hoping that won't be, A: I, was from the, uh, twin cities area. B: That's some cold golf too, isn't it? A: Yeah A: Are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather? B: We have cold. A: Yeah. B: Usually January and the first two weeks of February. A: Well, I wish that's all we had. B: But, uh, last week we were in the seventies. B: Something is coming through now B: so it's like in the low forties right now. A: Oh. B: But, uh, it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties. B: We have very windy winters and very cold. A: Yeah B: But we don't get any snow anymore. B: I don't, I don't know what changed that pattern. B: We used to get four or five inches a year. B: Now we get nothing. B: It's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall. A: I see. A: Well, at least it, that doesn't, uh, get in the way of golfing A: so that B: No, Get out my orange golf ball and go out. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: that's what they do here sometimes. A: You hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there A: but, if you got, B: Okay. A: So what do you, uh, think is the, uh, the worst culprit for air pollution? B: Well, I think it's, it's probably a combination of things. B: Um, factories that, that burn coal as a, an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants, you know, B: and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain, B: and I think that's, that's probably hurting us a little bit. B: It's hurting, you know, it's hurting Germany, for example, too, and some other parts of Europe where they, where they have high industry. B: So we're not the lone ranger here. A: Yeah. A: I, uh, I, A: it's hard to put the finger on, uh, what's worse, you know, the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion, um, with, uh, your hydrocarbons, uh causing the damage in which, B: Yeah. B: Hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit, B: but I know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot. A: Well, I notice on one of these, uh, home shopping networks they were selling these, uh, halogen, uh, fire extinguishers B: Yeah. A: and the halogen is, uh, an ozone depleter, A: and it got hydrocarbons in there. A: It's a very clean, uh, fire extinguisher, A: but it's, you know, really bad on the environment. B: Yeah. B: Huh. B: Yeah, B: I guess I missed that one. B: Uh. A: Yeah. B: Automobiles of course are contributing, too, B: and, you know, how, how we are with our love affair with the auto A: Yeah. B: kind of hard to do anything about that, I guess. A: I know, A: uh, in the Twin Cities area, A: I just moved out of there and was kind of happy I timed it just right, A: but they had a new policy where in order to get your, uh, your license, uh, your car license, uh, renewed, you had to meet the pollution standards B: Yeah. A: and, uh. B: We have that here, too, B: but it's part of the inspection sticker, you know, B: they put a probe in your exhaust pipe B: and, and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out, B: and so that's, you know, that's the way they're dealing with it here. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, uh, A: yeah A: I guess that was just mainly in the cities there, A: and as far as where I live, I don't have to do that, A: but I have an old car which I doubt would, uh, would, uh, pass the inspection, a seventy-six, B: Yeah. A: and, uh, you know, there's no way I would put in a lot of money to, to repair it to meet standards. B: Yeah. B: It'd probably be difficult anyway. A: Yeah. A: So, although I do what I can to, to cut down pollution, A: but, uh. B: I was just reading an article in, uh, MOTHER EARTH NEWS, MOTHER EARTH NEWS magazine A: Yeah. B: and, uh, they've got a new, uh, B: you know a lot of places are burning wood A: Yeah. B: a lot, a lot of people are burning wood, B: those of us who have, B: I've got a place in the country, you know A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, they've had catalytic you know, catalytic converters on those, on, B: uh, I think they're required in California and Oregon and, and Washington, B: but they've had up those for quite a while, B: and somebody's come up with a new one that, uh, sort of, B: it's a, it's a catalytic converter, B: it's, it's a plate that fits in, you know, into the smoke pipe A: Yeah. B: and, uh, apparently it sort of feeds itself. B: The more smoke is produced, you know, B: after you get to like five hundred degrees, the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is. B: And it sounds real neat. B: I haven't seen them priced anywhere yet, B: but that, that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on you know, old, old, uh, older stoves that don't have any kind of E P A requirements on them. A: Yeah. B: That might help a little bit, especially in some places. B: We're really lucky here. B: We have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out. A: Yeah. B: Now sometimes we get a kind of a, B: especially in, in, uh, autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us, B: but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well. A: Yeah. B: Probably blowing up there to you guys A: Yeah, A: well, well around here I, we get, uh, A: well it depends, you know, A: either in the, in the winter time it, it blows it your way, A: and in the summer time we probably get yours. B: Yeah. B: It comes back. B: Yeah. B: I really think, uh, you know, we're doing some, some important things. B: Education, raising consciousness awareness, B: uh, I know school kids, B: I work for the school district here, B: and, uh, you know, this is one of the big things with kids. B: Kids are writing letters to the newspapers about, you know, telling adults to clean up their act A: Yeah. B: and, it's uh, you know, B: I hope we're not too late with it. B: We're, we're, uh, we're having all kinds of recycling. A: Yeah, A: well, it, uh, that's a big thing, too. A: I know it has nothing to do with air pollution, A: but I kind of look at the way people treat our, A: Surprised they get anybody this time of day A: but, I've been trying all different times, B: Uh-huh. A: but I don't get anybody at five thirty, don't get anybody at nine at night A: so thought, I'll try , B: Oh, well, I'm at, work B: and I just happened to walk back into my office. A: Oh B: I've been gone for a little while A: Oh. A: Well, I go to school A: so I'm home certain days, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, I really haven't been making any phone calls, have you? A: Got, B: I don't, I haven't ever made any. B: I just receive them A: Oh A: Have you, have you received many? B: I haven't here lately. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: It's, it's, uh, A: well, the first time we were on this it came just about every day. B: Yeah. A: I never had to make one. A: They just always came B: Yeah. B: Exactly. A: People must be tired of it or something. A: well anyway I guess we're supposed to discuss this, uh, subject, A: what do you think? B: Well, I never gave it any thought myself B: I was hoping you could tell me what you thought. A: Oh. A: Well, I don't have any objection to people doing that. A: I think it might be good for them. B: Uh-huh. A: But as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent. B: Exactly. A: I'm just concerned about their safety B: Uh-huh. A: because if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: And if they were sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait worried, you know. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: That, that would be my main objection. I don't think, B: Uh-huh. B: I don't know B: I think maybe it's, it should stay on a voluntary basis A: it will probably never happen A: but, B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I, I think it would be good for, uh, everyone to do something like that B: but I, I guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon you. A: Yeah, A: well it, it probably won't. B: Uh-huh. A: I don't, I don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway. A: We can't, uh seem to pay for all the little things we have going now B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: That's another consideration B: Exactly A: But, uh, I don't know A: some kids are so spoiled nowadays A: it might be a real eye opener, you know B: Really A: I mean, sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here A: and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes A: and then they think, A: they're just kind of shocked at that side of town, you know B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl B: I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while A: Oh A: Well that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it? B: Wouldn't it though? A: I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country. B: Uh-huh, B: it is. A: I know. A: Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world, and helping some countries I never even heard of. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: I know it. A: It seems to me we are, A: it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country. Right on our borders. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: But, what do I know, right? A: I'm just sitting at home and, and, uh, doing laundry today and certainly not up, A: nobody has called me from Washington A: Oh, but, uh, anyway, how did you get on this program? B: I work at T I. A: Oh, you do work at T I? A: Oh, you're in Lewisville. B: Uh-huh. A: Oh, yeah. A: I just went by that place. A: We were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost A: and, uh we went by. A: That's the first time I'd seen it. A: It looked really nice. B: Yeah. A: A lot of trees there. A: It looked like a pretty little, a sight. B: Hang on a minute. A: Sure. B: to someone in the No, B: I don't think so, B: Yeah, B: Patty might. B: I'm back. A: Oh, sure. B: But how did you get on it? A: Well, my husband works at T I over on Central. B: Oh. A: Uh, why we're living in Arlington I'm not so sure A: but, he works over there A: and A: we did it last time. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, so I'm, just my daughter and I are registered this time. A: I don't know, A: they didn't even ask him back B: Really? A: That was weird, wasn't it? B: Huh. A: But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time. B: Uh-huh. B: I don't get too many. A: And I can never find anybody. B: Huh. A: So, um, B: The first time I used to get calls from far away too. A: Right. B: Like Maryland, and New Jersey, A: Uh-huh. B: and but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from. A: Yeah, A: I've had the same experiences, B: Uh-huh. A: all right around here. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I don't know, uh, A: I wonder if they really, A: I don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents. A: There's just, there's so many with this one town you know. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: even in some families some people talk a little bit different. B: Oh, yeah. B: Yeah. A: My husband is from New Jersey A: and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me A: and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way, A: and that's one family, right? A: Of course, I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny A: but B: Oh, I agree. A: You know, how that goes B: Oh, shoot. A: Oh, God. A: Well, I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet. A: Sometimes she says at night. Or, or or overloads B: Yeah. A: so please end your conversation. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: Right. A: Well, do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject? B: No, B: I sure don't A: You don't have any kids you want to send over here? B: No, B: no kids A: Well, is B: Oh, shoot. A: Well, uh, I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto. A: Well, one of them is real idealistic, A: she might B: My sister is, B: I'd be more suited to that than her B: she's just bugs, B: Okay, B: you ready? A: Yeah, A: is that it? B: That's it. A: Okay, A: Uh, well, we, I guess we have to talk about magazines A: and, uh, what, what, B: What, what kind do you subscribe to or do you? A: Well, I subscribe to well, I did subscribe to PEOPLE for a long time. A: I do, you know, A: I enjoy PEOPLE. A: And now I'm, uh, I, uh, subscribe to, uh, LADIES HOME JOURNAL. B: I, uh, take a computer magazine. And, uh, also, uh, BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS. A: Uh-huh. A: Okay, A: are you interested in, in computers? B: And my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside. And the cardboard pages A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah, A: well, that, that would be one of my peeves. A: My pet peeves with magazines, the woman's magazines especially, A: I mean, it's, it's really geared to, A: all they have, A: you have too many recipes first of all. A: I just don't, you know, A: that's what I don't like about LADIES HOME JOURNAL magazines. A: Too many recipes, too many, uh, can this marriage with saved nonsense. A: I, you know, I like to read articles about things that matter. A: Well, of course, PEOPLE magazine is not, you know, one of your, uh, your more intellectual magazines, A: but it's nice, light reading A: You know, if I want something intellectual, I usually read a book. B: Well, that's true. B: I, uh, I like it when they have short stories. B: Like REDBOOK used to always have a good short story in it. A: Well, that's true, A: yeah, A: they did. B: And I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while B: so I guess A: Yeah. B: I, I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore A: Well, is REDBOOK still in existence? A: I don't know if they're, if they're around anymore. B: Yeah B: I think it is. B: it's an institution, B: surely it would have to be. A: Yeah. B: But, A: Well, I'll tell you, the only reason I bought the, uh, I subscribe to the JOURNAL is because of, A: which I think it was either, A: yeah, A: it was Publisher's Clearinghouse B: Right A: They told me, you know, if I didn't subscribe they were going to take me off their, their winning, you know, their list A: So, B: Mine, too B: This was it, my last chance A: Yeah, A: my last, right, my last chance to win ten million dollars, A: so I figured, hey, look For twelve dollars, you know, B: Well, I, I, I went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that uh, to, uh, ENTERTAINMENT. A: That's it. A: Oh, yeah, A: oh, uh-huh. B: And I was real disappointed with it. A: Yeah. B: I, I don't know, B: it just, B: not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into. A: Right. B: It's little short articles more than anything else. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's one thing I don't like about PEOPLE. B: Uh, it 's just, you know, doesn't seem to have enough story to it. A: Well, I don't know, A: I just think, uh, you know, it's, It's light reading. B: If you've only got a short time to read A: You know, you don't have, well, you don't have to concentrate, you know you know. B: No, B: that's true A: It's entertaining, you know, A: and, uh, that's, A: I just, I enjoy it, A: I, you know, I, uh A: Well, that ENTERTAINMENT is, is very, A: wasn't that similar, or isn't it similar to, to the TV GUIDE? B: Uh, no, B: not really. B: I mean, not the one I take now. B: It's a, it's a magazine B: and it goes into all the movies, previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes. A: Oh, uh-huh. A: Oh, I see. B: And, uh, I'm a real movie buff, B: so that's why I thought I might be interested in it, B: but it just hasn't been what I thought it would be. A: Oh, uh-huh. B: And, uh, my mother has subscribed to, is the reason I get, uh, the HOME JOURNAL and the, uh, computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me. A: Oh. B: Otherwise, if, if I really want to take the time to read a magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf, I'll pick it up then. Rather than having them delivered and think, oh, I really need to read this A: Right, A: right. A: Well, I'll tell you, since I've been getting the JOURNAL, like maybe, maybe I'll read two, maybe three, A: if I read three articles in, in, you know, one of the JOURNALs, I figure, you know, I did really well. B: Yeah, A: Because there's just nothing in there that interests me. A: I don't, you know, I don't, I'm not into, you know, recipes A: and B: Well, I, I do like recipes and crafts. A: See, now, and I'm not into crafts, A: so, you know, that, that eliminates, like three quarters of the magazine You know. B: That's true. A: Well, I just got the new issue, A: they have Bette Midler on the cover, A: so that should be one article that I'll read anyway B: Do you, uh, A: So, how is the weather out there? B: Uh, it's really cold B: and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold B: and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had. A: Oh, really? B: You have, breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff. B: How about you guys? A: Um. Uh, it's just, it's a, it's about same. A: The usual, I think. B: Oh. A: So, nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff A: It's good. B: Yeah, B: well the weather, let's see, well, the snow here is different from Utah's, B: because I have lived in Utah for like ten years. A: Oh, really? A: What part? B: And, uh, B: Provo. B: I was going to B Y U. A: Oh, really? A: Okay. B: Yeah. B: And, uh, the snow is like, really cold. B: I mean, it's, like, really humid B: so it seems wetter or something like that. B: It's, A: It's more humid in Utah than there? B: Uh-huh. A: Or there? B: It's more humid in Iowa than Utah. A: Okay. A: Right. B: Yeah. A: Okay. B: And it seems like when the winds blow, it's really, it goes right through you. B: It's really different from Utah's weather. B: I thought Utah was cold, B: but I think Iowa is a lot colder A: Yeah, A: see, that's how it is in Texas, too A: because when it's cold, it's really cold. A: So, B: Yeah, B: I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind A: What's that? B: I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind. A: Right. A: Yeah. A: So the humidity is I think what does it B: Yeah, B: I think that's true. A: Because I, I noticed when I got here, too, A: because like I'd, A: when it would snow in Texas uh, I would just, I mean we'd be really cold B: Uh-huh. A: and we'd have to get really warm, A: and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing A: and you don't you don't feel super cold. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: that's true. A: It was weird. B: Yeah. A: But, so how long ago did you graduate? A: Or did you, A: or, B: Uh, I graduated in nineteen eighty-seven. A: Oh, really? B: Yeah, B: my husband got his doctorate at B Y U, B: so that's, B: and so he just graduated this past year. A: Oh. A: So you just barely moved away? B: Uh-huh B: Yeah, Well, we really miss Utah A: Do you like it out there? B: We miss the mountains. A: You do? A: Yeah. B: Because it's, like, really flat here B: Well, not flat, but hilly. B: But no big mountains or anything. A: Uh-huh. A: So you just moved away a year ago? B: Uh, in August. A: Wow, really recent. B: Yeah. B: But, uh, see, see what else can I say about the weather. B: Uh, well, today was warmer B: It was like forty-five A: Oh, warm B: So, what's the temperature up today over there? A: Oh, man, A: it's got to be like, it's probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe. B: Oh, really? A: Maybe not that warm. A: Probably about, uh, A: yeah. A: It's not, it's not that cold, really. B: And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah, I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill. A: Yeah. B: But they talk about wind chill here all the time. A: Yeah, A: that's a big deal in Texas, too. B: They said it could be, like, six degrees out and, like, negative forty-one wind chill. A: Um. B: So, that's what we're not used to A: Yeah, A: that's true. A: That makes a big difference. Huh. B: So, oh, I, A: So, did you used to ski when you were out here? B: What's that? A: Did you used to ski when you were in Utah? B: Oh, I've only, I've only skied in Utah once. A: Oh, really? B: I only skied once my whole life B: But, do you do a lot of skiing there? A: Uh, not tons, A: but I like to when I get a chance. B: Uh-huh. A: I've only been once so far, but had the opportunity a couple times since then. A: Just saving my money for Christmas things and that. B: Yeah. B: So is this your first year in Utah? A: Uh, no, A: this is actually my third year. B: And you're going to school there? A: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: Yep. B: At U of U, B: or, A: No, A: at B Y U. B: Oh, really? A: Yeah. B: Oh. A: So, but, I'll be here a long time at this rate. B: What's your major? A: Uh, it was nursing, A: but I'm in the process of changing it right now. B: Uh-huh, B: oh. A: Because it's really, really competitive at B Y U. B: Yeah. A: You have to have like a three seven to get in A: so, It's really, B: That's true. A: I'm going to look into some other fields. A: I'd like, A: all the science classes and that, I'm just not really enjoying too much A: so I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school B: Uh-huh. A: so, B: Yeah, B: that's, that's a good idea. A: Did you graduate in a certain field A: or, B: Uh, education. B: I got a double major. A: In, B: Uh, elementary and special ed. A: Really? B: Uh-huh. A: That what my sister did. B: Oh, really? A: Yeah, A: you might know her. A: Here name is Lori, Bird. A: Maybe not A: I think she graduated around then, too, though, eighty-seven probably, A: but, she got her B: Yeah, B: well, I can't, B: there are so many girls in all my classes, B: I can't remember how many people. A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: Because they, since, uh, stopped that program. I mean, where you can where you can get it double pretty easily. B: Oh, have they? B: Oh. A: I mean, it's, it's really, A: We're set. B: Okay. A: What changes do you feel have happened? B: Oh, I guess the first thing has been the, uh, for the right, for women to vote. B: I think that has been a major change and also the fact that, uh, there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were B: and that's probably going to increase. You know. A: Right. A: Increases each year, doesn't it? B: I'm sorry? A: It increases each year I think. B: It sure does. B: Yeah, B: there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays. A: Well, and I think women have kind of had, uh, in the past the real subservient role. B: Role? B: Right. A: And, uh, B: That's changing A: Well, we do to some degree B: Right. A: but, uh, uh, I think it's not as much as it was. B: Right, B: yeah, B: I, I agree. B: It definitely has changed. A: I, And especially, I think with women increasingly working, they're going to have to demand more from men. B: Uh-huh. A: Because there is just, impossible to keep up on everything else. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active role in taking care of the home. B: Well, you know, they've been talking about B: and I don't know, uh, what the status is on it, B: but, you know, women get maternity leave and stuff like that B: and I know that they've, there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out, A: Right. B: but you know, I haven't really heard much about that recently. A: Well, you know, there is a lot of companies that won't give women maternity leave for that very reason. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, in fact, I know the school districts down here, you, they don't have maternity leave. A: Uh you simply have to take, accumulate your sick leave. And take your sick leave. B: Oh, is that right? B: Oh. B: Uh-huh. A: And I don't know, uh, if bigger company companies do, A: but when I was employed with the school district, I didn't have maternity leave either A: and that was the reason A: because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men A: but, So, uh, B: Huh, that's interesting. B: That's a bummer, though A: Yeah A: it is. B: I mean, You got to take the time off A: You have to save all of your, uh, vacation time. A: You do. A: You have to save all your vacation time A: and that's usually how it's, uh, happened, B: Yeah. A: but, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: What do you see, uh, changing in the future? B: I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies, uh, run by females. A: Right, A: and, and top level. B: And we'll B: I'm sorry? A: Maybe top level. B: Right, B: right, B: upper management, B: more women in upper management B: and probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles. B: More governors and, I think, you know, roles like that. A: That would be kind of nice B: Well, we've got, in Texas, we have a female governor. A: That's right, A: that's right. B: And we had a female mayor here in Dallas, B: and she just, her term just ended B: and, uh, so I think we're probably going to see more of that in the future A: Yeah A: I think that's probably good. A: A little more integration. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners A: and, B: Right, you know, B: I mean, and that's fine with me A: I think, B: but sometimes, B: I mean I'm not a women's libber by any means, B: but I do, A: Right. B: there are issues that, you know, as far as, like, equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff, I totally am for. A: Right. B: But, I don't get into the, uh, the real women libber movement, you know. A: No, A: I don't either. A: I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal B: Yeah. A: We just function differently B: Right, B: right. A: And, uh, I'm not capable of lifting what, uh, a man can lift and you know, that type of, that type of thing, B: Yeah. A: but, uh one of the big changes, uh, they're doing in Salt Lake is, uh, B: Right. A: and they're probably, A: I'm sure, in Dallas since you're big places, a lot more women are, uh, working right out of their home with their P C's or with their lap computers or whatever. B: Yeah, B: I, I've heard of that. B: Uh, I haven't really talked to anybody that's, you know, too involved with that. B: But, I mean, I think that is a, A: I think that, B: Like the cottage industry. B: Is, is that what you're talking about, women working out of their homes? A: Right. B: Yeah, B: uh, I think it's wonderful A: Right. A: You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week A: and, B: Yeah. A: Course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that, B: Oh, I B: By the phone and all that. A: so, uh, it would be kind of exciting in some ways to, to see a little bit more of that A: and some ways, it might be kind of scary. B: Right. A: Think anybody could do it, A: but, Anyway, B: Right. B: Yeah, B: I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up A: Right. A: Right, A: but then you know, there is the process of selection. A: Would you have to give them the brand You know, when you shop, you usually compare the prices B: Right. B: Right. A: and, would be nice, though. A: How big is Provo? B: Um. A: That a little town or, or a bigger city? B: Um, it's not one of the bigger ones. It's probably, um, I compare it to the size of Plano, maybe a little smaller. B: Plano, Texas. No *nn A: Oh. A: I talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town, I think. A: Yeah, A: I forgot the name of the town. A: I thought maybe it was you A: Oh, well, anyway, we're supposed to talk about education. A: I certainly have some ideas since I'm studying it now in college. A: I'd say, first of all, they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading, writing, arithmetic in grade school, B: Uh-huh. A: because they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to, A: and it shows up. A: That's one idea. A: Do you have any? B: Um, I don't know, B: I'm pretty, I think I'm pretty satisfied with, um, B: I I grew up in Plano A: Uh-huh. B: and, and my dad is actually on the school board there, B: so, I kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on. A: Yeah, A: it's A: Plano, uh, improved greatly in the last twenty, twenty-five years B: Yeah. A: that's for sure. A: It used to be the pits. A: And Arlington is excellent now, A: but I'm just speaking overall across the country. B: Oh. B: Yeah. A: Something is definitely wrong. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, one thing, they don't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing, A: so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year A: and they truly can't read B: Right. A: so I don't know how they expect them to, uh, pass history when they can't read anything, you know, even read a word problem in math. A: So, um, that's definitely a problem. A: Another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do. B: Right. A: But, um, B: So do you, what do you think is good about the schools? A: That is good about, A: well, it depends on where you are. A: They're all so different. A: That's another thing about the United States. B: Yeah. A: There's no national curriculum, you know, A: I mean, what they'd be teaching in an Arlington school they may not be teaching in a Plano school B: Uh-huh. A: and in the same school district, you may, even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance, you may have an English class A: you may have half literature for the whole year, A: whereas in another one they're going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature, B: Grammar. A: it's up to the teacher, in other words. A: So that's kind of you know, that's kind of odd to me. B: Yeah. A: It depends on, uh, what school you're in and who your teacher is, actually B: Uh-huh. A: or is how you end up A: Overall, Arlington is good, one of the better ones in the state, A: so I guess we lucked out when we moved here. B: Uh-huh. B: So, yeah, B: that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. A: Uh-huh. A: Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point, A: and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum? A: I don't know. A: I just read about that the other day, A: and I had never even thought of it. A: Actually it makes sense to a certain extent, A: because sometimes, like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what, uh, A: they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach, you know. and according to her plan, B: Uh-huh. A: so I guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn. B: Right. A: But, uh. We actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes, you know. B: Um. A: That's, that's pretty low that there's forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more more citizens percentage wise that can read and write, B: Yeah. A: so, um, unless we want to keep paying, paying for these people that can't make it in society, we're going to have to do something. A: I don't know. A: Obviously nobody's smart enough to have figured it out yet, A: so I probably can't A: But I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five, six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write A: because they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know. B: Right. A: Uh, you can't, you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something you know, or fill out an application to work at McDonalds if you can't read. B: Uh-huh. Yeah *aa A: So, uh, I think that's, that's a start at least, going back to the basics in the early grades A: and, um, they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago, A: and that's a big jump. B: I believe that A: Did you go to school in Plano? B: I did. A: Through high school. B: Uh-huh, B: uh, A: Up, up there, maybe, maybe you guys don't have as, uh, big a problem with air pollution as many, do you? B: We, we, we have a terrible air pollution problem. A: Do you really? B: Our summers are extremely, uh, hazardous A: Uh-huh. B: and during, uh, certain wind directions because we get the, uh, Gary, Indiana Chicago pollution A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze, uh coming up along the lake. A: That's horrible. A: Uh-huh. B: And they do post, uh, uh, warnings for people who have, uh, heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season. A: Uh-huh. B: In the winter it's not as severe. A: Right. B: But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't think it's going to go very far, B: but it, it was, uh, a way of, uh, triggering, uh, awareness. A: Right, A: right. B: So what's the conditions like in Dallas? A: Well, uh, in Dallas, I, I haven't seen air pollution quite on a, quite on a level that we had in Denver. A: I grew up in Denver, A: and, and I've lived there most of my life, A: and we used to have those, uh, you know, the posted warning days. A: Uh, however, in Colorado now, they have the emissions control law, which has really cut down, A: probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now, you know, as far as health concerns. B: Um. A: Uh, due to that the, the emissions, uh, uh, control on the vehicles, seems that all of our, all of our, uh, smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry. B: Wisconsin has a, a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for, uh, their pollution control equipment, A: Uh-huh. B: and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it, it is drivable. A: Um. B: So, they've, they've tried to do a lot of that A: Uh-huh. B: and I B: you know, there seem to be, at least in certain little pockets, B: and we were talking earlier about Madison A: Uh-huh. B: Madison has one of the nicest, uh, bike, uh, road, uh, sharing programs of, of any city in Wisconsin A: Oh, really. B: and all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of, uh, bike trails for recreational use of any of the states. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And there is a, a real promotion of, of biking A: Uh-huh. B: but, um, there are still a lot of people who insist on, on driving their own automobiles uh, to go everywhere. A: Right. B: I find that a little irritating, because I don't think it's always so necessary. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: it, it becomes, uh, A: maybe to you and I who have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, I think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware, uh, rather quickly of, of what's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is. A: Um, I, I notice people in, in Dallas seem to say, Well, sure, there's air pollution, but, you know, really, how bad is, how bad could this problem really be. B: Send, send them to Wisconsin, B: and we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from, uh, the, uh, acid rain A: Oh really A: Uh-huh. B: and they'll, they'll, they may wake up, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: how'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain. A: Right. A: Right. B: It's, uh, really a serious issue for those of us up in this, uh, sector up, up here. A: Do you find that, um, or, or do you hypothesize that, that most of the, uh, smog or, or air pollution comes from vehicles A: or does it come mostly from industry up there? B: I think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of, of the Gary area A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: that causes the acid rain. B: That I'm a little uncertain of, B: but I do know that, uh, it is a problem. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: I had talked with my parents. A: I, I grew up, uh, I was born in, uh, Muncie, Indiana, and, and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute, A: and I had asked them before, uh, A: I went back to visit recently, about a year ago, A: and I asked them, A: I said, did you ever realize the air pollution that was, A: I'm sorry, um B: That's okay, B: I didn't hear. A: hobbies. B: Okay. A: Let me see, A: I don't know if that took or not, A: I'll do it again. B: Okay. A: Okay. A: What are your hobbies? A: I hear you have kids, right? B: You heard her in the background B: That's babies. A: That's your full time, uh, hobby, right? B: Takes a lot of time, huh. B: I like, uh, most sports. B: I like to do that. B: I kind of like to do a little bit of sewing. A: Uh-huh. B: Oh, little bit of embroidery work, once in a while. A: Uh-huh. B: What do you like to do? A: Um, I try to do some painting, although I'm not very good at it B: Well, I'm sure you probably are. A: Well, no, A: not really. B: You like it, B: that's the main . A: Yeah, A: I, I have, you know, I inherited the genes that make me think I'm creative, but not the ones that give me the ability to be. B: That's right. A: So, I always try. A: I, I do some sewing, mostly out of necessity. A: Um, I'm making drapes for my house, just because I'm, B: Oh, boy, that's hard sewing. A: Yeah, A: well, it isn't and it is. A: It is, you know, A: actually the sewing isn't the hard part, A: it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room. B: Measure it and get it to, B: Well, if it, it depends on how elaborate you get it. B: If you get pleats and all kinds of, A: Yeah, A: I've been doing that A: and, That, B: That's a lot of work. A: yeah, A: that, A: but usually have to do the pleats by hand. A: So that, at least I can do, you know, watching T V or whatever B: Oh. A: but, B: Right, B: right. A: Yeah, A: and I've, I've gone and, you know, put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through A: but, B: That feels really good. A: Yeah, A: so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything, but I, I need to do it. B: To do it, B: right. A: I have, let's see, I have a dog, and a lot of fish. A: Keeping fish, I guess is my biggest hobby. B: Keeping fish . B: Well, they're probably easier than keeping dogs, though, aren't they. A: Um, yes and no. A: It depends on how frequently they die, and how much that bothers you. B: Oh, no. B: How much that bothers you, B: and you probably have to clean out the tank too. A: That's, A: you don't have to do as much as, as I thought. A: In fact, my problem, A: I had fish as a kid A: and they always died immediately, B: Oh, no. A: and, what, I'm, what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean B: Oh, you're kidding A: because you have, B: because they need to have a little bit of the, A: Right, A: you need to let the bacteria build up, A: and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance. B: I see. A: And I would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water B: Oh, no. A: and it would kill all the bacteria, A: and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again B: And so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably. A: so. A: Right. A: That's right. A: So now only, I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing B: Right, B: right. A: and I don't try and sterilize things B: Don't go through the whole nine yards B: and they kind of need a little bit of that. A: That's right. A: That's right. B: So you've had fish for a long time. A: Well, I've had them, A: I guess it's been two years now I've had a, a tank here, A: and then back at home I used to have a small, you know, five gallon tank. A: But that never worked well. I have fifty-five gallons now. *sd B: What size do you have now? B: Oh, that's a good size. A: It's a lot easier. B: Have you ever had it, uh, crack or break or leak. A: No A: No, A: not yet. B: Fifty-five gallons, you'd hope it would never do that. A: That's right, A: I really do. A: But, you know. B: Do you have all kinds of different fish B: or, A: Yeah, A: I just have, you know, what they call community fish guppies, and platies and, and basic things. B: Uh-huh. A: I don't get into the B: Real exotic. A: right, A: right. A: The expensive ones. B: Well, they're probably hardy, harder to take care of B: and, A: They are. A: They're very expensive A: and, you know, when you die, it's like, when they die it's more like an investment. B: Yes, B: I bet it is. A: You lost an investment A: so, B: Do you have problems with them, uh, the fish eating each other? A: No, A: not really. A: Only if there's baby fish. B: Right. A: You always have to isolate those. B: Then you have to, B: how do you isolate them? A: You get a B: A jar or something B: or. A: well, no, A: they have breeders. B: Okay. A: It's a little plastic things that sort of floats B: Okay. A: and you put the mother fish in there A: and then it's got like a trough underneath her B: Okay. A: so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough A: and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either. B: Oh. A: And that's, you know, A: it kind of works, A: but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate B: Right. A: it'll fit out the slots. B: It'll go through the slot. A: That's right, A: so. But, you know, it works, I guess. B: That works all right then. B: They don't, uh, want the mothers to be with the little fish either. A: Oh, they'll eat them. B: They will. A: Yeah. B: Isn't that odd. A: Yes. B: You wouldn't think that. A: It, and it's funny because the one I have, every single month without fail she has babies. B: You're kidding. A: Oh, no. A: All the time, A: and, um, I, A: and she's supposed to, A: her variety, it says they won't eat the babies, A: and I've seen her do it. A: So. B: And that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it? A: Oh, it's A: well, it makes you understand that, you know, things are different B: Things are different in the animal kingdom, huh. A: We might, right. We might decide what's proper and what isn't, A: but you know, that's the way it is for them. B: Yeah. B: That's kind of the way they do it. A: Yeah. A: That's it. B: Survival of the fittest or something. A: Yes, A: because if the baby is strong enough, it can swim away fast enough and go hide. B: Right. B: Go hide from them, B: well and then, you think, well, how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that, A: So. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: but. If you're like me, you never have enough time for the hobbies. I try to be as well, A: Well, I'm not, uh, I, A: there really isn't any kind of particular food that I, I don't, don't like really, A: and I like a good Italian restaurant or a good, uh, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: especially like good prime rib B: Uh-huh. A: so if it's, uh, nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that, A: and I live here in, uh, Rome, New York, A: and there are a lot of good restaurants around here. B: Oh, you're in New York, B: I was going to, B: there's a place, if you ever make it to Dallas they have the best prime rib. A: Uh-huh. B: It's called Lawry's, like Lawry's seasoning salt A: Uh-huh. B: and it is absolutely wonderful. A: Really. B: And, uh, we were there a few months ago, B: and it, I mean, it's kind of pricey, B: well, from New York it probably doesn't matter, B: but A: Oh, no, A: I'm in upstate New York, A: and it's actually very inexpensive, A: I, A: there's a there's a place, um, half a mile from me here that, uh, has, uh, fantastic prime rib for, oh, eleven dollars for a whole meal, you know a potato and salad and soup, and the whole, whole nine yards, B: Oh, is it, okay. B: Wow. B: Uh-huh. A: so that, B: Yeah, B: well, I think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen, B: and it includes, you know, salad and rolls and, oh, some other stuff, B: but it is absolutely wonderful. A: Right. B: It's the best I have ever had. A: Uh, I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had, A: so, I'll have to go there when I get to get to Dallas. B: Yeah B: Well, B: Yeah, B: well, we like, uh, lots of people down here like Mexican food A: Uh-huh, A: sure. B: so, um, that's, B: I, I think Italian and Mexican food are probably my favorites. A: Uh-huh. B: But, um, I'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff. A: No, A: no, A: I'm not into the, the, don't do the, the raw, raw fish like that, A: but I do like, uh, like a seafood bar, like a raw, raw bar like oysters and things like that, uh B: Uh-huh. A: that they, uh, A: I go on, A: I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business B: Oh, okay. A: so I, uh, find myself down in Melbourne, Florida about once, once a month, once every two months or so and, uh, go and hit the, the oyster bars down there quite a bit B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, yeah A: but, I love that, B: fresh seafood down there, A: Yeah, A: and, um, and, uh, Maryland's great, A: you get the crabs B: Uh-huh. A: it's like, I can't go anywhere where I where I don't enjoy myself, B: Yeah A: so, B: Yeah, B: seafood seems to be a a little bit more expensive than, than other types of food. A: That's true. B: But it sure is good, B: and it's supposed to be good for you. A: Yeah, A: well, uh, it's really strange that, that, that seafood is so expensive, because when you, in reality, uh, uh, I, say that, uh, the oceans have the greatest resource of food on the planet, B: Right. A: and yet, we haven't, as human beings, haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically B: Right. A: so, we managed to, uh, figure out how to get at just about everything else, but, uh, but not, uh, not seafood. B: Uh-huh. B: Do you like spicy foods B: or, A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: I like, uh, I make a, a wicked chili A: and around here the big spicy thing is like, uh, buffalo wings B: Oh, uh-huh. A: and so, uh, it, people, they, you know, A: you go out to get the chicken wings A: and those are really hot and the hotter the better, B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Well, we, uh, we like spicy food down here, especially, uh, the hot sauce, Picante sauce, or salsa whatever you all call it A: Right. A: Sure. B: and, uh, we, we sure go through a lot of that A: Yeah. B: But I like it hot, B: but I don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running A: Uh-huh. A: My, generally my, my scalp will start, A: I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot, the weirdest, weirdest sensation, almost like a tingling, A: but, uh, I don't know, A: but, uh, A: yeah, A: well, there isn't, isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like. B: Yeah. A: Things that are kind of oddball, like, uh, Thai cuisine, A: I never been really fond of that stuff. A: You talk about spicy, A: that'll, that'll literally blow your head off, A: it's so hot. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, and I can handle just about any kind of food without, uh, um, A: well, but that, that stuff is, goes one notch beyond, uh, my tolerances, B: Uh-huh A: So. Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the, uh, service in a restaurant is always nice though, too B: Oh, yeah, A: that's one thing, B: and the price. And the price. Make you want to come back. A: What's that? A: Yeah, A: Well, I find that lately that so many people are working, you know, working waitressing jobs or waiter, B: Go ahead. A: Um, I haven't given this a, a lot of thought. A: I'm, uh, that, that's a whole, pleased with the practice that is they, A: I, uh, I don't, A: you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand that's arguable but that, that, uh, people who's jobs are critical to public safety should have to meet special standards. A: Uh, I haven't given this matter enough thought. B: Do you work for T I? A: No, uh, B: Oh. A: I'm in the Washington area. A: I work for N I S T . B: Oh, okay. B: Oh, all right. B: Well, see we have the testing already here. B: We've had it for, oh, about five years. A: Uh-huh. B: It used to just be for new employees. B: And now it's for all employees. A: And now, B: They, uh, randomly select employee numbers B: and, uh, the day that they select you is when you have to go and, and be tested. A: Okay, A: and how do people feel about it? B: So, we're familiar with it. B: Oh, we have a lot of, um, people upset about it at the beginning. Some not all. B: But what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse. Um, mainly the areas where they were doing a lot of, um, manufacturing type things B: and what they ended up doing is, uh, kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening, B: and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing, you know, on the premises. A: Well, okay, A: that's, that's a very different issue. B: Well, yeah, B: it was, you know, combination of, of, uh, both activities and, uh, and using too B: so they developed this, uh, drug policy so that, uh, to eliminate, B: there's some parts of the company that we do, uh, government contracts, B: and I think some of those require the drug testing, B: but now T I thought well, we'll just do it for all employees that, um, not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in B: and that we shouldn't have, um, people on drugs within our, you know, offices and such. A: And, B: I haven't personally ever been tested, B: but I don't have a problem with it. A: Um, does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs? B: No, B: but one thing that to, to me was, um, going on, stretching it a little too far was that they also check, um, if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug. B: You know, it happens a lot of times B: like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever B: and, you know then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the, you know, doctor and get another prescription. A: Well , B: Well, according to what they do at T I, if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name. B: It, you know, it can't be in your spouse's name B: so they will look, I mean, the testing will look for, I guess, any kind of drugs, B: and you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for. A: So they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking? B: Right. B: Yes, B: yes. B: When you get tested you are supposed to tell them, you know, everything that, that might be there. B: And then if they ever, um, question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name. A: Okay. A: Well, it, I mean, it's, I guess that, in fact, they don't test for, for, they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs A: but that I, but they don't say in advance , uh, A: so, B: Well, what they be testing for are the ones that would have like, you know, barbiturates or codeine things like that in them. A: The ones that would kind of constitute controlled substances or something anyway . B: Right, B: right. B: I guess that's what they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and antibiotics and stuff. B: They would be looking for the, yeah, controlled things, barbiturates amphetamines. A: So what they are asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances. B: Right, B: right. B: You pretty much, you know, put down what you remember even if it was just Contact or something like that. B: But afterwards, uh, maybe if you had a controlled substance Well, A: Is Contact a, B: you, you probably put down, you know, you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it. A: Okay. A: Is Contact a, substance? B: No. B: I'm, just saying you probably put down on the sheet anything you have taken. A: Okay. A: Okay. B: But if they had a controlled substance, maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name. B: I know I had one contract employee through Manpower was not a T I person, but was a contract person, A: Uh-huh. B: and they test them too even if you are not a real, uh, T I B: If you are a contract employee here they test you too. A: Uh-huh. B: And he had taken some kind of, um, oh, you know, uh, B: just, he had some kind of flu or something. B: He got a real bad migraine B: and he took his mother's, A: All right. A: What is your favorite show? B: Well, I was just trying to think. B: When they called, I didn't have as much time to prepare for this as I did some of the others. B: Um, I love watching some of the, uh, new, new shows basically. A: Uh-huh. B: And we, uh, we subscribe to C N N B: and we took that, B: and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake, B: and I have gotten stuck on a lot of this. B: The new shows and the stuff that comes on that, that it, you know, B: like the, uh, at night the discussion talk shows and things. A: Uh-huh. B: And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current, uh, especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here. A: Sure. B: We have little ones. B: Uh, we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE, A: Uh-huh. B: and we think that's kind of informative to teach them, how to handle things in situations. A: It really is. A: Uh-huh. B: What do you watch? A: I watch just about anything, but not a lot of, T V. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean I'll watch, you know, maybe a little while when I first get home in the evening. B: Uh-huh. A: And I usually watch, you know, the news A: and then I'll watch that HARD COPY or or that kind of thing, you know, B: Uh-huh. B: That's the same thing we do. A: and I like the NINE ONE ONE, and UNSOLVED MYSTERIES. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: that kind, that's the kind I like really more than, the sitcoms. A: Uh-huh. B: I haven't gotten, into many of those. A: Now, I do, like, A: my husband is really crazy about EVENING SHADE that comes on, on Monday evening. B: I have heard that's real good. A: And I, uh, B: That's, Burt Reynolds, isn't it? A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I've heard that. A: And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny. B: Now someone told me that B: and also, uh, I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN, because they said that that was really good this season. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, his favorite night is Monday night A: so we've got to where we will sit, and watch it on Monday night, B: You've got to yeah, B: Uh-huh. A: because that and then that, uh, oh, A: I can't even think of the name of it. A: Like I say I'm not, B: DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night, too. A: Yeah, A: and the one with the, the sergeant that married the woman with the kids, Sergeant McGillis . B: Huh, I don't even know. A: Sergeant, uh, MAJOR DAD. B: Oh, okay. B: Now I, we've never even seen that. A: Yeah, A: that comes on right after, uh, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN, and DESIGNING WOMEN. B: Uh-huh. A: So we always, he watches that A: and I kind of I watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others, as I can. B: On the others. B: Well, you know, on Friday nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY. A: Uh-huh. B: Or, um, A: Uh-huh. B: It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS LANDING. A: Yeah. B: But, uh, we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot. B: Oh, excuse me just a minute to someone in the B: The money is right there on the thing and the coupon. A: Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around though. B: Oh, I know. B: That's the thing. B: And so, we, A: Except they, probably are in bed, by nine. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, they are. B: In fact, on weeknights they are in bed by eight, B: but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off. A: Did you get your pizza taken care of? B: Yeah, B: he has gone to get it. B: Thank you B: Um, but I was to say on Saturdays there is absolutely nothing B: and that's the day my husband, wants to . A: Well, do you know, A: I have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that I've really liked A: and that's SISTERS. A: Have you watched that? B: No, B: but I saw that advertised today B: and it sounds like it's not fluff. B: It sounds like it's good. A: It's really, you know, it's really pretty good. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean, it's kind of like, you know, um, soap opera I guess. B: Yeah, B: that's what they said it was kind of, a little more drama to it. A: But it's a, A: So far it, I've watched it about three times now A: and it's really held my attention. A: It's been pretty good. Some, pretty good acting. B: Well, and and another one now that it's getting darker B: and you are wanting to cocoon more, B: that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE. B: Some of these, that are nostalgic. A: Now I watched, BROOKLYN BRIDGE this week for the first time, B: Did you, like it? A: but I haven't, A: I did. A: I liked it. B: Did you? B: Well, they said that one and I'LL FLY AWAY are really quality, you know B: and, A: Now I haven't seen I'LL FLY AWAY yet. B: I haven't seen it either. B: I think what I need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then I get my bath it's, you know, it's almost too late to start, something new. A: Uh-huh. A: It's nearly, too late for T V. B: Yeah. A: That's the way I am. A: I get in, from work B: Yeah. A: and I'm tired A: and I sit and watch for a few minutes A: so I have to get up and do dinner, and everything. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights. A: Uh-huh. B: So, it's like, we are kind of, tuned out of our T V. A: Yeah. A: That's us. A: If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos, A: so. B: Yeah, B: well, we do too. A: But there are some good shows on. A: I, I really probably should watch more of them than I do. B: Yeah. A: But I like, A: I don't know A: I, I'm always in to making things A: and, And I don't just spend all my time, B: I don't know, B: yeah. B: There's a lot more to do with, with your time when you get into it. A: and I, my husband, now he sits and watches T V constantly. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, my, my sister and them and her husband do on weekends. B: They don't have children yet, B: and they just turn it on when they walk in, B: they turn it off when they leave. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: So they are used to that too. A: I could be around here for hours by myself and never have it on. B: Yeah, B: I understand. B: Same here. A: But, uh, but there are some really good new shows that I have enjoyed, A: and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week. B: Yeah, B: it's real good. B: And then of course, in the afternoons if I get in from work in time I watch OPRAH, some of those, you know, talk shows. A: Yeah. B: I like her. A: I never get in in time for any of those. B: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: Well, it's, it's nice talking to you. B: I guess we've kind of exhausted this one, B: but it's nice talking with you. A: Well, it's nice talking with you. B: Thank you. A: Bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Uh, I guess it's, uh, A: watching the the T V today there had a lot of stuff on, on, uh, crime. A: In our state right now, uh, recently they've had a lot of, uh, uh, the rapists, uh, murder type, uh, killers going around A: and well, I, I, B: Oh, gracious. A: they've caught them A: and they, they're in there. B: Uh-huh. B: Wasn't it your state that had the, uh, guy that committed all those murders? B: There was that, uh, A: Well, yeah, A: Wisconsin, uh, and Milwaukee area, you know. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: that was really on the national news a lot. B: We heard a lot about that in Texas. A: Yeah. A: So that's, A: well, I, I live right on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin A: so I kind of get both, both news A: and, I know, in Minnesota, uh, they had, uh, the one that just, uh, got out and went after a, uh, college student and raped, and killed her B: Oh. A: and they are not too happy about that now, I guess, A: so. B: Well, I can imagine. A: There . B: It seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me. B: I, I don't know. B: I don't know if statistically they are B: but it seems like you sure hear a, maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news B: I don't know. A: Yeah, A: uh, that's hard to say for sure. A: I, uh, sometimes I wonder if these people aren't don't it just for the publicity A: and, They, they get their names in the, in the paper B: You wonder about that sometimes. A: and they become big celebrities. A: But, B: Uh-huh. B: That's kind of scary. B: I, I wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories. B: Maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas. A: Well, uh, I know one I, I think Texas has the death penalty, right? B: Yes, B: we do. A: Yeah. B: Do you have it up there? A: No, A: no. B: I see. A: See I, I B: Do you think that's a deterrent? A: Yeah, A: well, it's, it's, it's not going to prevent any people from doing it A: but, the person that's caught, he'll never do it again if he gets the death penalty. B: Yeah. A: And that's, A: and there are a lot of repeaters. Uh, B: Uh-huh. B: I guess that's another thing that to me is a, a real problem, B: and I know we have got so many people in our prison system now, at least here in Texas A: Yeah. B: I mean, they are really in a crisis. B: There has been times they have had to just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them. A: Yeah. B: And a lot of them they put out on parole B: and then some of the ones that they put out early, you know, do repeat offenses B: and, the crime rate is the worst than ever before. A: Huh. A: Yeah. A: Well, some, I'm just wondering a lot of times they will put, uh, people, lesser crimes in, uh, with, uh, people that did more severe crimes A: than they, maybe they just tend to learn from these people A: and they, and when they get back out, they just go into worse crimes. B: I think that could be true too. A: Maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more. Uh, B: I think the whole parole thing, you know, if somebody is convicted of second-degree murder or something gets fifteen years, well, they are out in six or seven. You know, outbound on the streets again A: Yeah. B: And to me that's really scary. B: Some of these crimes that they commit, you know, seems like the punishment is not really equal to the crime. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, uh, I don't know with, with my limited, uh, psychology background I do have, I don't, I don't even feel that prisons and stuff are, are the answer. A: If you want to stop the crime, I think you've got to get, uh, the people when they are kids. B: Oh, yeah. A: A lot of this probably just starts with, from the, from the homes. Also from the, the, the media, the T V the, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: all these, uh, gory movies on there becomes, uh, just a natural fact of life. B: Uh-huh. B: They think it's okay thing to do. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I think that's a very good point. B: You know, I, B: there's a lot more working mothers, a lot more kids in day care centers all that kind of thing. B: Morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore. B: And, A: Uh-huh. A: Well, a lot of the European countries, uh, they tend to sensor, A: well, they probably won't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent. B: Uh-huh. A: And they have a lot less crime. B: Huh. A: Some of, some of those European countries are, are, you can leave your, your, uh, doors open and, and, and be safe. A: Uh, even, uh, I think New Zealand is one of, one of the places, uh, that, B: Well, Sid, B: have you established what kind of requirements you are looking for, for your next vehicle? A: Well, I don't know if I really have a, a lot of, uh, requirements. A: Uh, I guess I look at, uh, getting the best deal. A: Uh, that's my main objectives normally. Whoever is willing to deal and, and give me a good price. B: Okay. B: Well, I, I tend to be more methodical I guess. B: Uh, I determine first of all what I'm going to use the vehicle for, whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a, a personal mover. Uh, where it's going to be driven, you know, what types of, uh, driving I'm going to be doing on it, primarily highway or, or local mileage more often. B: And, uh, hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that I tend to drive cars for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles. A: Uh-huh. B: So I'm, I'm real picky. B: if you are going to keep something that long, you know, you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that you are going to like for a long time. A: Yeah. A: I don't know I've had pretty good luck, you know, A: even if, if you take any car and, and you care for it well enough, uh, you are going to get some good life out of it. A: Uh, my, my Oldsmobile right now that I have, uh, is getting near eighty thousand A: and it's still in pretty good shape. A: Uh, there was a flaw in there where a, where a head gasket bolt broke, A: and it cost me some bucks to, to fix that A: but that was, you know, something that was unforeseen. A: But I still think I I'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it. B: Sure. B: Well, it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways also then. A: Well, I, I drive like the song says, THE LITTLE OLD LADY but, uh, but not FROM PASADENA A: But, uh, A: yeah, A: I, I baby them as much as I possibly can. A: Uh, it's a pretty big expense nowadays. A: Uh, and I guess I like to take care of it, uh, A: so I don't have to buy one too often. B: That's true. B: Uh, do you have more than, than one vehicle in your fleet? B: Uh, do you have a family fleet B: or, A: Yeah, A: I, I, I got an old, uh, seventy-six, uh, Grand Fury that, uh, doesn't want to die on me A: so I, I just keep running the thing. Don't want to sell it or get rid of it until it quits, A: but it just doesn't seem to want to. A: I'll probably have, uh, three, four hundred thousand before it wants to die. B: Well, that may be. B: They, Chrysler made some really good old engines back then B: like the, the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine. A: Oh. I've got the big three sixty in there, gas guzzler A: but it runs good. B: Yeah. B: At the moment I've got, uh, Cadillac Cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a, uh, reasonably new Plymouth Voyager. B: It's only a, a couple of years old. B: But that's the second one of, of those that we've had, B: and that's the, the family travel vehicle. B: You know, not only does it do all the, the, uh, carpooling around during the week, B: but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in. B: I think that what I'm getting ready to get next is probably a Suburban unless they drastically change the, the vehicle a lot. B: Uh, I'm just getting tired of when I do get hung up in traffic, not being able to determine what the problem is and, and come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit and that kind of stuff. Just because I can't see, you know, A: Yeah. B: I'm to, my Cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that I can't see past any vehicle that's in front of me. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Well, I'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle. A: Uh, I just have so many hauling projects a lot of times A: and, uh, I, I'd like to just start doing some, uh, carpentry, uh, type work around. A: I just feel that, A: So, so what have you seen lately that, um, you think is worthwhile? B: Um, the last movie I saw was REGARDING HENRY. B: Have you seen that yet? A: No, A: I, I saw the previews. B: It's really good. B: I loved it. B: Um, it's, um. A: Does, does he, does it have a happy ending, A: or. B: Yeah, B: really good ending A: Uh-huh. B: um, uh, it was the, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. B: I generally don't get into movies that much, B: but I saw that one, B: and then before that one, I saw, um, oh, NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF. A: Oh, that was funny, wasn't it B: Yeah, B: did you, have you seen that one? A: Yes, A: and, and, and, and the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and, you know. B: Yeah, B: it's exactly like AIRPLANE wasn't it A: Yes. B: But it was silly. A: Right. A: So, now these are for two very different movies. A: One, one, uh, absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly, you know, serious subject. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: I, I guess I have similarly broad tastes. A: Um, my most recent, um, movie that I, that I liked a lot, not my most recent movie, was HENRY THE FIFTH. A: I only rented it, you know, maybe a month ago B: Uh-huh. A: and it's been out for a couple of years, A: but. Have you seen that? B: I haven't seen that yet. A: Well, it's, it's a, it's an adaptation of the, of the Shakespeare play, A: and it's beautifully done. A: Um, I believe that all the language is as Shakespeare wrote it, except it's been shortened a little bit A: and there might be a word or two changed. B: Right. A: Uh, but it's, it's, it's a glorious movie B: Um. Such as A: um, and I like, as you know, these, these, these silly movies, A: and I also like just some strange movies. A: Do you have any. A: Well, the, the one that comes immediately to mind, I, um, is the THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, HER LOVER. A: Um, but there are also these various, um, David Lynch movies. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, I got, I got hooked on TWIN PEAKS. A: That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on. B: Oh, really. B: I haven't seen any of those. A: Oh. A: Um well, I don't, I don't especially recommend, B: They're really good? A: I mean, you have, you have to just sort of like this thing, A: you have to like, A: did you see TWIN PEAKS? B: Huh-uh, B: no. A: No, A: so, okay. A: So, if you weren't, if you weren't drawn to watch that, you, maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies, either. B: Uh-huh. A: They're, they're just strange. B: Are they, I mean, is it, like mystery, or suspense A: Well, uh. I think suspense is the right word. B: or, A: Uh, and, but, but, a little bit strange and esoteric A: and, uh, in the case of TWIN PEAK a little, there's some elements of the supernatural in it, too. B: Oh really. A: That was the television show. B: Um. A: Um, there's also a, a a producer of movies in Baltimore called, um, John Walters, who, who puts, puts on even weirder movies. A: Uh, his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream, like HAIR SPRAY. A: Um, but back in his early days, he, he, he had things, um, um, A: what, what are the titles, A: I can't remember the titles any more. But, some really weird ones, uh, with quite a random crew of, of characters. A: Um, it would have made, you know, these Fellini movies look normal. B: Right. B: So do you like, um, movies a lot? B: See I don't do, B: I don't. A: I do, I do like movies a lot. B: Right. B: See, I don't do that, B: I don't go to movies that often, B: but, just recently I've been to a couple A: Do, do you rent them, A: or. B: Um, no, B: we, I just go to like the dollar movie theater around here generally, A: Yes. B: but, I don't know, B: I just, I usually fall asleep B: or I get bored pretty easily B: so. A: Yeah, A: that's what my wife does too, um, A: I mean, she falls asleep B: Uh-huh. A: So we have to, we have to pick just the right kind of movie to, to, to, to appeal. B: Yeah. B: Right, B: that's exactly right. A: Well, well it was good talking to you. B: Yeah, B: it's good to talk to you, too. A: Take care. B: Uh-huh. A: Okay, A: bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Okay, A: did they tell you our topic? B: Uh, no, B: somebody else answered the phone and put my number in. A: Okay, A: it's, uh, B: Uh, what is the topic? A: The topic is cars. A: What kind of car will you buy next A: and what kind of decision you'd, do you think about getting, you know, pick that car out and, uh, and why. B: Okay. B: Uh, my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac. A: Okay. B: I've had, uh, B: well, I'm on my third one. B: And I'm not real sure that I'd be in the market for a car for quite a while. A: Yeah, A: I'm the same way. A: I was, uh, I had two Cadillacs. A: I went to my first Lincoln this last time. A: I travel A: and, uh, my grandfather worked for Ford Motor Company A: so he always said why don't you drive a Ford, or why don't you try a Lincoln B: Uh-huh. A: so I finally tried one after fifty years B: My, A: and, uh, I've had, I guess, I guess four Cadillacs and, and one Suburban in my last five cars, A: but I bought a Lincoln A: and I like it. B: My dad has been a, a, uh, Lincoln man for a lot of years, B: but I've always been a G M man. B: I'm in the auto parts business myself. A: Oh, are you? B: And, uh, the last Cadillac I bought was an Allante. A: Uh-huh. B: And I just love it to death. B: I'm not sure I'd ever get rid of it. A: Well, I'm a, I'm a traveling salesman. A: I travel on the road A: so I like a little heavier car A: but, B: I used to do that quite a bit myself. A: So that's why I choose, you know, to drive a heavier car and more luxury car. B: Yeah. A: But, I tell you what, A: I will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly. B: Really? A: Yeah, A: because I like the Lincoln A: but, there's just something about that Cadillac that, whether it's a G M C product or whatever. Seems they handle better. B: They seem to put, They seem to be put together a little bit better. A: I think so, too. B: And, you know, the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products B: and I think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from, uh, imports is they put so much, you know, gadgetry on the dash B: and, and the, the buttons are so small to push A: Yeah, A: they really do. B: and G M doesn't seem to do that. B: I kind of like that feature, B: so. A: You know, I'm a funny duck A: that came, it comes to the simple things like front end alignments B: Uh-huh. A: I have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac. A: I don't know why, why whether I just seem to drive them better or what, B: Uh-huh. A: but, I've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac. A: They always appear to hold well. B: I've, uh, I had an Eldorado, was my first one, was an eighty A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, I think at about sixty thousand miles I finally had it lined up. A: Did you. B: And I had them do all four wheels. A: And the only thing I miss about a Cadillac is, A: a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car A: and I traded it in, traded it in on my Lincoln A: and they're just not as large as before. A: I do miss that. B: That's true, B: yeah. B: But, what is big today. A: Well, you're right. B: You know. Lincoln is still as big as it always has been B: but, A: Yeah, A: it's big, A: but the trunk space for me, uh, A: what I usually do is I usually take the back seat out of my car A: and that's where I put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough. B: You know a car I ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental. A: Yeah, A: now, I have the Town Car A: and it's, it's a deep trunk, but not as broad as the, uh, the Cadillac. B: Well, the Town Car, I noticed, uh, B: or with the, with the Continental, uh, I was, rented one, one time uh, we could, uh, put golf clubs in them. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, good. B: You know, straight across. B: I mean, A: They went all the way down? B: Front to back. A: Well, that's good. B: Not going from side to side. A: That's good. B: And we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage. A: Yeah, A: I sell sporting goods, uh, hunting related items, A: I sell guns, gun cases and things like that B: I see. B: Yeah. A: and I need to, you know, A: that's about the same size as a golf club. B: Uh-huh. A: They need to, samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that A: and, B: I don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental. A: Nope. B: Uh, it's not as peppy as a, as a Town Car A: Right. B: because it's a V Six, B: but it, uh, B: I I drove it from here to Memphis B: and I really enjoyed driving that car. B: If I was going to buy a Ford product, that's what I would buy. A: Yeah. A: I drove mine a couple weeks ago to our, one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville. A: I usually fly. A: I drove it with another one of my guy that worked for me. A: We drove it ten hours to Nashville, A: and it, it handled real well, A: but, my main thing is space, A: so if a Continental, A: I might consider it the next time, A: a Continental has more trunk space. B: You might take a look at them. B: They, they had a, a lot more trunk space. B: As a matter of fact, they had more trunk space than my, uh, Sedan De Ville had. A: You always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs? B: Uh, all three of mine have had leather interiors, B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: I like leather interiors also. B: Uh, I had a eighty Eldorado, which was leather B: and, uh, then my eighty-six was a touring sedan. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it had the gray leather package in it B: and my Allante has, uh I guess saddle, saddle colored type thing. A: That's a nice car. A: You bet, A: and I'll, I will say one thing about Cadillacs versus, A: Uh, so my favorite team is about the Rangers. B: Is it? B: I'd have to agree with that. B: They are my favorite team, too. A: Yeah. B: A little disappointing the last few years. A: I'm telling you. A: You think they'll sign Ruben? B: You know I really don't. A: No? B: I just don't think, you know, with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money, twenty-seven or twenty-nine million or whatever it was, I just don't think that they're going to be able to sign Ruben Sierra B: and it's just going to be a shame for, you know, our area. A: Right. A: Yeah, A: I think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other, uh, Hispanic players. B: Oh, I do, too. B: I just, A: I think that's going to be the big problem. B: The main thing, B: It's just going to effect on the, the team, you know. A: Right. B: We just can't seem to, you know, B: I think we've been in this spot, B: I think we finished second once or maybe even twice. B: I don't know, B: I I'm, I haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years. A: Yeah. B: It's just, it's just too disappointing. B: I just watch them fall every year. A: Right. B: I was a Pete Incaviglia fan B: and, uh I liked him, A: Oh. B: but, of course, I understand baseball decisions are all just, B: decisions like that have to be made by someone B: Glad it's not me making them. A: Right A: I think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here. A: But, B: They say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentine will be there. A: Right. A: Right, A: yeah. B: So, and that's the name of the game, too. B: You got to make money. You know, pay these players so much money, A: Right. B: now, it's just it's frightening. A: Right. B: You and I should be so lucky to, you know, to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that. A: That's true. A: But, uh, they were talking about trading him, if they're not able to sign him and, uh, use the money that it would take to sign the guy, you know, to pay for pitchers or, you know, what it, what it, what they, what else they need. A: Because they've got the hitting, A: but they need the pitching. B: Yeah, B: they really do. A: Um. B: I think they, uh, I think they need them all. B: I just don't I understand the big cities, like in New York or L A or somewhere because big cities B: and, you know, a guy, a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a at a men's clothing store, or something, or sporting goods store, A: Oh, I know. B: but, I realize the difference, B: but, I just don't understand, A: Yeah, A: it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working, you know, your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game. B: Oh, I know. B: I tell you. A: It's real aggravating, A: but, B: But, one thing I don't understand is why a group, you know, headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them B: because I tell you, we need a winner in this town. B: It looks like our Cowboys are coming back B: but, So that's, that's going to be a big help to Dallas, A: That's right. B: but, you know, in the past half a dozen years, all we've had is the, uh the soccer team. A: It's always got, A: Yeah, A: it's always, it's always wondered me why, I mean, they act as though this area is not, you know, a big metropolitan area, A: but you think we'd, someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the, the, the players we need. B: Oh, I know. B: It's, A: Just real aggravating to A: because I've lived here, you know, since, well, I was born and raised here, A: so I've been a Ranger fan since about seventy-seven, A: so it's a lot of losers B: Oh, I know. A: It's about to get, you know as bad as the Cubs or whoever, you know. B: I've been one, B: Yeah, B: I've been, I've lived here since seventy-four B: and I've really been a Ranger fan for the longest time B: and excuse me, I don't miss a time picking up the morning paper and checking the box score. A: Right. B: I mean I follow them B: and I follow them like I follow the Mavericks and like I follow the Cowboys, B: but, and I want to see them win, because you know, damn it, they, the fans deserve it. B: I mean, it, You know, we have pretty, uh, great fans, put two million people in that stadium. A: Right. A: I'm telling you. B: I love Nolan Ryan. B: I guess you probably love him, too. A: Right, A: I think this town would go crazy if they ever got a, even a playoff team. B: Oh, I do, too. A: I mean, It would be packed. A: And they got that new stadium they are building. A: So, at least, at least that will be exciting when we get that, B: It will. A: but, B: Well, where do you think they are heading this year? A: Uh, it's hard to say. A: It's going to be depending on where the, what they do with Ruben Sierra A: and, uh, I mean, I'm getting tired of them going into each year saying, you know, Bobby Witt is the answer and Kevin Brown is the answer, B: Right A: and, man, that's getting old, you know. A: These guys have been pampered. A: I mean, it's time to, to either, you know, put out or shut up. B: Yeah, B: Bobby Witt gets forced into wins like seventeen games or whatever A: And, B: and they have the later ten game winning streak A: Right. B: and they give him all kinds of money B: and then he just goes right down the tubes. A: And Valentine and Greave, they're about to get, you know, they're about to get old. A: But I like this Sandy Johnson. A: Hello. B: Yes, B: I forgot we had to hit one B: Our time will be up. A: Well, I hit one and nothing happened. A: What's going on? B: Well, just go ahead and talk, B: that's all. A: Are you sure? B: Yeah. A: Don't they usually tell you to say something? B: I don't think so. A: Oh. B: Uh-huh. A: Okay, A: we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden. B: Yes, B: I'm, I'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden. A: What do I do? B: Uh-huh. A: Well, I, uh, I cut it occasionally. B: Good. B: Uh-huh, B: you're ahead of me. A: Is, uh, is that good? A: Okay. B: That's better. A: And I edge it occasionally. B: Oh, that's really good. A: Yeah, A: see, am I good, or what? B: Yeah. A: And, uh, Uh, much beyond that I don't do B: I don't do any of that. B: Really, B: well, I call my lawn man, Eric, whatever his name is, I can't remember. Who's going to come and build me a fence, too. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, he is going to build you a fence. B: Well, he's giving me an estimate. A: Uh-huh. B: And for ten dollars a week, I don't see any reason for me to be doing it. A: What, for a fence? A: Oh, well, I thought, isn't he the same one? B: he is. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: but ten dollars, or what what does he charge, not even that. B: What does he charge me? A: Well, my, A: I don't know. B: It's like next to nothing. B: it's ten because I, B: it's forty a month. A: Yeah. B: But if there's five weeks, I still pay forty. A: Yeah, A: but you know, you ought to get him to pull the weeds. B: Well, he won't pull weeds. B: He says he'll spray them, B: but he won't pull them. A: Oh. B: Uh, he won't cut them is what he won't do. Because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the, the trimmer over the rocks A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: and he's right. A: Yeah. B: That's true. B: But he just says to keep spraying them so, A: Well so, B: Anyway, Gene sprayed them once or twice for me B: so that was real, A: Yeah, A: so you haven't, you haven't pulled any weeds lately? B: No. B: No. B: There are two out front B: I thought I'd grab one of these days, B: but I haven't bothered as I walk on by. A: Yeah. B: I started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front A: Uh-huh. B: and all of a sudden I came cross this big clump of weeds B: and there was dog dirt in it A: Oh, oh, goody. B: and I threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there B: and I left the whole thing B: and that was about a month ago. A: I thought you were going to say there I thought you were going to say there was a snake in the weeds B: I would rather a snake, B: no A: Oh, God, oh B: I just left the whole thing. B: The bag is still out there because I haven't touched it. A: Yeah. B: I haven't gone back over there. B: It really made me mad. A: Oh, God. B: So anyway but, A: But, uh, how are your, your flowers, your little things you planted? A: Did they die or what? B: Oh, yeah, B: now they died. A: Oh, they're all, A: so they, oh, A: are they going to come back in the spring? B: I don't know. A: Oh. B: I don't know, B: and then I got some nice, uh, mums at Thanksgiving that I put in the pots out there A: Uh-huh. B: and I thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather. A: Yeah. B: They looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas, B: then they started to die, too. A: Oh. B: So, I don't think any of it comes back B: but I don't know, A: Yeah. B: maybe these, B: sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to. A: I don't know, uh, B: So, A: Those flowers, remember those little ones you gave me? B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: well, they're, I know they were still blooming up until about a, a few weeks ago. B: Really? A: Yeah. B: Well, that's good. B: They're the best kind. A: Yeah A: they, They're really pretty. B: They, they're like indestructible. B: They really grow nice B: and sometimes, they're not supposed to come back, B: but lots of times they do. A: Uh-huh. B: So, A: Yeah B: We'll see. B: They're letting us have a lot of time on this aren't they? A: Yeah, A: I mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes? B: But that's because we didn't hit one for a long time. A: We didn't disconnect, did we B: I hope not B: Neither one of us is getting paid for this. A: Boy, I hate to think I hate to think I'd be talking to you without getting paid B: Yeah, B: really, B: I know it. B: I can't believe this. B: I got somebody from Utah and somebody, A: What? A: Uh-huh. B: where was the person last night was from far away. A: You're kidding? A: Really? B: And we get each other down the street. B: This is so funny. A: Well, the, uh, A: I, I talked to someone woman from Oklahoma City and some woman from Dallas A: and that was it. B: Yeah, B: I've had Dallas, Arlington. B: I've had, uh, one Plano and then a lady from Brigham, Utah whose son lives in Plano on Ranier someplace. And then, uh, another state, A: Uh-huh. A: Wow. A: Really? B: I can't remember, B: but she told me about the Utah Jazz, B: we talked about basketball. A: Oh, really B: And I don't remember what, what the place was last night, B: but I'm thinking Colorado, A: Yeah. B: but I'm not sure B: I'd know the place, anyway. A: Uh-huh. B: So, A: I don't know, B: But mostly they're from the area. A: Yeah. B: It, A: Well, there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes. B: Not for me. A: Not for me either. B: You know, not not for me because all I have is rocks and weeds. A: What do I, A: Yeah, A: but I don't, you know, A: I, what do I do, cut it one, you know, and, and edge it A: and that's about it. B: I know. A: What do I do with it? B: I know, B: we're not typical Texans. A: No. A: What's going on, A: are they going to tell us to stop or what B: I don't know, B: I hope so. B: Come on, B: come on. A: Isn't it five minutes? B: I don't know. A: I, I mean, I'm all talked out about gardens. B: I know. B: Well, we can talk about something else. B: It's just a suggested topic. A: Oh, oh, it's just suggested? B: So, how's the baby, do you think A: What? B: How's the, A: We could talk, Let's talk about the baby. B: Let's talk about the baby. A: Do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan? B: Yeah, B: our budgeting plan includes me getting a job B: We're, we're at the point now, B: I I quit working about six months ago to start this house A: Uh-huh. B: and I'm out of cash B: and I'm not out of project yet. A: Oh, no. B: So, uh, I'm going to go back and do some consulting work. B: As far as budget's concerned, I'm, I'm fairly fortunate. B: Uh, we've, we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra, we can make it on what my wife makes. B: So, you know, the project's kind of halted until then. B: But as far as budgeting is concerned, you know, we have, uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, you know, B: we always put ten percent back, B: and that's a never touch. A: Uh, into savings. B: Yeah. A: Oh. B: Either savings or investment, one of the two, B: but we don't ever put it in a high risk. B: It's just always going to be there. A: Well, that's pretty good. B: And as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, uh, what I would call extravagant expenses, you know, B: we, uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food A: Boy, that's pretty good. B: and the rest of it, you know, we pile into the house. B: And, uh, you know, I'm fairly fortunate. B: I mean, our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm a little behind on that, A: Sure. B: but, uh, we're still making the payments on them. B: It's just, when you, B: see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home and do it yourself. A: Yeah, A: it's, it's tough here too. A: You have to have the contractor sign grades A: Uh-huh. B: and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program. A: Huh. B: And I just didn't think that was going get it. B: I thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead, uh, every day. But yet still be with his peers age wise. A: Right. A: Still enjoy the, A: Right. A: Uh, one thing I think I've noticed is, uh, my oldest is in kindergarten, A: so I'm in a little different ballgame. B: You're just getting started. A: I'm just, starting her, A: but, uh, seems to me that, uh, kids these days, uh, can really get away with murder A: and the teachers don't have as much, aren't respected as much A: and, uh, they have to be so careful of the things they do and say. B: Yeah, B: I know. B: That's a big problem. A: And, uh, makes me a little nervous that, uh, students don't seem to show that respect A: and, B: We wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school. A: No! A: Heavens, A: no. B: Wouldn't have thought of it B: and and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe A: No, A: you wouldn't. B: and, A: And, uh, the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what I understand, uh, A: I think that's wrong. A: I think we need to get back to the, show some respect A: and, course, I guess the teacher used to warrant that A: but, B: Yeah, B: but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be, basic respect for for elders and adults and particularly in, in responsible positions have not, uh, I don't think have, had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases A: Right. A: For other people A: and, B: and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands. A: Well, how do you think that that's happened? A: You think our society's just, uh, stopped talking out, A: or this, uh generation's just kind of changed a little bit, uh, B: I guess, I, B: Well, the world changes, B: so I mean, obviously, kids are not the same now as they used to be. A: Right. B: I mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things. B: They have a whole lot more, uh, variety of things they they're, that they see and do at an earlier age, B: so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time, B: but, but still, I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to, to teach, uh, basic values and basic, uh, respectful of, uh, of authority. A: Right. B: And I just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore, uh, A: That just isn't coming through is it. A: No. A: I mean, I remember, uh, well, it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi's. A: We used to have to wear dresses B: Yeah, B: had to wear dresses, didn't you? A: and then you had to, go to dresses, A: they had to be a pantsuit A: and it was polyester A: and it had to be matching A: and, B: And when it was skirts, it was like, get down on the floor B: and we hold the ruler up here A: Yes. B: and it's no more than so many inches above the knee A: Exactly. A: Yes. B: Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time. A: Yes, A: so it's really changed. A: It's, uh, really kind of gone the rounds, A: so I think that maybe that's effected it to some degree. A: They say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit, A: so I, B: Yeah, B: I think that probably does have, have something to do with it, B: and it's also, A: Do, uh, does this school your son goes to, do they, uh, require to wear a uniform A: or, B: No, B: they do not do uniforms, although one, where he was between like second and eighth grade did. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: there are quite a few of your B: Okay A: Yeah. B: Well, considering you moved here from California, I guess, the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have down there. A: Yeah, A: we have, uh, in California, A: I'm in I lived in central California. A: We have rain couple times a year A: and other than that, you know, it would be maybe October and then in the spring A: and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain. So, B: Especially the last few years. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: It's kind of, it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it, uh, A: Yeah, A: there has. A: So here, I know that, uh, last year there was some ice storms while I was out of the state A: and I'm glad to see there haven't been any this year. B: Yet A: Yeah, A: yet A: Still could come, A: huh. B: Generally if we're going to get them, it's not going to happen, uh, prior to January one. A: Uh-huh. B: You may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in December, B: but usually the bitterest weather, if we're going to have any, comes in January and February. A: Yeah. A: Um. B: Then by March things are getting warm again, B: so we really don't have, as long a cold season, I guess as people up north. A: Yeah, A: yeah A: it's so hard to predict here. B: It's been eighty degrees on Christmas day here before. A: Yeah. B: Lots of times. A: Well, today it's not bad out there. B: No, B: it's nice. B: I just came in from outside A: Uh-huh B: and it's, it's really pretty. B: It's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out before it rains again. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: I'm a, I'm a scoutmaster B: and so I wind up going out camping with, uh, a bunch of boys at one time B: and so, it's better for us if it hasn't been this totally wet before we go A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: So you do that even in January, huh? B: Oh, yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: we camp year round. A: Yeah, oh, A: that's interesting. B: But, uh, It's, uh, it's definitely different. A: Uh-huh B: And then, I guess you've been through a couple of summers here, too, right? A: Yeah, A: I have A: and they're not too pleasant A: It gets so humid. A: To me it's humid here. A: People that I know that come from, uh, like Georgia or North Carolina, Yeah, they say, it's, B: Oh, it is. B: It's not as humid. As Houston, say, or Atlanta, B: but it, But more humid than Arizona A: Yeah. A: But I find it, B: and California for the most part. A: Right. B: Were you northern California? A: I was central California. B: Central. A: Central valley. A: It's very dry there. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Well, it's pretty hot in the summer. A: It's in the usually, you know, A: for a good three, four weeks we have over a hundred degrees. B: But it's a drier, A: But it's a dry heat, yeah. B: Hundred when you have a hundred here, everybody's dying A: Uh-huh, A: yeah, A: I know. Well, I lived in Africa for a couple years in Cameroon B: Oh. A: and that's a tropical climate A: and it really feels similar to this during the summer. B: What types of, What type, what type of business takes you to those climates B: or was that just vacation or something? A: No, A: I was, uh, working with, uh, I still work with Wycliff Bible Translators. B: Oh. A: It's an organization where we are looking to translate the BIBLE into languages of the world that aren't yet written. B: Not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages. A: Right, A: languages that don't have anything written yet. A: So this is like the first thing that's written down A: or you know, first an alphabet is developed B: Oh. A: and then, uh, B: That's interesting. A: So, B: You don't think about that as a career, a normal career, uh, when you're thinking of things that people might be doing. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: well, it's based here, A: uh, the international headquarters for Wycliff Bible Translators is right here in, in Dallas. B: So you're, you're with the home office now A: Yeah, A: right now I am. A: That's what brought me here, A: yeah. B: Well, the, uh, I think, uh, all in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas, uh, B: the weather you know, does change fast A: Yeah. B: and things do happen severely a few times a year, B: but there's an awful lot of good weather, too, in between. A: Yeah A: I agree, A: I agree. A: I, I thought the fall was really nice. B: Yeah, B: and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice, too. After the last freeze A: Uh-huh. B: and, and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time, uh, I like that. Particularly if I'm going to be outdoors and doing, uh, outdoor activity, hiking and things. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's nicer. A: Yeah, A: you probably do a lot of that with scout scouting. B: Yeah, B: I do quite a bit of that A: Uh-huh. B: Think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to the, east Texas, B: and it is a little more humid out there than it is here, B: so I guess we'll, A: Uh-huh. B: the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains. A: Uh-huh. B: There's not much between us and the North Pole A: Yeah. B: And then when you get one of those tornado type systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms A: Uh-huh. B: and then, A: Okay. A: Uh, do you live in a home? B: Yes. A: Uh-huh. B: We, we, it's a house we bought, uh, about two and a half years ago now. A: Oh, did you? B: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: First house. A: We've lived in ours for about six years. A: We had it built, actually. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, uh, it's our first home, too. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: So what do you think of, of owning a home as opposed to, to renting somebody else's? A: Um, well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in, B: Uh-huh. A: and, um, that was quite an experience A: I, I much prefer having my own home and, and, uh, just the space and, and more privacy. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Do you have, is it a fairly large house? A: Um, it's, uh, uh, it's like twenty-four fifty square feet. B: Oh, that's pretty good size. B: Yeah. A: It's a two story. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: How about yours? B: It's tiny. A: Is it small? B: It's not much bigger. B: Actually we had an apartment, two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is. B: So. A: Oh, really. B: Yeah, B: it's, uh, it's only like eleven hundred square feet. A: Oh, uh-huh. A: Do you, do you have children? B: Just one. A: Just one. B: Yeah. A: Oh. B: But, it, it, uh, all the rooms are small, I mean, B: but it ends up giving us three bedrooms, which we wanted. And, uh. Use an extra one for an office which is handy. A: Oh, uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: I'd rather have, have more rooms and less space in each one I guess. Rather have lots of rooms and lots of space, B: but, uh, that ends up costing me. A: Oh yeah, A: yeah. A: Well, like, um, how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood? B: Well, they're, it's pretty typical, I mean, it's a very, very middle class neighborhood. B: Uh, lots of, lots of young couples with, you know, oh, B: I'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood, that's their first homes A: Oh, uh-huh. B: and, uh, lots of kids and stuff, B: and, so it, it fits well, in the neighborhood. B: It's, it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood, B: but on the other hand, it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than I want. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: Is, is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood A: Uh. A: Yeah, A: it, it, it, it does, it, it seems about, oh, probably average. Um. B: or is it? B: Uh-huh. A: But our neighborhood has a, just a wide variety of, of, um, people, A: and, you know, there's older people here, and, and, um, people that are our, our age, A: we're in our thirties. B: Uh-huh. A: And, um, there's a lot of kids, a lot of kids. A: People across the street have eight. B: Uh-huh, B: wow, eight kids? A: Uh-huh. B: Oh, my gosh. A: Yeah, A: their home just burned down matter of fact, and, um, last summer, B: Ooh. A: and they're just rebuilding A: and, um, their house is going to be really big A: It's. B: I'm sure, with eight, B: gosh. A: Yeah, A: they're building a lot bigger. A: He's, uh, um, uh, oh, not an obstetrician, an, an orthopedic surgeon. B: Uh-huh. A: And, um, so since the house did burn, they're, they're going, A: it's quite different than it was before, A: and it's it's a lot bigger. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: And, um, but ours is about, A: it's, you know, it's a nice home, A: it's definitely not one of the, the smaller ones, A: and, um, it's not the biggest either. A: But. B: Yeah, B: new ones, I mean, they, they tend to, to be real tiny, but that uh, especially in newer neighborhoods, B: my, my brother just built a new house. B: He lives in Wichita, Kansas, B: and the, um, the neighborhood actually fought him on it, B: because he, he was, um, the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood. A: Oh. B: Now, that's because he was, he's doing a lot of it himself and, you know, for example, landscaping and, and lots of the other stuff, A: Yeah. B: and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots in the neighborhood, B: but but they were, they were pretty touchy on it. A: Yeah. A: You. B: He was a little surprised. A: You know, that's interesting A: you say that, because we do have, we have those architectural codes here B: Uh-huh. A: and when we, um, put out house in, um, they wanted us to have, A: there was one, A: we have part siding on, on the two story part and then on the back, B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: and, they, there was one side where our chimney was, A: and just the chimney was going to be brick, A: and they wanted us to have more brick, A: so we ended up having to go halfway up B: Uh-huh. A: which, it does look nicer, A: and, you know, we would have like to have had all brick, A: but, of course at that point we couldn't afford it, A: and, but, it's funny that you'd say that, because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all. B: Right. A: So it's kind of like, they were. B: Kind of depends on when they get in, you know. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: and, I, and so it was kind of like it's they, A: ours is the last street that they built on. A: So the houses actually on our street are a little bit, they're kind of gone a little bit nicer. B: Oh, they have, B: it's gotten, B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: I mean, just they, you know, B: Yeah, B: oh. A: it's like the second phase B: Uh-huh. A: and, and so they've kind of changed the, the codes a little bit, A: and so that's kind of why, I guess, they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any. B: Um. B: Well, see, my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that, because they, they moved into a neighborhood and bought a, a real nice stone house down in South Austin. A: Oh, uh-huh. B: And, uh, and, the, what the builder apparently plans to do, is they, they do phase one, B: and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled, uh, codes and, and, and stuff, B: and then they come back in, B: and, and then they sell, A: I, uh, spent four years as a university professor. B: Oh really? A: And, A: Yeah. B: I, I spent three years, B: I'm teaching in public schools and elementary school. A: Oh, do you really? B: Uh-huh. A: That's great. B: I taught in Utah, B: and, uh, Did you teach in California? A: No kidding. A: I did. B: Uh-huh. A: I did, uh, B: You sound pretty young for a university professor A: Well, I was pretty young. A: I was, uh, A: I had never intended to do it A: and I was, uh, uh, given the opportunity after I'd started a management consulting firm to teach in, in, uh, uh, one of the business schools in the California State University system. B: Uh-huh. A: At any rate, uh, the topic is fascinating because one of the things I've done for the past few years is, uh, research the problem from the point of view of, uh, uh, what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically. B: Uh-huh. A: You may be familiar with cooperative learning. A: Have you ever, B: Well you can, you can tell me a little bit more about it because I don't think we did that in Utah. A: Well, the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools. A: And, uh, what, what it involves, basically, is the use of peer groups A: and the, uh, teacher becomes a, uh, a sort of a consultant, resource person to the cooperative learning, uh, to the learning cooperatives, I guess they're called. B: Uh-huh. A: And there are, uh, some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people, uh, gain a competence with respect to the material. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, I think that the combination of, uh, technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn. A: Uh, I think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system, uh, that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster. A: Uh, school systems are, in too many states, dominated by administrators B: Uh-huh, B: yeah. A: and, uh, both teachers and parents, uh, complain about the, uh, uh, the cost and ineffectiveness that results. A: So my feeling is that, uh, the, the problem is, is, uh, significant. A: There are plenty of good people, uh, available to, uh, offer people educational experience, A: but that we just have to reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it A: and, uh, I think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research, uh, uh, of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance, particularly, uh, accelerate the, the pace of learning. B: Uh-huh. A: And, my feeling is that, uh, those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually. A: I don't know what form it will ultimately take. A: Uh, uh, but, I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for, uh, inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior, A: so it must be the way we're managing the process that, uh, B: Yeah, B: I see what year saying, B: yeah, B: I totally agree. A: I, I don't, I don't think it's, it's a matter of, of, uh, talented people to do it, both as, quote, unquote students and as teachers, A: but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past thirty years that weren't existent, uh, B: Oh, yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: you must see kids with real significant problems, uh, in some cases. A: Uh, course, I always see the, A: I don't know how hard, how hard is it, uh, in the public school system in Iowa City? A: Is it, is it, uh, deteriorated a lot. A: Do the people say, A: are they pretty happy with it, A: or, B: Well, I, I haven't taught in Iowa, B: but I've taught in Utah, B: and, uh, people there were saying that the way that the schools were going, a lot of people were going away and going to private schools, or else going to home, where they taught their kids at home. Or, you know, anything but the public schools and the ones that did have, you know, the kids, A: Right. A: Even in Utah. B: Yeah B: well, Well, uh, maybe it was the area I was in, A: Well, Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe. B: but a lot of schools had a lot of transient, uh, families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side B: and, A: Yeah, A: you, so, you saw a fair number of troubled kids. B: Yeah, B: I mean, like you said, how they were, the schools are doing more things for the kids, they thought, than they were thirty years ago. B: I mean, they were, the school I was teaching at, the, the year I left, they were considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: As well as hot lunch B: and, B: Well, as far as I'm concerned and it's probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching, uh, REASONABLE DOUBTS. Which had a, you know, capital case in it. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, I personally have, uh, B: my own feelings about, uh, capital punishment is I think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony. A: I do, too. B: Mandatory, I mean, summary execution, on the steps, that day. A: Uh-huh, A: well, I think, you know, I'm, I'm in that same, A: I think if it's, uh, if it's a if it's a convicted, uh, felon on parole uh, and he goes out and, and commits another crime or kills somebody, I, you know, I, I feel the same way, B: Uh-huh. A: I don't think, I think that person is, is beyond, uh, rehabilitation A: and, and he should be taken out B: Well, I, I also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation. A: Uh-huh. B: But, I do know that some people, almost all people usually die before that point. A: Uh-huh. B: They just get too old. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, as far as capital punishment, on, on it's own merits, I have the trouble with the way it's applied. B: I think it should be applied, on a little bit more fair manner. B: Uh, and I've, I've said this very often B: and I believe it to be the, a very true axiom, A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: Kill you. They will kill you. A: Yeah. B: And if you're black and you kill a black guy, you know, it's, you know, two hundred hours of community service. A: Yeah, A: you don't hear, you don't hear too much about, of those cases. B: Well, it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship, you know. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: We're the majority, B: so we can do whatever the hell we want to do. A: That's right. B: And you're the minority B: and you're stuck with it. A: Huh. B: But, uh, you know, we had this in the Vietnam war, you know, B: we had you know, B: population of blacks among military people in Vietnam was about eighty percent. A: Right. B: But the population of blacks in the military was about twenty-two percent. A: Huh. B: The handwriting's on the wall there, isn't it? A: Yep, A: it sure is. B: You know, but that's another issue altogether. A: Yeah A: it's, B: As far as capital punishment, I think that, uh, ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment. B: I think the guy should have ninety days B: and if he can't produce evidence not argument, but evidence, A: Uh-huh. A: See, the only thing I don't, you know, I don't understand, I guess I, I don't understand our judicial system, uh, as it is right now A: because I, you know, if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death, how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of execution? A: I mean, how, you know, is there, B: Well, B: that goes back to when, uh, America was a, a colony of England. A: Uh-huh. B: In England, you went to court, you were assumed guilty until proven innocent and once they found you guilty, you know, judge said, he's guilty, kill him. B: Well, there were some people that, uh, that had a problem with that. Because they found out later on that, jeez, you know, a guy will lie rather than get killed. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: And he'll say, you know, hey, that guy did it, you know, not me. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, or he'll have somebody lie for him. B: You know, people lie, B: it's a strange thing, A: Yeah. B: but they do that, B: and to prevent that kind of misuse of power, they wrote into the Constitution a protection against judicial mishap. A: Uh-huh. A: Huh. B: And the judicial mishap in this event would be, hey, you got the wrong guy. B: Look at that guy, uh, at E Systems. A: Yep. B: They were they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit. A: Yeah. B: He was too far away when it happened. B: He had witnesses that were, you know, they weren't dope dealers, they weren't drug fiends, they were employees of a, an establishment that had a very high level of security sense, too. And these were really responsible people. A: Huh. B: You know, and they convicted this guy because somebody says, well, he looks like the right guy. B: They all look the same to me, you know. A: Yeah. B: Big lips, flat nose, yep, that was him. A: Yep. A: What do you think about, uh, uh, convicted, uh, B: Well, this is an unusual topic. B: What do you think about it? A: Yeah, A: I, at first I, A: it took eight times to find you A: so I told my husband, uh, you know, A: what should I say A: and then he reminded me, A: but, uh, uh, in his family, uh, what they usually do, on his dad's side, his mom or, uh, the aunts will send out little postcards, like, two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the, the, where to meet and, you know, just, to bring anything, A: and so they just notify everyone by mail, A: and then they just meet at, like, a park or something to have like a, a short, uh, or a small, uh, dinner type thing. B: Well, that sounds great, Ellen. B: How far away do they come from? A: Uh, they come from, well, they all meet in Portland A: and they come as far as, oh, Seattle A: and, and sometimes we've gone A: and we were we were living in Utah at the time. B: Oh, okay. A: And, uh, the, his, his dad's family is all around the area A: and his mom's side of the family, they all, uh, have their family reunions in southern Utah A: and people would come from Seattle to there and, uh, let's see, Nevada and in that area, Washington and Nevada to southern Utah A: and they would, uh, assign a different person, each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody. B: Oh, okay, B: that makes sense. B: Nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once. A: Yeah, A: yeah A: and the people who are down there, like, they'll assign one person in the Utah area, one person in the Washington area A: and that person can call, you know, beforehand and just make sure everyone knows, too. B: Uh-huh. A: And then they just sort of do like a little program or, you know, something like that so that everyone's sort of involved. B: Yeah. B: That's interesting. B: You sound like you've had a lot of experience with this, then. A: Oh, well, that's my husband's side and my mom, my mom's, or my family, uh, A: we all live in southern California A: so we just have to either or, give a formal invite A: and we're all there A: so, B: Southern California's still pretty large. A: Yeah A: well, I mean L A, Orange County area. A: I mean everyone's, you know mostly not farther than an hour away. B: I see. B: Yeah, B: well, my experience, uh, has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side B: and, uh, they haven't had a reunion since then. B: They just show up at funerals and weddings. A: Oh B: It was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that, A: Wow. B: but, anyway, my mother's side we had our, our first real reunion that I've ever gone to last summer B: and they had people come in from out of town B: and they took some rooms down at a Holiday Inn B: and, uh, they had some activity, B: they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff B: and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree B: and, you know, a lot of that sort of thing. B: Since it was the first one that we'd had that, you could do that once. B: Now next time we have one, B: we'll have to think of something more creative to do. A: Well, you know, that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my, uh, husband's mother's side together is, uh, they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time A: and, uh, inevitably everyone is just very interested A: and, and they always have, you know, two or three new ones to add to the list, you know, someone's been born or someone passed away or, you know, something like that B: Oh. A: and so everyone has to update their little books or whatever. B: Well, have have you, do you have an interest in genealogy? A: Uh, I do, but not to, very much compared to my mother-in-law. B: Not a passion, huh. B: Uh, I suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy B: and I, I suspect we will do more of it. B: Uh, I found out some, about some of the relatives I didn't, you know, I, I didn't even know their names, some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles A: Um. B: and, uh, there's a lot of things there you have to stop, B: they're really kind of fascinating. B: I found out my grandmother was one of a twin. A: Oh. B: And we don't even know where the twin, B: we have virtually no, no background on, on her on the twin. A: Really? A: Is it your, your grandma's own sibling A: and she, B: My grandmother's, uh, sister who would be somewhere in, in West Virginia. B: I'm sure she's, you know, dead now, because my grandmother died in, about twenty years ago. A: Oh, I see. A: Oh so, B: I'm, I'm quite a bit, I'm probably a lot older than you are. Uh, A: Well, maybe, uh, they just moved away and then sort of lost contact. B: I don't know. A: Okay. A: Um, what type of magazines do you have? B: We take several at home. B: I, I take, um, SKIING MAGAZINE, B: and I take, uh, DISCOVER magazine, and also, uh, C D AND STEREO REVIEW and NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, I think and BOYS LIFE A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, . A: Oh, good. A: That's a good one, I like to get A: Um, so I take it that you like to ski. A: Do you, do you, um, receive a lot of information on skiing through the SKI MAGAZINE? B: I presume that I do. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because I do get things from ski associations and things, uh, at, during the year. A: Oh. A: Oh, uh, and do you receive discounts and things like that, A: do you think A: or, B: Uh, not so much that, I, uh, more likely to see those at a ski show or something, B: but um, made with I just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and, and new equipment that's come out and so forth. A: Oh. B: Some fashions are always in there too. A: Oh. A: Uh-huh. A: So would this vacation you're taking, A: did you receive information from your skiing magazine? B: Probably not. B: Uh, we already knew we wanted to take one, B: and we just started looking around. B: I may have referred to a couple of them, B: but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information, picked up a lot of brochures and just decided to go to Crested Butte. A: Oh. A: Oh. B: We haven't been there before. A: Um, that sounds nice. B: Kind of away from the crowd is why we chose that one. A: Uh-huh. B: It's supposedly low lift lines. A: Oh. B: But I haven't skied Utah yet, B: but I want to. A: Oh, well, you need to come out B: I'd like to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those. A: Uh-huh. B: I understand Deer Valley is nice, too. A: Deer Valley, A: uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: they are, A: it's wonderful snow B: Well, how about you, B: what, what magazines do you have at home? A: Uh, I am currently taking DECORATIVE WOODWORKING, and, uh, COUNTRY LIVING, A: and, let's see, we do have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, A: and then we have some church magazines, A: but I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING. A: I'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that, A: so the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a great, great help. B: Oh, okay. B: Does it have, uh, articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth? A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh, A: they do have, uh, mostly they have, uh, the ads on the equipment, A: but the whole magazine is just filled with, uh, pictures and projects that you can make yourself, A: and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project, and, and then how to paint it with the tole paintings, A: and so, it's really a fun one. A: I like that. B: Well, that's good. B: It's good to get use out of one. A: Uh-huh B: I'm not sure that, um, in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, B: I mean, I read it, B: but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time, A: Uh-huh. B: but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find you know, France or something or whatever it is he's looking for. A: Uh-huh A: Yeah. A: Yes. A: I've, I've noticed that, too, A: but they have been nice to have around. A: Every once in a while they come in handy B: I used to take SMITHSONIAN too, A: Oh. B: I liked that magazine A: Uh-huh. B: but it was, I was, just found myself not ever getting around to reading it. A: Oh. Uh. B: You get so many coming in, B: and by the time the next round comes in I'm still not through reading the first round. A: Oh, that. B: Oh, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house, too, I forgot, B: and that's mostly my son's, A: Oh. B: but but I do read it, too. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, well that sounds like. B: And he takes GAMES MAGAZINE GAME MAGAZINE, which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve, you know, crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that A: Uh-huh. A: Oh. A: Uh-huh. B: he likes to try that, B: so. He does, uh, does get to be a lot of paper though, B: after a while if you don't keep them weeded out, they almost take over. A: Uh-huh A: They do, they can do that. A: I found that they've been fun for my little girls, A: they're five and four years old, A: and they like to go through A: and, B: Oh, yeah, B: they're just kind of getting started now. A: Uh-huh. They like to cut the pictures out and paste them on, A: and so we've found good use for those. B: Mine is a senior in high school, B: so he's, we're kind of at the end of that trail. A: Oh. B: You're just sort of beginning to think about first grade. A: Oh. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: it's fun. A: Well, I do have a boy in junior high, too, A: so B: Oh, okay, B: so you got a little bit of a gap there between, A: so we're kind of running the gamut A: Yeah. A: Okay A: what, do you do artistic painting? B: Uh, I do tole painting. A: Oh, you do? B: Uh-huh, B: I really love the tole painting. B: Uh, I haven't done any of the oil or watercolor. B: I would like to learn that someday, B: but right now my passion is tole painting A: Do you do a lot of it? B: Uh-huh. A: I, I took one class about, I guess three or four years ago A: and I've done a little, uh, B: Oh. A: But it takes a lot of time B: It does, B: it is real time consuming B: and, A: do you sell your projects? B: Uh, mostly I have just given them away as gifts. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I've done, uh, perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and, oh, on and on, you know, just things like that, B: but uh, I would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job A: Uh-huh. A: Where do you work at? B: I just work at Stop and Shop out there in, in Ogden B: so, A: Now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique? B: No, B: I've wanted to do that, uh, but just haven't, just haven't mass produced enough to do that. A: Uh-huh. B: So, I have five children of my own, B: so it's A: That keeps you busy. B: they, they keep me busy B: and tole painting is just a, you know, something I do in my spare time B: so A: Uh-huh. A: Have you tried any of the, A: well, do you cut out your own projects? B: Yes, B: uh-huh, B: I have my own saws B: and so I really enjoy doing that. A: Huh. Do you, uh, ever spray your projects with the, I mean a base coat first A: or do you brush it on? B: I brush it on, B: yeah, B: I haven't tried a, a spray varnish. B: I use just a wood sealer. A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: I just bought a spray gun, one of those airless, uh, not airless, high volume, low pressure spray guns. B: Oh, uh-huh. A: And I do a lot of woodworking A: and that's what I bought it for. B: Do you? B: Oh. A: But I haven't used it yet. B: Oh, well that's that 'ud probably give you a smoother finish, wouldn't it? A: Yeah. B: Oh. A: Yeah. B: Now what type of woodworking do you do? A: Uh, fine furniture. B: Oh do you? A: Yeah. A: That's why I brought, bought the sprayer is to finish my projects. B: Oh. A: That's my worst, worst part of my woodworking. A: I get so sick of making B: Oh, but it's hard to finish it, huh. A: Yeah, A: but spraying does put on a nicer finish. B: Oh, well, that is interesting. B: So, what kind of equipment do you have? A: For woodworking? B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, let me see, A: table saw, scroll saw, band saw, lathe, routers, A: and about it. B: Boy, it sounds like you're really into it. B: That is nice. A: Yeah, A: it is. B: Yeah, B: I, I just have a scroll saw and a jig saw B: and I am really anxious to get a band saw and a router A: Yeah, A: the band saw is really nice. A: I have an Inca. A: I don't know if you've ever heard of those. B: Oh. A: But it's nice to have the right equipment. B: Yeah, B: that is, that makes it easier, doesn't it? A: Uh-huh. B: Well, have you sold any of your furniture B: or just, A: Uh A: not, A: mostly I do like you do, give it away as gifts. B: Uh-huh. A: But, Making my own furniture. B: Yeah. B: Oh, that's interesting. B: Do you, uh, did you take classes to learn how to do that? A: Uh, just in junior high B: Uh-huh. A: and then I just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment, kept up with that. B: Oh, so yours is mostly just a hobby, too, then. A: Yeah. B: Oh. A: Yeah. B: Well, that is interesting. B: Oh, I would, I really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to. B: I don't know if I necessarily want to do furniture, B: but mostly, uh, just do more, A: Like the shelves and, B: Uh-huh, B: the woodworking. A: For your tole painting. B: Uh, B: Yeah B: Yeah, B: so, it's fun A: Good. A: Well I guess I'll let you go now. B: Well, they come on, B: we're supposed to talk until they come on and tell us A: Oh, they do? A: Okay, A: so this is my first one. A: You're probably a veteran at this. B: Yeah. B: Well, it has, it has been really fun. B: I've enjoyed this. Uh, B: like I say, I've made a couple of calls to Texas, and just talked to all different kinds of people A: Uh-huh. B: so I think you'll enjoy doing it. A: Yeah. B: It's fun. A: Sounds fun. A: Where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here? B: Uh, you know, there's a shop in Roy that I really love. B: Uh, and it's there by the, Copper Mill restaurant, used to be the Hayloft. A: I am not A: well, we live in Roy A: , but, we A: is it on nineteen hundred? B: Uh-huh. B: Uh, let's see, B: I'm trying to think of the name. A: I know where fifty-six hundred south is. B: Uh, I don't right off. A: Is that Ben Franklin then ? B: Ben Franklin, B: okay. A: Okay, A: you want to start? B: Yeah, B: I might as well. B: Uh, one of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution, is the, uh, this, this, the ozone layer, uh, uh, issue. B: Uh, I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons, B: and that, uh, rather bothers me that, uh, I was in, in effect, uh, contributing to the delinquency of the, the environment, so to speak. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago. B: Right, B: right, B: and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven, twelve and thirteen, in, in, in that area was because they were inexpensive, B: uh, they could be made, uh, you know, inexpensive and lots of it, uh, B: and in that, and its properties were great, uh, with, uh, the machinery, didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to, uh, get your heating and cooling cycles to work. A: Um. B: So. A: Have they stopped that practice now? B: Well, course there's a, a tremendous number of refrigerators and excuse me, refrigerators and freezers, both commercial and residential, uh, utilizing freon twelve, B: and of course, the new cars, I guess starting with nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems. B: But, uh, there's, you know, the ton of after market machines, and et cetera, et cetera. A: Yeah. B: And that's got me very, you know, highly concerned that, uh, that's going to be quite a while before we can, uh, undo this. B: Now, that could spawn several good industries and help, pull us out of this recession, B: but you got to have people that can make, you know, earn a salary to pay for this conversion. B: So, so I see us in a kind, somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we, unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and, and come up with a way to, uh, have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting, uh, compound. A: Oh, yeah. B: Because as I say, there's a, there's a B: well, how many, uh, uh, families own a refrigerator, B: and then do, you know, that number, and then how many a, a freezer separate from and how many people, especially here in Texas, own cars and trucks with air conditioning. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah A: yeah. B: I mean, this is, there, there are people that, that make it, have a thriving business, uh, that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on, on automobiles and trucks, B: and, uh, the only reason I didn't, uh, get into that more, when I was, had my little business, was because, uh, most of your, uh, air conditioning in, in, on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree A: Uh-huh. B: and I mean, B: so, uh, that's why I stayed in, stayed more towards, uh, uh, B: and that's a polluting type deal too, is the excessive, um, you know, uh, petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth, and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with, with water and, uh, like knocking on a really make, uh, make a mess. A: Um, yeah, A: yeah, A: I hate to see a car going down the street, or even a truck or bus for that matter, that's putting out a lot of dark smoke, B: Uh-huh. A: and I know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars, B: Right. A: but that, that particular bothers me. B: Well, most, most, most of the time when you see bus, uh, you know, the busses with the diesel that's, uh, those are carbon particles, and carbon dioxide and water vapor, uh, A: Uh-huh. B: because when you, when diesel is burned it's it, B: you know diesel fuel is burned in a, in the diesel engine B: it's burned so completely, that you don't have any, uh, nitrous oxides, uh, or oxides of nitrogen, uh, to, uh, form because of, by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine, because diesel oil is, uh, is not very volatile. You know, where gasoline, if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone. A: Oh. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Diesel is going to be around, because it doesn't evaporate easily, B: and it's got, B: well, you know, its latent heat is high, B: but it's slow burning at, at, uh, normal pressures. B: That's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the, as the air is heated, you know, by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio A: Oh, I see. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and so if the car sucks in, uh, fifty degrees, A: Well, how do you feel about trial by jury? B: I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently. Uh, A: In what way? B: In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than, uh, by evidence that's presented. B: I have, uh, very little regard for the law presently practiced. A: Oh, do, do you feel they are swayed more toward, are you talking about with criminal or civil suits? B: I was thinking primarily criminal cases. A: So, do you think that, I mean the the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry. B: Yes. B: Uh-huh. B: That's a concern of mine. B: Uh, I would feel more comfortable in many cases I think with judges. Uh, you know, doing the sentencing. A: Uh-huh. A: The other thing, the only thing that really bothers me about that is I think you know, that a judge can be A: I, I like the idea of juries of your peers uh, in that you, you, you get more personally more than one person making the, making a decision. B: Uh-huh. A: And second of all, you get a wide variety of background A: so that, B: Yeah, B: my question I guess are they really your peers? A: Uh-huh. A: I'd agree with that. B: Uh Uh, too often I think they are not A: That's definitely a problem. A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, when you, when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if, if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have you know that is a matter of concern to me too. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I think that, uh, in such cases, uh, they are not really looking for unbiased people, but rather for biased. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, now I happen to know several judges B: and there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury I would feel a little bit uneasy about A: Uh-huh. B: but the other two I feel, uh, would give either you know, the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law. A: Uh-huh. B: And I guess that's what I am concerned with. A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: I, guess I, I definitely agree with you, A: but the A: well, what I don't like about, uh, sentence, the jury doing the sentencing in that I think it becomes a lot less, B: Uh-huh. A: the, the same crime gets unequal sentences. B: This is very true. A: I, uh, I think there is more of an ability of you know, you know for selecting a jury, two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea, uh, the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: but, I think, I think there would be a large variation in, in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board. B: Yeah B: and you do see such uneven sentencing you know, evidence of it in the newspapers and such, I mean where, uh, it would appear the crimes were very similar A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: but one individual got twenty-five years B: and the other one was sentenced to life. B: So, A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, A: Of course a lot of that's also the ability of, of the defendant to, uh, get a good lawyer. B: Isn't that the truth A: Uh-huh. B: There are times when is it, uh, B: oh goodness, my mind has gone blank it's, uh, Othello. B: You know where he says kill all the lawyers B: Every now and then one is tempted to see what, what. A: Yeah, A: I agree B: But, I, it's taken me a long time to understand that, uh, lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of, you know, as, as novices tend to think that, uh, attorneys care about justice. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh A: Oh, yeah, A: I, I agree with it A: yeah. A: They will admit to you that they don't have the benefit of being able to you know, of, of, letting, allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty B: Uh-huh. A: it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument. B: And they are very effective too. A: That the A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, even, B: I have been involved, uh, just slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty A: Uh-huh. B: but, uh, his attorneys gotten him off. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the city has dropped their charges against him because their, the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge. B: So I don't know A: Yeah. A: Uh, this is a little bit of the subject, A: but one, one thing that I really dislike, uh, also that's, that's new is the, uh, is that I have heard that there are federal sentences, A: I, A: you know, actually in this modern day and age, it seems like, uh, uh, we have more and more leisure time because, uh, we have so many convenience, appliances and whatnot. A: We don't even have to cook dinner anymore. B: Yes. B: Yeah, B: really. A: Uh, but I, uh, I've heard, I don't know this for a fact, but I've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together. A: That the kids maybe on the average get, uh, something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents. B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. A: I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the, the worst thing that's happening in the world, at least the modern world today, is television. B: Yeah. A: Not so much because, uh, it's bad per se, although there is some pretty crappy programming A: and I there's also some, uh, I think, uh, poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time. B: Right. A: It's so darned easy to turn the thing on. B: I know it. B: I've, I tell myself sometimes, just sit down after work, A: So I refuse to have one in the house. B: Oh really? A: Yeah. B: Well good for you. B: Good for you. B: A lot of people, I talk to a lot of people about that B: and I've thought about it myself B: and I though about it a lot A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, I still haven't done it yet. B: Well that's good. A: Well I'll tell you. A: Television sure makes child rearing easy on you. A: I mean the kids can be a real pest, uh, A: and turning the T V on is almost like magic, you know, A: it's like sticking, uh, an electrode into their pleasure center A: and you don't have to worry about them. B: That's true B: I've noticed that. A: But I don't think it's too good. B: I don't think so either. A: Uh, so, you know, I don't know, A: I take advantage, A: I don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids, A: but I take advantage of, um, dinner time. A: We always eat together A: and, you know, whenever you're with your kids, you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them. B: Do you keep your kids, uh, active in sports or anything B: or, A: Uh, I guess our big outlet is music. Uh B: Oh, okay. A: our thirteen year old son plays violin A: and our, nine year old daughter plays cello B: Okay. A: and, uh, when our son started playing violin, I took up violin A: and when our daughter started playing cello, I took up cello. A: So there's plenty of, plenty of interactive time in, uh, practicing. Although neither kid likes to practice. A: I guess that's not a big surprise. B: No. B: Not for kids A: But I I imagine with infants you are, most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them. Although, B: Yeah. B: Well I, I try and read to them B: and I take them to the park and stuff A: Oh, you know, reading is so good. and then you, you know, you go down a path B: Right. A: uh, and you don't know where it's going to end. In fact, you don't even know what you've eventually, you know, the totality of what you've revealed *sv This isn't, you know, most likely not to, going to be used against you, B: Yeah. B: Well, we, B: That's true. A: but it could A: and, And that seems to be something that should, should really be outlawed. Because it's subject to abuse B: Yeah, B: you just never know, I guess. B: That, B: yeah, B: I, I, A: and it, B: Asking for information is, is, B: I can't really see that, B: I think they ought to, if, if nothing else, they ought to spend money for a postage stamp B: and, you know, when it arrives at your house, oh, I, A: Okay, A: what kind of house do you live in? B: Well, uh, we live in a, a brick home in far north Dallas B: and it's, uh, four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back B: and, It's about thirty-five hundred square feet. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, it sounds like ours are pretty similar. A: I live in one, A: I don't have a swimming pool. A: And mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot. B: Yeah. A: But the four bedrooms A: and all the rest of it sounds just about about alike. A: I think it's pretty much typical for this area. B: It is. B: Have you been living there very long? A: I've been in the house A: I'm in here right now about twelve and a half years. B: So you've been there longer. B: We built this one about, uh, B: it's been let's see it's been six years six and a half years ago, A: Uh-huh. B: and we subcontracted it out ourselves. B: We bought the lot and, uh, had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications A: Oh, really? A: Uh-huh. B: and then we subbed it out, B: so, we've been here a little over six years now. And uh, have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, I bet you, A: Uh-huh. B: My husband got his big garage. B: He we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in A: Uh-huh. B: and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines B: and, so he has all the work space he needs. A: Well, that sounds interesting. A: I bet he's enjoyed having it that way B: He, A: because A: kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications. B: It is, B: and that's why we decided to build. B: We looked at things that were already, uh, built A: Uh-huh. B: and the garages were always, if the house was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have. A: Well, then, most of them don't have a three car garage. B: Uh-huh. A: They're kind of rare. B: So we put a three car garage in. A: Uh-huh. B: But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space. B: All of it was taken up with just car space. A: Uh-huh. B: And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on. A: Uh-huh. A: Well that, A: my, we've just got a two car garage, A: but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything. B: Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests. A: Now, mine does not work on cars, A: he just piddles on this and that. B: Oh, I see. A: But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his, his piddling things. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, that's nice that it's not in your house. A: It really is. B: Uh-huh. A: Because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own, A: and I, you know, I wouldn't mind having, A: and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff, B: Uh-huh. A: but I, someone, A: I don't know, A: it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something. B: Right. A: So I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would. B: Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come home. A: Uh-huh. B: And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come. B: His parents come B: and also the kids have friends who come and stay A: Uh-huh. B: and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, I still, A: all three of my daughters are married, A: but, I don't know, A: I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time. And some of them coming back home and things, you know. B: Right. B: Oh, I understand A: And we've got grandchildren now, A: so when they come, they have to have a place. B: Well, we, B: That's true B: and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room. A: That's right, A: you sure don't. A: At times I keep thinking, though, that might be kind of nice. B: Well, I I haven't reached that point yet. B: I've heard people say that. B: But, uh, my middle son is engaged, B: my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while. A: Uh-huh. B: He's out of college and has a good job, A: Uh-huh. B: so he could afford to get married but, is not engaged yet, A: Uh-huh. B: and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while, B: but she's still in college B: and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first. A: Uh-huh. B: That's what she plans to do. A: Well, I don't blame you for that. B: So, I hope so. A: Well, I have the three girls A: and then we ended up with four grandsons. B: Oh, ho-ho. A: And little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls. B: A whole new world. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, I enjoy them coming, but for short doses B: I can understand. A: It feels, A: after they've been here ten minutes, they have already explored the entire house, A: they know everything. B: Uh-huh. A: But, they're fun. B: So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute. A: Well, I just watch them. B: Yeah. A: I I never did put things up when my kids were little A: and I haven't with them. A: I try to teach them not to get into things. B: Well, that's the same thing that I did. B: I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren. A: I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes. A: At least my daughters have. A: They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up. A: So it's worked pretty well. A: There's, A: I don't really think anything's been broken. A: Every now and then we have to kind of go and say, now don't bother this you know. B: Um, uh-huh A: But, all in all, they mind pretty well. A: But, I guess most of the A: what kind of roof does your house have? A: Here I'm getting off the subject. B: Well, we have, A: All right. A: I've never done it before, A: so I guess that's all I have to do, right B: I guess so. A: I've been called several times, A: and I push in, pushed in my number, A: they kept saying you have the invalid code B: Oh, really. A: and then I found out that my new phone wasn't working right. B: Oh A: Oh, so this is the first time I've even done it. B: Yeah. A: I wonder how long it's going to be on for. B: I think five minutes is the max. A: Oh, no, A: I mean, this whole thing, like for two months or something, A: do you know? B: Oh, I don't know. A: Yeah, A: okay, A: well back to crime, A: I guess we're supposed to talk about that. A: They say what aspect are you worried about, A: well, I think at this point, I for one am worried about every aspect B: Right, B: especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex, B: you know, there's so much going on here. A: I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really a, something you got to protect yourself from. B: Well, that, and in the schools, too starting to put metal detectors in, A: Uh-huh, A: golly A: I know. B: and, A: Have they done that in Garland? B: No, B: I, B: not that I'm aware of. A: Now, um, B: I just heard, you know, last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting A: Right. B: so, um, A: Well, we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the, you know, on the school grounds after school. B: Is that right? A: And the one boy killed himself a few years ago, in the, in a grade school, A: so you know, these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood, doesn't seem like. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, B: yeah. A: So. Yeah, A: it's kind of scary to think, you send your child to school A: and you wonder if he's going to get shot. A: I mean, we didn't have to worry about that before. B: I know A: What next? B: I know, B: it's, it's, it's getting, B: it's been out of hand, I think, for a while, B: and it just continues to get worse. A: Right, A: and, you know, we can't really depend on the police to solve all this, A: they just can't do it. B: Yeah. A: I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent B: Right. A: and, uh, and how we going to bring that back together. B: Yeah, B: that's, B: I B: I agree, B: I think that's where it stems from, is that and, um, you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children A: Uh-huh. A: Right A: and, B: and that may impact it as well. A: I think so, A: and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know. B: Right, B: right. A: These, some of these young kids you read about, just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all B: Yeah A: I think I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals, you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood. B: they don't think twice about it. B: Yeah. B: Either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the, A: I think it was just rare, A: I really do. B: Uh-huh. A: My mother, well, she's like seventy-four now. A: She, when she was a young girl, she had a beautiful, beautiful cousin that lived in California, A: and she was dating this millionaire's son A: and he wanted to marry her, A: and she wouldn't marry him A: and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both, A: and, uh, B: You're kidding. A: No, A: I'm the one, B: Himself and her? A: Yeah, A: that must have been at least fifty years ago or more, A: but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks B: Oh, wow, B: I bet. A: but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas B: Oh, I know, A: it's just, you know, another killing. B: Well, they were, B: I was watching some show the other day, B: and they were talking about, uh, mass murderers A: Uh-huh. B: and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently, B: and they were saying, you know, that these guys want attention, and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper, it's on all the newspapers and T V and everything, A: Um. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Right, A: lots of their picture and life story and everything. B: Right, B: and then you get to their life story, B: Oh, they came from a broken family A: Uh-huh. B: oh this person had mental problems A: Right. B: oh duh, duh, duh you know, A: Right. A: I know, how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible, B: Yeah. A: So, uh, that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in Arlington, when was it, I think it was, oh, it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with. B: Is that right? A: Yeah, A: I think it was on a Hard Copy, A: she was a real attractive blond girl, in, in her freshman year of college B: Uh-huh. A: and some boy she tried to get rid of, he was like in his twenties, B: Uh, I remember seeing that, A: Remember that? B: I saw that on Hard Copy A: Right, A: right, A: that's, uh, B: Yes. A: My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School. B: Is that right? A: Yeah, A: can you believe it, A: that's just, uh, B: I'm trying to remember, B: he, um, had her in the car in front of a Taco or something A: Taco Bueno, A: right, A: uh-huh. B: and he just shot them himself and her. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: I remember seeing that. A: Yeah, uh, uh, A: isn't that weird? B: Yeah, B: there's just too many crazy people out there these days. A: I know, A: and, uh, the police are not going to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime. A: You know, he was just begging her on the phone, A: that's not doing anything. B: Yeah. A: And there are times I think, gee, I should give my kids A: not be a very good conversationalist on fishing. A: I don't do a lot of it. B: Well, I do love to fish. A: Well good, A: maybe I can learn something. B: Well, I don't know how much you can learn. B: I'm not so sure I'm good at it, B: but I do enjoy doing it. A: Do you? B: Yeah. A: Well, it is fun, what little I do. A: Of course, I don't, you know, A: I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing A: I told my husband last night when I had called and they had, told me that this was a topic, I said, well, I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm A: He said, I don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about B: Well, I hope it is, B: there's not a whole lot of different kinds. A: That's about the only kind I know how to do. B: I don't do a lot of deep sea fishing, B: I, because I get seasick, B: but we have a lot of lakes here in this area A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and I do a lot of fishing for, uh, bass. B: We have a lot of, uh, uh, couple of lakes in our area that are just filled with good sized bass. A: Uh-huh. B: And then when I get tired of them outwitting me, I fish for catfish A: Uh-huh. B: and we use worms and shiners, which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows, A: Uh-huh. B: and then I also use spinner baits and plastic worms. A: Uh-huh. B: It all depends on what I'm fishing for, and the time of day. A: Well, it sounds like you do quite a bit of it. B: I do. B: Uh, there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here, B: and it's very convenient on afternoons when I want to just get away and sit and think. A: Uh-huh. B: Fishing's a good way to do that, B: and I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing. A: Do you have a boat? B: No, B: I don't. B: I have a friend who has a little inflatable raft, B: and we use that sometimes. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: I wish I had a boat, B: but I don't. A: I think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas. A: The ones around here are so big, that you can fish off the dock B: Uh-huh. A: but unless you have a boat you can't really get into the, where they call the good fishing holes, you know. B: Right. B: That's the same way here, isn't it? A: Is it? B: You have to get back in the sticks in the, A: Uh-huh. A: My in-laws live on a lake, uh, a little bit east of Dallas, kind of in the Piney Woods, A: and the lake is beautiful, A: and I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish, A: but actually catching fish to eat per se, you don't really do much of that right there. A: I catch a lot of little old, uh, I think they call them perch B: Right. A: and then the, the, uh, turtles try to eat up all my bait B: Oh. A: So it's, it's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit B: We don't have, We don't have a big problem with turtles, A: but it's kind of fun. B: but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes. A: Um I would be afraid of that. B: And I, Well, I can't think of a time that I've been fishing that I haven't run into one or two of them. A: Do they ever get on your hook? B: No, B: we, uh, B: occasionally I'll catch an eel on a, on a hook, but never the snakes. A: Uh-huh. B: They just kind of, A: Are they poisonous snakes? B: Uh, we have a lot of cotton mouth, B: so yes B: they are, definitely A: Uh-huh. B: and they live in little shallow, little coves that I like to fish in, B: so I seem them swimming by every once in a while. A: Yeah, A: I think I'd be a little bit afraid of those. B: Yeah, B: they can, they're, they're certainly ugly. A: Uh-huh. A: We, uh, saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws' place last year. A: It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know. A: Great big snake, A: and it, of course, it scared the women to death, you know, A: but the men come out and said oh, well, that's only a, a king snake, it won't really hurt you, you know. A: But it looked so bad B: Yeah. A: and it was so big, that it might not would have hurt us, A: but we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there, you know B: Definitely. A: But they're scary looking. B: Do you have bass? A: Yes, uh, A: I think that, uh, probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else. B: Right. B: Well, that's pretty much the same way here. A: Uh-huh. B: I, A: Now, they have a lot of bass tournaments. B: Well, we have those. B: I don't A: Uh-huh. B: I inevitably, if I enter one of those, I never catch a thing. A: Oh, no. B: I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it. A: Uh-huh. A: Well that's kind of, A: we've never entered a tournament or anything. A: We're not that big into fishing, A: but I see a lot of people, A: you know, early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out, A: and they'll say, Well, there's a big bass tournament this weekend, A: and all those people are here for the tournament, you know. B: Oh, yes. A: So I think there's a lot of people that have, you know, really, I guess that you'd call it really sport fishing, A: they're really into it to try to win. B: Yeah, B: oh, definitely. A: My. B: Certainly here they are. A: But it is, it's very, a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around. A: The peace and calmness is really relaxing. B: Yeah, B: it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish. A: Uh-huh. B: That's what I do a lot. A: I've never tried taking a book with me. A: I'll have to try that one of these days. B: Hi, B: this is Donna Donahue. A: Hi, Donna. B: Hi. A: Ready to get started? B: Uh, yeah, B: I think so. A: Okay. A: Sort of an interesting topic since I just got back from lunch here B: Okay. B: Well, what did you have for lunch? A: Oh, it was, uh, it was, A: I'm an officer in the Air Force, Yeah. B: Oh. B: Oh. B: Well, that's interesting. B: Okay. B: So our topic is, is food today, B: is that, A: Yeah. B: Okay. A: If you're having a dinner party, what, what would you serve? B: Okay, uh, B: do you want me to go first? A: Sure. B: Okay. B: If I was having a dinner party I would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips around and peanuts. B: And then I would have, um, let's see. I usually have like a little theme when I have a dinner party Um, I would have maybe, um, say if it was like Greek night or something *sd um, maybe, um, on the barbecue we'd put, uh, cubes of lamb or I guess lamb used for Greek. And, um, like a shish kabob, and, um, mushrooms and tomatoes and onions A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and then we'd have, um, like a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar salad. A: Uh-huh. B: And, um, let's see what else. B: Um, maybe some rolls and, um, I guess some, uh, some rice or something like that. B: How does that sound? A: Jeez, A: well, well, when is the party here? B: Yeah. B: Um, yeah, B: that would take some planning B: but, A: I don't know A: being a, being the bachelor here that I am, I, I don't think I'd, I'd be A: I mean it, it's not a question of capability here to do something like that. A: It's just there's, there's no motivation. B: That's right. A: You know, I want to, I want to throw some charcoal on the grill and, and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that A: but, um, B: Well, that sounds good too. B: I have, um, I have three kids A: Uh-huh. B: so, um, when we have friends over I have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs B: and, um, usually we just have very plain kind of, you know, interesting, not very interesting meals. Pizza and that all A: Uh-huh. B: so once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun, B: but it's not a, not a regular thing. Now are we supposed to talk for about five minutes, A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: it? A: Yeah, A: that's what they, they are shooting for here. B: Okay. B: Um, let's see now B: okay, B: so you would have a barbecue A: Well, I live on a, I live on a lake here, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, so it, A: and then during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors, B: Oh, sure. A: like that's a little more a casual thing. A: But in mine the wintertime it's not bad too because then I've got a, a fireplace and a nice, nice house and all that A: so we, really good place to do entertaining like that. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, that sounds wonderful. A: I just haven't, uh, really tried a whole lot A: but, uh I don't know, B: Uh-huh. A: let's see. A: I have had, well, one time I did have a dinner party. A: I served a, uh, uh, A: I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits, and kind of southern, uh, southern food even though I'm up here in New York, B: Uh-huh. A: so B: Oh, you are in New York right now? A: Yeah. B: Oh. B: I'm, I'm in Texas. B: I didn't know this was all, from all over the whole country. A: Oh, yeah. A: Yeah, B: Oh, I see. A: it is. A: It's, B: And I'm originally from Long Island. A: Oh, no kidding? B: Yes, B: and now where are you in New York? A: Upstate. B: Oh, upstate. A: Rome. A: In, uh, Griffins Air Force Base. B: Oh, okay. B: Oh, okay. B: Is that where you, you are originally from around there? B: Oh, okay. A: and, uh, been all over the place. B: Oh, wow. B: That's interesting. B: Okay, B: let's see. B: Um, well, I like to have, um, sometimes when I have a dinner party I'll have, um, everybody bring something, A: Yeah. B: and that's real interesting because then you get different, um, different kinds of foods and new recipes B: and, um, uh, sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like, A: Right. B: and get the recipe from them or whatever. B: And we are just getting interested in, in Mexican food B: because here in Texas they have lots of, really good Mexican restaurants A: Uh-huh. B: and, um, we're, we're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could, A: Sure. B: do you know what a fajita is? A: Yeah. A: Yeah, B: Yeah. A: I've been down to Texas a few times, and, uh, had, uh, the pleasure of their good Mexican, cuisine down there. B: Okay. B: Yes. B: They have some delicious, delicious things, B: and I, um, B: since I always make chicken burritos and just take chicken breasts A: Uh-huh. B: and you boil them, maybe like four chicken breasts, B: and you boil them until they are cooked. Maybe like thirty minutes A: Uh-huh. B: and then you debone them and, and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled B: and you take, um, little bit, maybe two tablespoons of butter and a in a big frying pan. And chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt, A: Uh, I guess I've always kind of liked golf. A: I, I worked on a golf course at, at one time A: and that's how I picked up golf. A: And, uh, I don't know A: it's just a, kind of a challenging game. B: It sure is. B: I play at least three times a week. A: Uh-huh. B: I'm on it, A: I haven't gotten the chance lately though to play. A: I'm trying to get back into it. A: Uh, so, uh, I got to start all over again. A: It's not like riding a bicycle. A: You do tend to, forget. B: No. B: Well, I'm one of those rare left-handed golfers. A: Oh. A: Yeah. B: And I do enjoy playing. A: What is your handicap? B: Right now it's three. A: Okay. A: Uh, I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago. A: It's probably up there to twenty now if I to start again. B: Well, if you play with some consistency though, you can get it right back down. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: I have got to try and get out there. A: I, I know with our, our long winters I, I enjoy watching it. A: I don't know if it's just because I like the game or I just like to, to see the warm weather. B: Uh, well, we can usually play here year around. B: Sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play. A: Uh-huh. B: But there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play, B: and I'm pretty much addicted to golf, B: so. I get out there one way or the other. A: Yeah, A: that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter A: you almost have to relearn every spring to, to get back out. B: It's a good game though. B: It's very challenging B: and the reason I like it so much is because I'm essentially playing against myself. A: Yeah. B: That's the way I look at it. B: I, I play in, in a lot of groups B: and but I, they keep score and, between themselves B: but I really don't care. B: Um, I go out B: and each shot I say, well, this is what I'm going to try to do A: Uh-huh. B: and then I see how close I can come to that. A: Right. A: Yeah, A: you always work on trying to improve each day A: and, B: Yeah, B: and inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another. B: Either I'm not driving very well B: or I'm not hitting long irons very well B: or I'm not putting well B: or, but sometimes it all comes together. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I know what you mean. A: I, when I used to golf out there I'd putt well but I, I wouldn't, uh, chip well. A: One of the two, uh, A: or something would go wrong A: but I always managed to, to get near par anyway. B: Well, we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst. A: Oh. B: And I went to that. B: Craig Statler won in a playoff. A: Uh-huh. B: But we, uh, B: this is a big golf area. A: Yeah. B: We have a lot of, uh, B: I'd say we probably have within fifteen miles, twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course, Pine Hurst B: and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year. A: Uh-huh. A: Do you have, uh, long waits, uh, to get on the course? B: Yes, B: we do as a matter of fact. B: It, it, uh, it's only been that way in the last five years. A: Yeah. B: But now you, uh, B: most of the courses have a, uh, two day advance tee time you have to call, A: Yeah. A: Okay. A: I just moved into this small community A: so I'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here. A: I'm hoping that won't be, A: I, was from the, uh, twin cities area. B: That's some cold golf too, isn't it? A: Yeah A: Are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather? B: We have cold. A: Yeah. B: Usually January and the first two weeks of February. A: Well, I wish that's all we had. B: But, uh, last week we were in the seventies. B: Something is coming through now B: so it's like in the low forties right now. A: Oh. B: But, uh, it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties. B: We have very windy winters and very cold. A: Yeah B: But we don't get any snow anymore. B: I don't, I don't know what changed that pattern. B: We used to get four or five inches a year. B: Now we get nothing. B: It's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall. A: I see. A: Well, at least it, that doesn't, uh, get in the way of golfing A: so that B: No, Get out my orange golf ball and go out. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: that's what they do here sometimes. A: You hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there A: but, if you got, B: Okay. A: So what do you, uh, think is the, uh, the worst culprit for air pollution? B: Well, I think it's, it's probably a combination of things. B: Um, factories that, that burn coal as a, an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants, you know, B: and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain, B: and I think that's, that's probably hurting us a little bit. B: It's hurting, you know, it's hurting Germany, for example, too, and some other parts of Europe where they, where they have high industry. B: So we're not the lone ranger here. A: Yeah. A: I, uh, I, A: it's hard to put the finger on, uh, what's worse, you know, the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion, um, with, uh, your hydrocarbons, uh causing the damage in which, B: Yeah. B: Hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit, B: but I know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot. A: Well, I notice on one of these, uh, home shopping networks they were selling these, uh, halogen, uh, fire extinguishers B: Yeah. A: and the halogen is, uh, an ozone depleter, A: and it got hydrocarbons in there. A: It's a very clean, uh, fire extinguisher, A: but it's, you know, really bad on the environment. B: Yeah. B: Huh. B: Yeah, B: I guess I missed that one. B: Uh. A: Yeah. B: Automobiles of course are contributing, too, B: and, you know, how, how we are with our love affair with the auto A: Yeah. B: kind of hard to do anything about that, I guess. A: I know, A: uh, in the Twin Cities area, A: I just moved out of there and was kind of happy I timed it just right, A: but they had a new policy where in order to get your, uh, your license, uh, your car license, uh, renewed, you had to meet the pollution standards B: Yeah. A: and, uh. B: We have that here, too, B: but it's part of the inspection sticker, you know, B: they put a probe in your exhaust pipe B: and, and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out, B: and so that's, you know, that's the way they're dealing with it here. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, uh, A: yeah A: I guess that was just mainly in the cities there, A: and as far as where I live, I don't have to do that, A: but I have an old car which I doubt would, uh, would, uh, pass the inspection, a seventy-six, B: Yeah. A: and, uh, you know, there's no way I would put in a lot of money to, to repair it to meet standards. B: Yeah. B: It'd probably be difficult anyway. A: Yeah. A: So, although I do what I can to, to cut down pollution, A: but, uh. B: I was just reading an article in, uh, MOTHER EARTH NEWS, MOTHER EARTH NEWS magazine A: Yeah. B: and, uh, they've got a new, uh, B: you know a lot of places are burning wood A: Yeah. B: a lot, a lot of people are burning wood, B: those of us who have, B: I've got a place in the country, you know A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, they've had catalytic you know, catalytic converters on those, on, B: uh, I think they're required in California and Oregon and, and Washington, B: but they've had up those for quite a while, B: and somebody's come up with a new one that, uh, sort of, B: it's a, it's a catalytic converter, B: it's, it's a plate that fits in, you know, into the smoke pipe A: Yeah. B: and, uh, apparently it sort of feeds itself. B: The more smoke is produced, you know, B: after you get to like five hundred degrees, the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is. B: And it sounds real neat. B: I haven't seen them priced anywhere yet, B: but that, that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on you know, old, old, uh, older stoves that don't have any kind of E P A requirements on them. A: Yeah. B: That might help a little bit, especially in some places. B: We're really lucky here. B: We have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out. A: Yeah. B: Now sometimes we get a kind of a, B: especially in, in, uh, autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us, B: but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well. A: Yeah. B: Probably blowing up there to you guys A: Yeah, A: well, well around here I, we get, uh, A: well it depends, you know, A: either in the, in the winter time it, it blows it your way, A: and in the summer time we probably get yours. B: Yeah. B: It comes back. B: Yeah. B: I really think, uh, you know, we're doing some, some important things. B: Education, raising consciousness awareness, B: uh, I know school kids, B: I work for the school district here, B: and, uh, you know, this is one of the big things with kids. B: Kids are writing letters to the newspapers about, you know, telling adults to clean up their act A: Yeah. B: and, it's uh, you know, B: I hope we're not too late with it. B: We're, we're, uh, we're having all kinds of recycling. A: Yeah, A: well, it, uh, that's a big thing, too. A: I know it has nothing to do with air pollution, A: but I kind of look at the way people treat our, A: Surprised they get anybody this time of day A: but, I've been trying all different times, B: Uh-huh. A: but I don't get anybody at five thirty, don't get anybody at nine at night A: so thought, I'll try , B: Oh, well, I'm at, work B: and I just happened to walk back into my office. A: Oh B: I've been gone for a little while A: Oh. A: Well, I go to school A: so I'm home certain days, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, I really haven't been making any phone calls, have you? A: Got, B: I don't, I haven't ever made any. B: I just receive them A: Oh A: Have you, have you received many? B: I haven't here lately. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: It's, it's, uh, A: well, the first time we were on this it came just about every day. B: Yeah. A: I never had to make one. A: They just always came B: Yeah. B: Exactly. A: People must be tired of it or something. A: well anyway I guess we're supposed to discuss this, uh, subject, A: what do you think? B: Well, I never gave it any thought myself B: I was hoping you could tell me what you thought. A: Oh. A: Well, I don't have any objection to people doing that. A: I think it might be good for them. B: Uh-huh. A: But as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent. B: Exactly. A: I'm just concerned about their safety B: Uh-huh. A: because if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: And if they were sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait worried, you know. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: That, that would be my main objection. I don't think, B: Uh-huh. B: I don't know B: I think maybe it's, it should stay on a voluntary basis A: it will probably never happen A: but, B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I, I think it would be good for, uh, everyone to do something like that B: but I, I guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon you. A: Yeah, A: well it, it probably won't. B: Uh-huh. A: I don't, I don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway. A: We can't, uh seem to pay for all the little things we have going now B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: That's another consideration B: Exactly A: But, uh, I don't know A: some kids are so spoiled nowadays A: it might be a real eye opener, you know B: Really A: I mean, sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here A: and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes A: and then they think, A: they're just kind of shocked at that side of town, you know B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl B: I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while A: Oh A: Well that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it? B: Wouldn't it though? A: I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country. B: Uh-huh, B: it is. A: I know. A: Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world, and helping some countries I never even heard of. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: I know it. A: It seems to me we are, A: it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country. Right on our borders. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: But, what do I know, right? A: I'm just sitting at home and, and, uh, doing laundry today and certainly not up, A: nobody has called me from Washington A: Oh, but, uh, anyway, how did you get on this program? B: I work at T I. A: Oh, you do work at T I? A: Oh, you're in Lewisville. B: Uh-huh. A: Oh, yeah. A: I just went by that place. A: We were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost A: and, uh we went by. A: That's the first time I'd seen it. A: It looked really nice. B: Yeah. A: A lot of trees there. A: It looked like a pretty little, a sight. B: Hang on a minute. A: Sure. B: to someone in the No, B: I don't think so, B: Yeah, B: Patty might. B: I'm back. A: Oh, sure. B: But how did you get on it? A: Well, my husband works at T I over on Central. B: Oh. A: Uh, why we're living in Arlington I'm not so sure A: but, he works over there A: and A: we did it last time. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, so I'm, just my daughter and I are registered this time. A: I don't know, A: they didn't even ask him back B: Really? A: That was weird, wasn't it? B: Huh. A: But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time. B: Uh-huh. B: I don't get too many. A: And I can never find anybody. B: Huh. A: So, um, B: The first time I used to get calls from far away too. A: Right. B: Like Maryland, and New Jersey, A: Uh-huh. B: and but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from. A: Yeah, A: I've had the same experiences, B: Uh-huh. A: all right around here. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I don't know, uh, A: I wonder if they really, A: I don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents. A: There's just, there's so many with this one town you know. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: even in some families some people talk a little bit different. B: Oh, yeah. B: Yeah. A: My husband is from New Jersey A: and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me A: and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way, A: and that's one family, right? A: Of course, I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny A: but B: Oh, I agree. A: You know, how that goes B: Oh, shoot. A: Oh, God. A: Well, I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet. A: Sometimes she says at night. Or, or or overloads B: Yeah. A: so please end your conversation. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: Right. A: Well, do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject? B: No, B: I sure don't A: You don't have any kids you want to send over here? B: No, B: no kids A: Well, is B: Oh, shoot. A: Well, uh, I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto. A: Well, one of them is real idealistic, A: she might B: My sister is, B: I'd be more suited to that than her B: she's just bugs, B: Okay, B: you ready? A: Yeah, A: is that it? B: That's it. A: Okay, A: Uh, well, we, I guess we have to talk about magazines A: and, uh, what, what, B: What, what kind do you subscribe to or do you? A: Well, I subscribe to well, I did subscribe to PEOPLE for a long time. A: I do, you know, A: I enjoy PEOPLE. A: And now I'm, uh, I, uh, subscribe to, uh, LADIES HOME JOURNAL. B: I, uh, take a computer magazine. And, uh, also, uh, BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS. A: Uh-huh. A: Okay, A: are you interested in, in computers? B: And my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside. And the cardboard pages A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah, A: well, that, that would be one of my peeves. A: My pet peeves with magazines, the woman's magazines especially, A: I mean, it's, it's really geared to, A: all they have, A: you have too many recipes first of all. A: I just don't, you know, A: that's what I don't like about LADIES HOME JOURNAL magazines. A: Too many recipes, too many, uh, can this marriage with saved nonsense. A: I, you know, I like to read articles about things that matter. A: Well, of course, PEOPLE magazine is not, you know, one of your, uh, your more intellectual magazines, A: but it's nice, light reading A: You know, if I want something intellectual, I usually read a book. B: Well, that's true. B: I, uh, I like it when they have short stories. B: Like REDBOOK used to always have a good short story in it. A: Well, that's true, A: yeah, A: they did. B: And I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while B: so I guess A: Yeah. B: I, I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore A: Well, is REDBOOK still in existence? A: I don't know if they're, if they're around anymore. B: Yeah B: I think it is. B: it's an institution, B: surely it would have to be. A: Yeah. B: But, A: Well, I'll tell you, the only reason I bought the, uh, I subscribe to the JOURNAL is because of, A: which I think it was either, A: yeah, A: it was Publisher's Clearinghouse B: Right A: They told me, you know, if I didn't subscribe they were going to take me off their, their winning, you know, their list A: So, B: Mine, too B: This was it, my last chance A: Yeah, A: my last, right, my last chance to win ten million dollars, A: so I figured, hey, look For twelve dollars, you know, B: Well, I, I, I went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that uh, to, uh, ENTERTAINMENT. A: That's it. A: Oh, yeah, A: oh, uh-huh. B: And I was real disappointed with it. A: Yeah. B: I, I don't know, B: it just, B: not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into. A: Right. B: It's little short articles more than anything else. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's one thing I don't like about PEOPLE. B: Uh, it 's just, you know, doesn't seem to have enough story to it. A: Well, I don't know, A: I just think, uh, you know, it's, It's light reading. B: If you've only got a short time to read A: You know, you don't have, well, you don't have to concentrate, you know you know. B: No, B: that's true A: It's entertaining, you know, A: and, uh, that's, A: I just, I enjoy it, A: I, you know, I, uh A: Well, that ENTERTAINMENT is, is very, A: wasn't that similar, or isn't it similar to, to the TV GUIDE? B: Uh, no, B: not really. B: I mean, not the one I take now. B: It's a, it's a magazine B: and it goes into all the movies, previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes. A: Oh, uh-huh. A: Oh, I see. B: And, uh, I'm a real movie buff, B: so that's why I thought I might be interested in it, B: but it just hasn't been what I thought it would be. A: Oh, uh-huh. B: And, uh, my mother has subscribed to, is the reason I get, uh, the HOME JOURNAL and the, uh, computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me. A: Oh. B: Otherwise, if, if I really want to take the time to read a magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf, I'll pick it up then. Rather than having them delivered and think, oh, I really need to read this A: Right, A: right. A: Well, I'll tell you, since I've been getting the JOURNAL, like maybe, maybe I'll read two, maybe three, A: if I read three articles in, in, you know, one of the JOURNALs, I figure, you know, I did really well. B: Yeah, A: Because there's just nothing in there that interests me. A: I don't, you know, I don't, I'm not into, you know, recipes A: and B: Well, I, I do like recipes and crafts. A: See, now, and I'm not into crafts, A: so, you know, that, that eliminates, like three quarters of the magazine You know. B: That's true. A: Well, I just got the new issue, A: they have Bette Midler on the cover, A: so that should be one article that I'll read anyway B: Do you, uh, A: So, how is the weather out there? B: Uh, it's really cold B: and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold B: and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had. A: Oh, really? B: You have, breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff. B: How about you guys? A: Um. Uh, it's just, it's a, it's about same. A: The usual, I think. B: Oh. A: So, nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff A: It's good. B: Yeah, B: well the weather, let's see, well, the snow here is different from Utah's, B: because I have lived in Utah for like ten years. A: Oh, really? A: What part? B: And, uh, B: Provo. B: I was going to B Y U. A: Oh, really? A: Okay. B: Yeah. B: And, uh, the snow is like, really cold. B: I mean, it's, like, really humid B: so it seems wetter or something like that. B: It's, A: It's more humid in Utah than there? B: Uh-huh. A: Or there? B: It's more humid in Iowa than Utah. A: Okay. A: Right. B: Yeah. A: Okay. B: And it seems like when the winds blow, it's really, it goes right through you. B: It's really different from Utah's weather. B: I thought Utah was cold, B: but I think Iowa is a lot colder A: Yeah, A: see, that's how it is in Texas, too A: because when it's cold, it's really cold. A: So, B: Yeah, B: I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind A: What's that? B: I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind. A: Right. A: Yeah. A: So the humidity is I think what does it B: Yeah, B: I think that's true. A: Because I, I noticed when I got here, too, A: because like I'd, A: when it would snow in Texas uh, I would just, I mean we'd be really cold B: Uh-huh. A: and we'd have to get really warm, A: and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing A: and you don't you don't feel super cold. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: that's true. A: It was weird. B: Yeah. A: But, so how long ago did you graduate? A: Or did you, A: or, B: Uh, I graduated in nineteen eighty-seven. A: Oh, really? B: Yeah, B: my husband got his doctorate at B Y U, B: so that's, B: and so he just graduated this past year. A: Oh. A: So you just barely moved away? B: Uh-huh B: Yeah, Well, we really miss Utah A: Do you like it out there? B: We miss the mountains. A: You do? A: Yeah. B: Because it's, like, really flat here B: Well, not flat, but hilly. B: But no big mountains or anything. A: Uh-huh. A: So you just moved away a year ago? B: Uh, in August. A: Wow, really recent. B: Yeah. B: But, uh, see, see what else can I say about the weather. B: Uh, well, today was warmer B: It was like forty-five A: Oh, warm B: So, what's the temperature up today over there? A: Oh, man, A: it's got to be like, it's probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe. B: Oh, really? A: Maybe not that warm. A: Probably about, uh, A: yeah. A: It's not, it's not that cold, really. B: And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah, I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill. A: Yeah. B: But they talk about wind chill here all the time. A: Yeah, A: that's a big deal in Texas, too. B: They said it could be, like, six degrees out and, like, negative forty-one wind chill. A: Um. B: So, that's what we're not used to A: Yeah, A: that's true. A: That makes a big difference. Huh. B: So, oh, I, A: So, did you used to ski when you were out here? B: What's that? A: Did you used to ski when you were in Utah? B: Oh, I've only, I've only skied in Utah once. A: Oh, really? B: I only skied once my whole life B: But, do you do a lot of skiing there? A: Uh, not tons, A: but I like to when I get a chance. B: Uh-huh. A: I've only been once so far, but had the opportunity a couple times since then. A: Just saving my money for Christmas things and that. B: Yeah. B: So is this your first year in Utah? A: Uh, no, A: this is actually my third year. B: And you're going to school there? A: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: Yep. B: At U of U, B: or, A: No, A: at B Y U. B: Oh, really? A: Yeah. B: Oh. A: So, but, I'll be here a long time at this rate. B: What's your major? A: Uh, it was nursing, A: but I'm in the process of changing it right now. B: Uh-huh, B: oh. A: Because it's really, really competitive at B Y U. B: Yeah. A: You have to have like a three seven to get in A: so, It's really, B: That's true. A: I'm going to look into some other fields. A: I'd like, A: all the science classes and that, I'm just not really enjoying too much A: so I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school B: Uh-huh. A: so, B: Yeah, B: that's, that's a good idea. A: Did you graduate in a certain field A: or, B: Uh, education. B: I got a double major. A: In, B: Uh, elementary and special ed. A: Really? B: Uh-huh. A: That what my sister did. B: Oh, really? A: Yeah, A: you might know her. A: Here name is Lori, Bird. A: Maybe not A: I think she graduated around then, too, though, eighty-seven probably, A: but, she got her B: Yeah, B: well, I can't, B: there are so many girls in all my classes, B: I can't remember how many people. A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: Because they, what people face with that choice. B: One thing I really hate, is they don't explain to the jurors, in a, in a trial, in a capital murder trial, or in cases of rape, or in different things that are so horrible, what it means when they sentence them to, you know, B: they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's, you know, that it's going to, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: that should be life, B: but, instead, in, in B: given the choice of either sentencing to death, or sentencing to life, they'll give them ninety years in prison or something, and then turn around in thirty years, that, you know, B: and less they're out. A: Uh-huh. B: Even if, if they're even in that long. B: Or they appeal, B: and then they get an appeal that says it was, you know, an unjust amount of time, an extraordinary long length, or something. A: Time, uh-huh. A: Yes. A: I was, I would just be, A: I would love to see them just really get real strict on parole you know. B: Yeah. B: I'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent, B: I think people know that nobody, that it doesn't, you know, B: it's not a deterrent right now, because it's not really effective. A: Uh-huh. B: There's should be, you know, this, for this crime, this is the penalty. B: You killed, someone you know, in cold blood or whatever. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: You get, it back, A: yeah. B: This is what's going to happen. A: Yeah. B: And, I mean, it sounds horrible. B: It, B: I hear myself saying this, B: and, but, I, don't know what else to do with some of these people, that are, A: Yeah. A: But it's, A: I, I know. B: because they let them back out again, B: and they do the same thing over, and over, again, A: Same thing, A: Yes. B: then they put them back in jail, B: and they get out, B: and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed A: Yes. A: Uh-huh. B: and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system. A: Uh-huh. B: And it's like I said at our expense. A: Uh, a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it, because it hasn't happened to them, which it hasn't to me either, you know? B: Yes. A: Thank goodness. A: But still, it could. B: I know, B: I, you read about it in the paper, every day, somebody who's done this, or that, something really horrible A: Yes. A: Uh-huh. B: and they just get away with it, B: and nothing happens. A: And as far as the other states, I honestly don't know what their capital punishment is. A: You know, I, I, haven't kept up, you know, anything, like that. B: Yeah. B: I think I think Texas is Texas, the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty, B: and I think, I know California had it for a long time, B: and then they, uh, took it off the books, B: they repealed it A: Uh-huh. B: and people like Charles Manson, and, and some of these other people, who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty, were sentenced to life in prison, and are now, now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty, for whatever various crimes. B: The people who were there originally, when they, when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty, are still in there for, are in prison, in quote, for life, and, and are now coming up for parole, B: some of them, like Manson who's come up you know A: Uh. A: Uh-huh. B: it's been denied fortunately B: but, A: Yes. A: But still, it came up though, didn't it, B: Yeah. A: I mean, you know B: Well, the jury that sentenced him, sentenced him to death A: Uh-huh. B: and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal, the state of California revoked the law in the early seventies, B: and then they reinstated it later, B: but the penalty didn't go back. You know? A: Uh-huh. B: It seems like a lot of times the law is, is totally on the criminal side, and, and isn't protecting the rest of the people. A: Yes. A: The victim is really, seems like left out in the cold, more or less, doesn't it, B: Uh-huh. A: in a lot of, well, especially in things, you pick up the paper, A: and you read, you know, you think, oh my goodness B: Yeah. B: And the, the laws are all, the rules. B: Some of the things that would make sense to, to tell the jury, that this, this guy has a, a prior criminal history, you know, where he's raped ten women A: Uh-huh. B: and then he gets up for this one trial, B: and they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again A: Uh-huh. B: and so they say, well, this is, you know, B: I, I don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever, B: but they give him a lighter sentence, thinking he's not a habitual criminal. A: Or, you know, plead insanity. B: Yeah, B: yeah. Well, B: To some extent if they would do something with some of those people. B: But that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too. A: Oh yes, B: They plead insanity A: uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and then three years later they're cured, and let loose on society again. A: Yes. A: I, A: it just, just doesn't make sense, B: I mean, it's a it's a scary world out there anymore, where your afraid to go out, A: I, B: I know, in, in the Dallas metroplex area, I don't go out hardly if I don't have to at night by myself A: Uh-huh. B: and I, I certainly, I, I grew up in a smaller town in Texas, B: and it wasn't that way when I was younger. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, like I, said, I live in a small place. You know. B: We could go around, B: and, boy and, A: But, uh, even the small towns now though, has really changed from when I was a kid, A: but now I'm raising children. A: It it really is. B: Yes. B: Ever, B: you can't even, B: when I was a kid, I would run between my neighbors, three and four blocks sometimes, and, as long as my mom had a general idea where I was and I was back on the time, A: Uh-huh. B: and now I don't let my kids out of the front yard, that I can't see them. A: See them. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: It really is. A: Well, we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty, soon, B: Uh-huh. A: but I've enjoyed talking to you. B: Well, good talking to you too. B: Bye, A: Bye B: bye. A: okay. A: Bye-bye A: Okay, um, A: now the term personal computer, uh, A: I don't happen to have one at home. Um, A: but I do have a personal computer on my desk here. B: A type of work station? A: Yeah, A: uh, yeah, A: just kind of, it's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to, to, uh, shall we say bypass the formal procurement process. A: And, uh, it, it works just fine. A: It says it's a monochrome monitor, Panasonic printer, uh, no big deal, A: it, it does the things I need for it to do. B: Is it a two eighty-six or three eighty-six base machine? A: No, A: it's not even that. B: It's eighty eighty-eight? A: Uh, I think that's about where it is. B: Okay. B: Uh what type of, uh, utilizations do you make of it? B: Word processing obviously. A: Uh, yeah, A: I do that, A: I, I do, uh, some Lotus on it. Uh, do some, uh, Samna, some, uh, P F M, uh, nothing extremely complex. B: Okay. B: Uh, I use them both here at work and at home. A: Uh-huh. B: And I have I B M clones in both cases. A: Yep. B: Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty-six base machine. A: Oh, yeah. A: I bet that's a pretty nice setup. B: Yes, B: it is. B: Uh, unfortunately I need all of it. A: Yep. B: Uh, for example, I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size. A: Wow. B: And that, I know that, uh, brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it B: and he had a two eighty-six machine, A: Yep. B: and it brought it to its knees. Just in the ability to handle. A: Wow. B: And then I have, uh, a three eighty-six F X a sixteen bit machine, at home. A: Uh-huh. B: And I'm really pleased with it. A: Uh-huh. B: It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and, uh, databases, database searches. A: Sure. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, what I've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them. B: Have you, A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: To try to make them more effective and useful. A: Right. B: Have you been, uh, struggling along those lines? A: Well, um, I seem to always be in the, the next to the last generation of word processing software. A: When everyone was in Samna I was still in P F M, A: and now that I finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect. A: So, I can never quite stay current with that. B: Well, I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it. B: It's, uh, B: I used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it. B: It was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it. A: Uh-huh. B: The, B: at least the version I had tended to keep copies of that. Of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of, all of a sudden you got a disc full error. Not a fun thing to try to recover from. A: Oh. A: Huh. A: I can I can believe that. B: Very frustrating. B: Uh, but again I've been dealing with large files both data and, and otherwise. B: Uh, that was a engineering spec on B two. B: You come here with the B level of specs? A: No, A: not really. A: I'm not that up be on that sort of thing. B: Well, it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. Uh, to one level down from assistant description. A: Oh, okay. A: Oh, okay. A: Okay. A: Oh, well, it sounds like you're pretty much into computers. B: Well, I sure need them. B: Uh, there's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to, to try to do my job without them. A: I can believe that. A: Well, it's, it's been interesting. B: Yes, uh, B: maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things. B: I think that's when you, you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have. B: When you start seeing what all they can do for you. A: Yeah, A: of course, needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing. B: Well, I understand that you know. B: if, needs and wants were the same I'd have a four eighty-six machine at home A: I A: is, is that the newest thing now, the four eighty-six? B: Right. A: That, that must be a fairly recent release. B: Uh, that's, B: came out around the first of the year. A: Okay, A: okay. A: Because I, I had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes, A: but I didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet. B: It does a few more things, uh, than had been available before. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: But I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. Uh, you know, B: once you get passed thirty-three megahertz, all help is, kind of lost in the, in the translation. Because you no longer can think that fast anyway. A: Sure. A: Yeah. B: Well, okay. B: I enjoyed our discussion. A: I did too, A: and you have a good day. B: You do the same. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye. A: All Right. A: Ladies, first. B: Oh, no. B: Well, I don't find a lot of time to watch T V. B: And a lot of time, I find it during the day when, when I'm rocking my little girl to sleep, B: so I watch a lot of reruns, old shows, Like DICK VAN DYKE, all those old crazy shows. B: Yeah B: I really enjoy watching ANDY GRIFFITH. A: Well, A: so your a homemaker? B: Yeah. A: I guess, that's, the right term nowadays. B: Yeah. B: I guess so. B: Yeah, B: I am. B: I stay home with two kids. A: Yeah. A: My wife, A: we have a new one in the house A: and she stays home, too, also. B: Huh-uh. A: Um, I guess, I have a wide variety. A: I like watching the T V for things that are interesting, A: not so much the things that aren't, A: for example, like the COSBY SHOW to me is just kind of like a waste of my time, and DIFFERENT STROKES. B: Huh-uh. A: But I like SIXTY MINUTES, PRIME TIME LIVE. B: Huh-uh. A: Of course, I have to watch cartoons on Saturday morning, but not the NINJA TURTLES. A: I like the old-timey ones, TOM AND JERRY. B: You sound like my husband. A: There you go. B: He likes TOM AND JERRY and, uh, BUGS BUNNY AND ALL HIS FRIENDS. And all those guys. A: Right. A: JOHNNIE QUEST. the good ones. B: Yeah. Yeah. A: Um, now if I'm ever home during the, during the day on a vacation day, I have to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, because I usually, because he's just, he's one of my idles. A: And then, uh, but I don't know, A: it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic, you know, magnified and animated, that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings. B: Huh-uh. B: Huh-uh. A: And so, uh, now I do, with the COSBY SHOW, A: I have seen it a couple of times A: and, I do, A: I like the show. A: I just don't watch it. Because of the timing, B: Yeah. A: but, uh, some of the crap that's on T V nowadays, it's about . B: Yeah. A: I do watch the special shows that they come out with, the NOVA stuff. And, and, the nature shows. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: But, I think there's enough out there to pick from. A: I'm not, A: we don't have cable to the point of, of the H B O or any of that stuff. B: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: But, uh, B: Well, I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children. Because, *two utts with two kids A: Huh-uh. B: and, you know, I don't want them watching something that I don't think they should watch B: or, I used to be really hooked on ALL MY CHILDREN, A: Sure. A: Oh, me. B: And I watched that for like, oh, ten or fifteen straight years, A: Oh, no. B: and then I had, well, you know, I'd eat B: like at work, we'd have a T V or whatever. B: And then, um, as my kids got older and started, you know, recognizing what was going on, I thought, this isn't really very good B: So I gave it up. A: Fifteen years. B: Yeah. A: Bet they hated that. B: I watched, I had watched it since it started. B: So, A: Oh, goodness. B: Uh, now I, I don't know who the characters are, B: and, um, I'll turn it on every once in awhile B: and I don't recognize anybody, B: so I guess that's a good sign A: Yeah. A: Really. A: I used to watch, uh, A: I can recall, A: this might age me, date me here, uh, A: I can remember staying home, when I was five and six, and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT. B: Huh-uh. B: Oh, yeah. B: Well, see, you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the SECRET STORM, and the EDGE OF NIGHT. A: SECRET STORM. A: Well, I think they were back to back, and black and white. B: Huh-uh. B: Huh-uh. A: I was just a youngster A: and I was like, oh, my gosh. B: Yeah, B: we used to, B: my mother watched all that stuff, too. B: And AS THE WORLD TURNS. I think AS THE WORLD TURNS may, still on or not. A: Still be on. B: It was not too long ago. A: Yeah. A: Now they got a lot of other crap involved. A: And so, B: Yeah. A: You're right. A: I think some of the tones of the, the daily prime time is questionable, B: Yeah. A: And that could be, uh, A: I have to agree with you. B: Yeah. A: You know keep them on the channel eleven, channel twenty one. The nature stuff, you know B: Right. B: Yeah. B: We do, B: and it's real interesting, too, the difference in my kids, B: like um, my oldest loved SESAME STREET, And those kind of shows. A: Huh-uh. B: My younger one doesn't. B: She's more into WALT DISNEY kind, you know, B: we watch a lot of movies that we've got on V C, on tapes, and stuff. A: Huh-uh. B: She's more into the animated stuff, where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing B: so, But, um, we do a lot of kid watching. A: Huh-uh. A: Well, sounds like you got your hands full there, A: and I do appreciate speaking with you. B: Sure. B: It was fun. A: Have you gotten your catalog yet? B: No, B: I don't think so. A: Yeah. A: I just spoke with Jim. A: I just got my in the mail *sp? mine A: and it inspired me to make more phone calls B: Oh, well, see I don't really. B: I've had a few people call me, B: but, I've never made one. A: Oh, really. B: Yeah. B: I need to get brave A: Yeah. A: Give them your pen number. *sp: pin B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: That's what I need to do. A: Have a good day. B: Thanks. A: Bye-bye. A: Bye-bye. B: All right. A: All right. A: What are some of your favorite foods? B: Mine, well, A: I imagine in Argentina you've got some great foods. B: Yeah, B: well, we got, um, a lot of, uh, European dishes. A: Uh-huh. B: We got, we got what some people call the best beef in the world. A: Yes. B: So it's, uh, Bishu B: like every Sunday you go out, B: and you buy all these parts of the cow, B: and then you just cook them over a grill. B: That's, B: like, in our house, it's already built in. B: There's this whole special place in the back B: so you can make a barbecue. A: I've had, I've had that meal in New York, uh, where they bring you a plank, sort of, with all this wonderful beef parts of beef, cooked and barbecued B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: and it's marvelous . B: And then. A: I have to find a place around here that has that. B: Well, they have one in, uh, they have an Argentinean place down in Georgetown. B: So. A: Okay, A: I'll keep that in mind, yeah. B: Um. A: You serve that yourself, or the, for a family? B: Excuse me? A: You ever serve that yourself when you have company? B: Oh, no, B: well, see, the problem is, I'm only twenty-two A: Uh-huh. B: but like, like when I'm down at home A: Yeah. B: and like somebody says okay, when are, when are we having this, you know, B: and I'll cook it. A: Oh. B: You know, like you have to prepare the fire, and then put the sausages on, B: and then, you know, you put all these different meats which take different times. A: Do you buy them, um, separately at, you know, an American grocery store now, A: or do you have to, A: you don't, you don't go buy it from a wholesaler. B: No, B: but what happens is in Argentina they have like all these little places like the fruit stand, and, you know, the dairy, and products and whatever, A: Little butcher shops, yeah. *two utts B: and so. A: Yeah, A: I've lived in Mexico, A: so I know. B: And so they got, they got the meat place. A: Yeah. B: And so you just go there B: and, you can't find chicken there, B: you got to go to another place to find the chicken. A: Yeah, A: you have to, you have poultry place. A: What do you, what other, what dishes do you serve with it? B: Well, basically, it's, what we call it impenadas which is, which is, like, A: Yeah. A: The turnover, A: the stuffed turnover. B: Right, B: meat turnovers. A: Oh, I love those, A: uh-huh. B: And, then we also put sausages on a bun, B: and then that's, that's to start out with. A: Yeah. B: And then what you have is also like, you know, like three different kinds of salad. A: Uh-huh. B: And uh, that's about it. A: Do you remember when you were in Washington, Sam the Argentine baker? B: Uh, no. A: It used to be in Georgetown, years ago. A: He moved, A: I guess he, he retired and went back to Argentina, A: I guess, in the early seventies. B: Oh, okay. A: Yeah, A: so that that's before your time. B: Yeah. A: Your parents might remember if they were here then. B: No, B: we were only there for two years. A: Okay. A: I mean, he was wonderful. A: We used to get the most marvelous impenadas and other Argentine things. B: Yeah. B: And, uh, what I, what I also eat now, since I graduate, B: I have an Italian roommate, B: and, A: Yeah, A: I'm Italian. B: Are you? A: Uh-huh. B: And since being Argentinean we also have a lot of pasta. A: Yeah, well, B: And, you know, A: Because there're many Italians in Argentina. B: Yeah, B: and my mom, you know, like makes like what we call niokes and *sp:gnocchis all this stuff, that it's just, you know, everything like lasagna and everything. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. A: My grandparents, my grandfather came to the United States through Argentina. B: Oh, okay. A: This was around the turn of the century. Actually, actually a little bit later, like nineteen thirteen, nineteen twelve, nineteen thirteen. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: At one point, one third of the population of Argentina was Italian. Like pure Italians. A: well, I'll tell you, A: it's interesting, because when we cook here, A: I'm of Italian descent. A: My husband is Chinese. B: Okay. A: So we, and we both love Continental cooking, French cooking. B: Okay. A: So we cook, uh, A: our meals are, well, A: we don't, we don't usually mix. A: I mean, that sometimes B: Right. Yeah. *slash error should be 'b' A: well, if we're entertaining we'll do a Chinese recipe A: and, um, there are really easy recipe A: that is, you know, with Chinese you always have several dishes A: And nowadays with microwaves, A: you can steam many of the things in a microwave. B: Yeah. A: I don't know if you have one. B: Yeah. A: And if you like Chinese food, you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some, uh, waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done, B: Okay. B: Okay. B: Okay. A: and it's a wonderful um, flavorful piece of fish. B: Is it? A: Yeah. B: Because I was at, you know, B: it's like, when you, when you go buy fish, you know A: Uh-huh. B: well like I buy like the fish B: so you can do it in the microwave the breaded fish, A: Uh-huh. B: and yeah, B: I've seen, you know, the filet. A: Yeah, A: buy a fresh filet of fish, a nice one at the fish the fish counter. B: What kind of fish? A: Um, any white fish. A: Sole is good, uh, um, flounder B: Okay. A: sole or flounder is real good. And even grouper. B: So we put soy sauce and sesame. A: Little bit of soy sauce and sesame seed oil. B: Okay. A: And, not too much soy sauce. A: Uh, some chopped up um, you know, slivers of scallions. And slivers of ginger. And then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just, just two, say two minutes, check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes. B: Okay. A: And if the fish flakes, it's done. A: Don't overcook it though. B: Okay, B: because I got, I got, um, one of those little, uh, microwaves, B: the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water. A: Well, you see, just check it, you know, during, B: Yeah. A: And another quick dish if you like, um, do you know what hoi sin sauce is, *two utts? A: it's that sweet Chinese sauce? B: No, B: I don't. A: Well if you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin, H O I S I N. B: Wait, wait, wait, H, *three? A: H O I , B: H O I, A: S I N, or S E N B: S I N, A: either way they'll spell it. Hoi Sin sauce. A: It's a very sweet dark, sort of a purplish plum sauce, purplish brown. A: And if you take, uh, little pieces of pork and you fry them, like little cubes of pork. And you fry them with garlic and a little bit of, couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry, just a little sherry to thin it, and stir that in. You can even put a spoon of ketchup in, B: Okay. B: Okay. B: Okay. A: and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce, that you can serve over rice. B: Uh, how much, uh, how much pork do you buy for two people. A: Um, well, A: For two people, um, if it's American style, I buy a half a pound. If, you know, we, if you're just serving that, A: but if you're serving another dish with it, say the rice dish um, well, with guys pretty healthy appetites, I'd probably go a third of a pound B: Right. A: and then, you know, you could, B: Yeah, B: I could probably go half a pound A: And you can always, you can always heat it up again, and save, you know. B: So, it's just, it's just, since I'm from Argentina, I just love meat. A: Yeah. B: And we, A: You can also do the same thing using, um, if you have ground beef. B: Okay. A: Just stir fry the ground beef. A: Drain off the oil. A: Use the same hoi sin sauce and some of the frozen mixed vegetables. B: Okay. A: Just stir that in A: and you've got a very colorful side, another dish. B: And how much does it cost? A: Um, the hoi sin sauce? B: Yeah. A: Oh, a dollar twenty-nine a can. B: Oh, okay. A: A can would serve you for, for, you know, for quite a few, um, meals, you know. B: Yeah. B: Okay, B: I thought it was maybe like, you know, like five fifty or something. A: Oh, no, A: no, A: no, A: no, A: no A: it's not expensive at all. A: It's one of the Chinese cooking basics. B: Oh, okay. A: Yeah, A: well listen, it was good talking with you. B: Same here. A: Hope you enjoy your recipe. B: All right. B: Thank you. A: Okay. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye-bye. A: It's, it's hard topic because A: is, is, is it doing a good job or a bad job A: and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like I do. B: Yeah, B: and are you talking about public schools being lower level, high school level or state school. A: Well, public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to, uh, uh, high school. B: Okay, B: but you're excluding high-level education. A: Yes, A: well, yeah A: I am. Oh, B: Okay. A: actually I think that, I, higher level education, A: I don't think there's so much of a problem there. A: It's pretty much funded well. A: There are small colleges that I'm sure are struggling A: but, uh, it's the job that the, the high school and the grade schools are doing that I see, in a area like ours, A: our school, A: even a bad school is a good school up here, where, if I lived in New York City or Washington, D C, uh, I would seriously consider moving if I had a child. A: I wouldn't let them go to a public school system there. A: But, of course, people are trapped economically A: and they can't do that. B: Yeah. B: I know down here the schools are, you know, B: I don't know, B: they rate, B: I moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio B: and the schools down here rate, you know, bottom ten percent across the country B: and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why. B: Because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed, half the time the teachers don't know what's going on. A: Well, that's really too bad because it, it's giving some people unfair advantage. A: I mean we, our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida B: Right. A: what we learned. B: Well, that was my experience going through junior high up there B: when I came down south for high school I was just repeating what I'd already done. Because we were so far advanced. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, you know, I'd been in a parochial school before junior high B: and, you know, even the public schools are behind the parochial schools. A: Yeah. B: So, you know, I, I like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education, you know, B: you, you pick a career path B: or you get counseling earlier B: and then you, you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over. A: Like they have that down there that, B: Well, they talk about it B: and there are a few in some of the more, like in B: I live in a big Metroplex B: and some of the, the better parts of the Metroplex, the, the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools. B: But, uh, you know, A: Yeah, A: it's like if, if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that, A: there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school. B: Right. B: Or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art. B: You know, there's no point in, you know, B: I'm an engineering student B: and if I have to go take art classes, you know, I'm not going to use them. B: And through high school I could have gone so much further if I'd gone to a school that was directed. A: Yeah, A: that's true. A: I was fortunate. A: I'm a, I'm a technician A: and we had a vocational, uh, electronics in our high school. B: Right, B: in high school. A: So when I went to my first year of tech school, I had a very easy time because our high school had a, a good program. B: Right. B: I think the schools today, you know, the public schools are just, they're just overrun, you know, B: they don't know what to do, B: there's too many kids and not enough teachers B: and too many of the kids don't care. A: Yeah, A: I find that that the, that in the, in the cities, it's more like the kids go there so socialize not really to learn B: And, B: Right. A: and the parents send them there because they're supposed to, A: and plus it gets them out of their hair. A: And I also find that, that you can send a kid to school, A: but if don't work with them as a parent, I think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage. B: Yeah, B: and, you know, there's some kids that, you know, want to go learn, B: but most of them just want to go play. A: Yeah, A: well I could, I could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if, they're, you know, come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about trying to work *sp:their A: and, or maybe they're unemployed A: and they're mad at the world, A: I can see where that wouldn't be very good for a, a kid, you know, A: he's coming up, will you help me with my homework A: and they're, no, get away from me, A: I've had a terrible day. A: So, it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from. B: Yeah, B: that's true. B: I'm wondering with the boom down here. B: It's, well, not at the moment, B: but a lot of the industry's moving southward. A: Yeah, A: are they going to move to, uh Mexico? B: So, B: Uh, I don't know about that, B: but a lot of the industry up in, uh, you know, the northern states is moving south A: Uh-huh. B: and I'm wondering if that's going to have any effect, you know, on what you see now. B: We're, we're, we're behind down here. A: On the, B: I say we because I live here. B: If B: that might not turn around in the next, you know, fifteen, twenty years. A: Yeah, A: maybe the, maybe they'll bring their good schools with them. You know, A: if the industry comes hopefully they'll promote good schools. B: Yeah. A: Because I know the town that I come from the, the, uh, the large I B M plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one A: and plus for, for the type of student that's going to that school, it's going to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists. B: Right. A: They're, they're, you're most likely to do better in school. A: They're going to help you. B: You hope. A: Yeah, A: you hope A: Well, I think, A: I, I don't know. A: I just think it, it's, it's a duty of the parent to do that. A: I mean, jeez, my parents always helped me A: and, I don't know, A: it's just like you say, A: it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in. A: I can see some lady, A: she's twenty-one years old A: and she's got four kids. A: A kid in, A: her first grader, A: I don't see where she's going to have much time for them. A: So, I don't know. A: It's just like, B: I guess you just have to wonder, B: is it up to the, B: is it, you know, B: who, who's supposed to make the change, the, the state, the the federal government, you know, B: where's the money supposed to come from. B: Is it, you know A: I don't know. A: Actually, I think it's, I think it should be a civic level, the city level and a, a system level really to find out, and to see what they need and not overinflate it, B: what, what do you advocate, more taxes or better management of what they got? A: like, if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back, and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go now, hey, wait a minute, B: Yeah A: we're in a recession here. A: We, uh, our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many, many years just because people are, are in the recession A: and they're, A: even though we've, uh, enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years, A: now we got eight percent, uh, unemployment when it used to be four or five. A: People are going, whoa. B: Yeah. A: So, B: Starts hitting closer to home. A: Yeah, A: but I always, see it's all, it's all money. A: This, A: like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime. A: It, it's, it's all money based. A: And what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level A: and, and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school. A: Who knows, A: maybe we do, we need some more Catholic schools, A: support the church instead A: They seem to have done a, the good job in the past. A: In, uh, some places, uh, you couldn't go to a public school. A: It was miles down the road A: and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school A: so, B: Yeah, B: they're a lot more strict. A: Yeah A: I don't, B: You, uh, have to learn, B: you aren't given the chance to, you know, screw off all the time. A: Yeah, A: I don't know if I would do that to my child, though. A: But, so, pretty much, though, A: see, I don't have any good ideas or, or anything that would contribute. A: See, this isn't a subject that I think a lot about because I'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont, it seems to do a really good job. B: Well, I know I'm in the, you know, B: the only reason I asked about secondary schools or, you know, advanced education is because down here, you know, going to the University of Texas, the education I'm getting I think is kind of shoddy for a public school. A: Is it? B: I, I don't think I'm getting what I should, B: but, you know, in Texas, it's next to free because they pay so much of it. B: It's state supported. A: Well that, B: But at the same time it's really not, it's not like going to M I T. B: My engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of M I T. B: And that's, it's really too bad A: Well, B: but that's, B: I don't know, B: I think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built. B: You get people out of high schools and junior colleges that don't have the background for an M I T kind of curriculum. B: So, A: So you have to go to a lesser engineering school. A: We have a very good public school up here A: and a degree out there means a lot. A: It's a very good school. A: It's, it's University of Vermont. A: Uh, we also have some two year college. A: Well, there's a four year colleges. A: They all have a pretty good reputation. A: But, like you say, you, A: There we go. B: Yeah. B: Well, uh, I think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than I would expect this time of year. A: I think that's true. A: The, uh, the Bermuda grass is greening up in March, A: and sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of April. A: So. So I think we're a little ahead of schedule on that. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I was out in my yard yesterday afternoon, B: and I noticed all that grass coming up, B: and I thought, ooh, B: we've got to start this mowing bit soon A: That's true. A: It's been a, a fun break, A: but the break is over. B: Yeah. B: Well, um, oh, I guess another thing I've noticed, too, here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days, it's been awfully gray, you know, just, A: Yeah, A: now, the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny. B: Yeah. B: But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it's gray A: Well, yeah, A: but I'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend. B: Oh, I go for that, B: yeah. A: Yeah. B: In fact, I'm a little worried about this one coming up here. B: We have a long weekend B: and, it sounds like it's going to be a little bit on the cool side. A: Yeah. A: I haven't heard whether it's going to rain or not. B: I think there's an eighty percent chance this evening, B: but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow B: and then the rest will be without rain. A: Well, that's good. B: But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties, and the lows in the forties. B: That's getting back to a little bit chillier. A: Yeah, A: that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year. A: I think, A: I haven't seen the the weather on the news in the evening lately, A: but I think the average high would be, should be about seventy. B: Yeah. B: I'm not certain either, B: but you're probably right. A: Yeah. B: Well, I like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, uh, maybe seventy-five to eighty, somewhere in there. B: I don't like it when it's too cool or too warm. B: I'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature. A: Yeah, A: that's true. A: Um, one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high. B: Um. A: And what that tells me, is that the summer weather is very predictable, that it doesn't vary very much. B: Yeah. B: You're probably right. A: I mean, any other time of year, that's not the case, because it could be very warm or very cold. B: Yes, B: as a matter of fact, I heard the weather the other day on T V B: and I think it was one day this week a year ago A: Uh-huh. B: they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather. You know A: Right. B: it wasn't just a super bad storm, B: but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the, the late spring time. A: Right. A: Yeah. A: One of the weirdest things I saw, I think it was around this time last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm. B: Oh, wow. A: I, you know, I was going into the grocery store, A: and a, a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead, A: and it was six degrees out. B: Um. A: And I thought, Well gee, I've, I've never known it to lightening at that temperature. B: Yeah, B: that, that is pretty unusual. B: And you really take notice of it, too. A: That's right. A: It, uh, it probably was a lot warmer up high. A: Sometimes they get those inversions, like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing. A: The air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees. B: Um. A: The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away. B: Wow. B: I don't, don't like that super cold stuff. A: Nope. B: I just don't move very well when it's that cold. A: Yep, A: I, I'm really enjoying this now. A: Well, this has been interesting. B: Yeah, well. A: Not too challenging to the brain. B: Not, not a real in depth topic, but enjoyed talking to you. A: Nope. A: All right, Ellen, A: well you have a good day. B: Okay. A: Bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Are you a player? B: Uh, I, I think I am. B: It's, it's been a while now A: Has it? B: Yeah, B: I've, uh, oh, B: just recently I got married B: and we bought a house. B: We're about fifty yards from the golf course A: Oh. B: but unfortunately the house is taking up my time. A: Yeah. B: So it's been, uh, it's been almost a year, I guess, since I've actually, uh, swung a club for a purpose. A: Yeah, A: I I haven't played in about two years, A: and then I went out two weeks ago with the guys here. A: I work at T I. B: Yeah. A: And I played in a tournament out there, A: and I shot a net fifty-nine. A: They were kind of, little upset. A: I guess I laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: I have a hard time inventing shots, you know. A: Let's go around this tree, and you know, try a slice through a hook here, B: Right. A: and I can't do that A: so. B: Right. A: I finally got out, A: and I've been watching quite a few videos. A: I had not been able to play A: so I took out a few videos and watched them for a while, A: and I, I hope I'm on the right track. B: Yeah. A: Shot a career low eighty-nine, so, and my handicap is twenty nine. B: That's, that's great. A: I like that. B: Yeah. B: Now it's, uh, like I say, it's been a while for me, too. B: I, uh, I've got my wife motivated about it, um A: Really. B: and, uh, I think that's probably going to be one of the next investments, is get her, get her a set of clubs B: and, uh, we'll get out of the driving range and, and get some interest built up B: and hopefully we can, uh, we can start in. A: Yeah, A: I've tried to get my wife, A: I bought her a set of clubs four years ago. A: She hasn't even swung them, A: but she wants to get into it now after I came home and won the tournament the other day, B: Really. A: she's she's ready to get off into it, B: Well, great, great. B: That's good, A: but, you know, I like, I just like getting out, being in the outdoors, A: and I'm a hunter and fisher anyway, A: but, you know. B: Yeah, B: same thing here. A: You know, at least I can get out and play a few hours of golf A: and it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg, really. B: Right, B: right. A: And I, you know, I walk, A: I don't ride A: so B: Uh-huh, B: yeah. A: you know, I get a little exercise there, too, A: so. B: That's, B: I've got the same attitude. B: I, uh, I tell you, B: I started, B: I guess, the first time I played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now, when I was in college. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, I took, uh, I took it as a P E course and then kind of left it alone for a while, B: and then finally got, got into it when I was, while I was still in school A: Right. B: and since then, uh, we've made it, um, B: as, as the friends start getting married and things like that, we've made a tradition of, uh, having a, a Thursday, um, B: well, have, have probably like, like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, so, it, B: that's back in South Dakota where I grew up A: Oh. B: and, uh, so that, that's, uh, that's been my main, my main involvement, B: is it seems like I go home and play golf more than I do around here, B: but, uh eventually I get people to come and visit me in Dallas, A: Yeah. B: and then I'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home. A: Yeah, A: it's pretty nice. A: We played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not. A: They were amazed. B: Yeah. A: You know, here it is, sixty-five degrees, A: we're out playing golf, A: and they're freezing cold back there, A: so. But, I, uh, actually I picked it up when I was in high school, on the same as a P E course, you know, B: Yep, B: yep. A: when I got into the service I got into it B: Oh, okay. A: and now when I come out here I just kind of let it go, A: and then one, one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if I played golf. A: And I said, Well, yeah, you know, A: I've got my clubs, A: but I haven't swung them in quite a few years. B: Uh-huh. A: And then I got into it and then back out of it, A: and it just seems like every couple of years I get back in there B: Yeah, B: that's right. A: You know, I really enjoy it. A: It's really nice. B: Oh, it is, it's, it's a lot of fun, especially if you can find somebody that's, uh, that's got the same level of interest. B: That seem to be the hardest thing. A: Yeah. B: Well, about, B: that's, that's true of any sport, you know. B: If you want to play tennis, or racquetball, A: Yeah A: you don't want to go out and get beat to death, A: but. B: Right, B: and, and people don't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time, you know A: No. B: and, and, uh, A: And then, you know, we've got some guys here that they are, you know, four and five handicappers B: Uh-huh. A: and they don't like to play with me because I'm too slow for them, A: so. You know, but get somebody around your own handicap, and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time. B: Right. B: That's right, B: yeah. A: And I've, you know, I've A: never, never yet have I walked up, A: now I've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with, A: and never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome. B: That's true. A: They are always friendly. B: That's true. A: Sure, come on out, you know, A: and they don't mind if you make a mistake, A: they don't mind saying, Well, you know, let me tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that, or, B: Well. A: You know, it's, it's pretty nice and friendly out there B: That, that's, that's so. A: and you can't find that in all sports. B: Yeah, B: that's absolutely right, B: and you can gain a lot of ground doing that, too, if you, if, you know, B: you gets, you get in a rut if you do play a lot B: but you play with the same people, you, you aren't going to learn anything. A: Yeah, B: After a short period, once you learn everything they've got to offer, B: then you've basically tapped your resources there. A: Yeah, A: you need to, A: Yeah. B: But, uh, I'd like to, uh, eventually I'd like to work up, if, if my wife does get interested, and maybe get involved in a league in a, in a mixed, mixed doubles league, or something like that. A: Oh yeah, A: we , we have one down here in the summertime. A: Uh, it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock, you know, because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: And we play in the summertime out here. A: We get a mixed league in, A: and that's what I'm trying to get her ready for. A: It's going to start, well, when we change time back whenever that is next month, I guess, B: Uh-huh. A: and it will start then, A: and, you know, we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago, A: and they were just starting to learn, A: and, you know, they were shooting a hundred, hundred and twenty B: Sure. A: but they were, you know, A: now they're down into the hundreds nineties, B: Right. A: so, it won't take her long. You know, B: Well, that's good that's good, that's sounds like a lot of fun. A: And it's something we can do together, A: so. Well, she doesn't do much hunting, A: she could care less about that. B: Yeah. A: She's does a little fishing, A: but, you know, golf would give her the exercise, A: she'd be outside, A: give her something to do that we both enjoy, A: so. B: Yeah, B: it, it sounds like we've got real similar situations. A: Yeah. B: I, I, I go home, uh, I've gone home every year now since I've moved to Dallas to, to go pheasant hunting, B: and, uh um, the, the last time I, I took my wife along A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, kind of the same situation. B: She's, she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff, B: but, She'll definitely, uh, she'll make the trip for fishing if that comes along, A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: but, uh it's, it's interesting, A: All right. A: Yeah, A: and it's, you know, it's a game that you don't, A: like bowling, you know, you feel bad if you bowl a hundred. A: But if you shoot a hundred in golf, you know, A: you don't have to be an expert to play, B: That's right. A: Any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right. B: Uh-huh. A: So, you know, you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all. B: That's right, B: well, yeah, B: I've, I've kind of formed the attitude that, you know, if I could just, if I could pick two or three shots out, uh, out of my game every time and put them together on one hole, then I do pretty good A: Yeah. B: and then, and I keep, I keep rationalizing that well, you know, I can do it, B: I just got to do it all at on the same hole, B: and, and then it will get better, B: and you just keep going, B: and in the meantime, just enjoy what you're doing. A: Yeah. B: It, it, it really works that way A: And when, you know when I first got back into it, I used to get mad because I knew I could do something A: and I didn't get it done. B: Uh-huh. A: You know, A: and I just, well, I need to slice this ball around here, A: I naturally slice anyway, A: now you know, the ball will go straight A: and I go B: Yeah. A: but, you know I'd get upset about it sometimes, B: Yeah. A: and now I guess, you know, being in my forties, I just kind of mellowed out a little bit. B: Sure. A: I don't get upset any more. A: So, and, B: Sure. B: And well, that's great. A: Well, I've enjoyed talking to you. B: Well, you bet. A: I guess I'll go back to work. B: Okay, B: sounds like it. A: All right. A: See you later . B: Okay. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye. B: Well I haven't had too much They, they keep the, the rain on the outside, little rain drops B: Oh. A: and, and they look real pretty after the rain. A: And so I really like them A: but I need to get out and, and, um, do that. A: Now as far as our grass, it grows crazy here. A: It just keeps growing and growing A: and sometimes my son does it. A: But it just is, A: I don't, I don't know. A: I've lived in Utah my whole life A: and we can't seem to get ours green. A: I don't know. B: Down here, the grass? A: Yeah B: Well, I'm, B: we've had problems with our yard. B: We, B: it was one big weed is what it was. A: Uh-huh. B: It was just horrible. B: And my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns B: and we have this God awful ugly thing. B: And and I know they must think, you know, I wish those people would do something about their yard. A: Crappy I know, A: we have that too. B: But my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff, that, that seems to be helping B: and he put it on the front yard to see how, you know, it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard. A: Uh-huh. B: But we've got a Great Dane in the back A: Uh-huh. B: and she has eaten everything I have put out there. B: She's eaten my crepe myrtle trees. A: Oh dear. B: I know, B: and she's eaten the bushes. B: I've tried to, I spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there A: No. B: and I barricaded it up, so she couldn't get into it. A: Uh-huh. B: And I went and took a shower and looked back out there B: and she was already in it. B: And I was so mad. A: Had somehow gotten in. B: So I can't do anything back A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: But I've tried out in the front B: but like you said that, that freeze that came. A: Uh-huh. B: I had some bushes that, uh, some shrubs I put out front B: and it killed those too. B: So, I'm just real discouraged with the whole thing. B: I just don't even want to do anything. A: The, the other problem that we have, A: well it's funny because the one, the two bushes on the ends of the house that I think are ugly, they lived A: and so I, I don't know. B: Yeah, B: that, that happened to us. B: We have these, A: So like I wanted to go out and kill them too. B: I know. A: They had no right to live. A: But anyway, uh, under our trees we get a, a north sun A: and, uh, the, A: it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them. B: Oh, I know. B: Ours don't. A: And we just can't grow, uh, grass underneath there. B: I know, B: we can't either. B: But I've got two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard. Uh, you know one on either side of the yard. A: Uh-huh. B: And, and they're big B: and they're real full and everything, you know, in the summer time B: but it, it's killing everything underneath where the leaves are shading the tree A: Yeah. B: but toward the end of the summer, you know, when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree, then the grass starts growing. B: But, by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops. B: You know, it's, it's it's a never ending cycle. A: Right. A: It's a vicious cycle, isn't it? B: Yeah, B: it really is. A: It just really, B: So we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and, and whatnot. B: So, A: Well, I don't, A: we've never done anything like this A: but we've been thinking, you know, if we built up, uh, you know, either a wood, wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers, or, or some new bushes in there that would live. B: Uh-huh. A: And so I think that we're going to try that. B: Huh. A: I, I think the I think that's pretty much what we have decided. A: Now I have two long windows B: Yeah. B: Really B: well I don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front B: and they've got mini-blinds and stuff. A: Yeah. B: But only, only one is really like in the flower bed part B: and the other one is out on the porch. A: Yeah. B: So there's not really much I can do about that. A: That's what our two rooms are on the front, too, with these long windows. A: One is a bedroom for our, our oldest son A: and one is, uh, an office that my husband and I work in. A: And so, I, I really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that, A: well, the flowers are out by the back of the house, A: so, and that's why the front room is. A: So that's not too bad. B: Yeah. A: But, I like to look at the flowers. A: They're pretty. B: I do too, B: that's why I look at my neighbors yard A: Yeah. B: I don't have anything to look at B: so I look at theirs. A: But it's funny because, uh, you try so hard I think sometimes to, to, anyway I do, to do our yard B: Uh-huh A: and then it's like the wind blows everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them B: Yeah A: or and so even if you did get it under control, it seems like in just a few months it would all be back A: and B: Yeah. B: It, it's really a pain. B: My husband works a lot B: so, um, a lot, A: It's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work. B: Yeah B: I'm, B: it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard B: and and I just I really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it. A: Uh-huh. B: I hate to mow the yard, more than anything else. B: I hate to mow that yard. A: I know. A: It is, it's not my favorite, thing in the world either. A: I'm glad I have an old enough son to do it for me now. B: Yeah, B: well mine's getting there. B: He helps, B: he does half B: and I do half, A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Yeah A: Well that is one chore that we will pay him for, if he'll go do the yard work out, outside, B: Oh sure I'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it and, and do it to where I don't have to go back out and redo it. A: Right. A: Exactly. B: That, that's my only thing with him. A: Exactly. B: That's why I'm help, having him help me now fade at end of A: Okay, A: well, some of the things I like to do are, A: I like to knit. A: I knit sometimes, A: and I sew B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, I like to sew sometimes for my kids. A: I, I sew clothes for them every once in a while. B: Uh-huh. A: And I make quilts. B: Oh, wow, B: that's the next project that I'd like to learn to do. B: I do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery B: and I'm, I'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch. B: I was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt. A: After a while, cross stitch, I A: I don't know. A: I have to put it away B: It gets boring. A: and then I have to bring it back. B: Uh-huh. A: You know. And, and, uh, I don't know why that is. A: I don't know if it's looking at the little things every time. B: Well, it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging, I think. A: Yeah, A: that might be it. B: But I do a lot of it in the car. A: That might A: and yet, there's, B: We, A: Oh, do you? B: Yeah, B: we commute from Plano to Dallas A: Oh. B: so I have nearly an hour both ways that I can really get a lot of work done B: and I found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car. A: Oh, I bet. A: Yeah. B: I don't know that I could even think about quilting. B: You have to have a pretty good frame, don't you, to do any kind of quilting work? A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Uh, I've not really done any, too much challenging, uh, stuff. A: I, I can do it with a, a needle and thread you know, but, uh, and get about five small stitches in, which is pretty good, B: Uh-huh. A: but it's very long. B: Uh-huh. A: It's very tedious if you don't have a whole group, you're not finishing a quilt in a long time B: Oh, I bet. A: So, uh, B: But, it's such a lost art. A: So, uh, I like to just mostly do the tie quilts. B: Uh-huh. A: That's so much easier. B: Yes. A: But, uh, the other ones are very pretty. A: They're, uh, A: we have a quilt on our bed that's, A: instead of, like, yarn they tied, uh, ribbon into it. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: And it's real pretty. B: I bet. A: It's real pretty. B: There's so many things I wish I had learned to do with my mother. B: She had crocheted a full bedspread. B: It's kind of a hobnail looking thing. A: Oh, wow. B: And when I look at it now, she's been dead for a long time I think oh, why didn't I learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that people just don't know how to do. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Now did you say you could knit? B: No. A: Oh. B: Uh-huh. B: Haven't tried that either. A: Well, I was going to say because, Because if you could knit, you could crochet. B: I want to learn to crochet. B: I, B: Really? A: It's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to, to weave the, the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand. B: Uh-huh. A: And then you just use your right hand with the hook. B: Uh-huh. A: And that's not, A: it's really not too difficult. A: You could learn that, I'm sure and pick that up. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: If you, I think if you can do any handicraft, you can learn to crochet. B: Uh-huh. A: It's not too difficult. B: It's funny, when you were talking about sewing, I love to do anything by hand with a needle. A: Yeah B: But I'm totally intimidated if I sit down at a sewing machine. B: I never learned, B: and I get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me. A: Isn't that interesting. B: But I just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew. A: I think that's really interesting. B: Uh-huh. A: Huh. A: And yet, you know, I think about, you know, A: you said you do a lot of needlework A: and, and there are some beautiful, just gorgeous patterns that people do. B: Uh-huh. A: And I, I just think that, uh, that's one of, one of the arts that I think are really pretty. A: And a lot of people don't do that either. B: Uh-huh. A: You know, and so, B: Well, it's hard to find the time. B: I, I wouldn't if I didn't have this car time ability probably because at night if I sit down, I'm doing something with the kids or just not sitting down at all A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: That's true. A: You know, and, and I always think, well, I can do this and watch T V or something you know. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, it seems like I always get my mind carried away to something else A: and then it doesn't quite work B: Well, it, A: or, B: I'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary. B: It's so I find myself putting glasses on to, to watch T V and then taking them off to do needlework B: and I get frustrated doing that B: so Just give it up. A: And, you know, I like to sketch. A: I can, I can sketch something, like if I see a picture, like, out of a book, I can sketch that B: Ooh. A: and that's nice and everything, A: but, you know, it's funny, A: I can't I can't draw it out of my own head kind of thing. B: Uh-huh. A: I wish I could. A: And, and yet I can't do, you know, like, like, uh, craft, uh, on wood. B: Uh-huh. A: I can't do that painting thing. B: Yeah. A: And yet, B: I'm the same way. B: If I see something, I can copy it, B: but I certainly can't create. B: I admire people that have that in their minds already. A: Yeah, A: me, too. A: Me, too. A: I know a woman who's just wonderful at that. B: Uh-huh. A: And I look at it A: and, you know, you look at those things A: and you wish so badly that you could do them. A: I guess, if you wanted to, you could take classes and learn. A: I guess that's the only way I could do it. B: Well, sometimes, even with that. I, I think you have to have some, A: Okay, A: what kind of fishing do you do? B: Well, mostly, uh, a, a little fresh water fish, B: but mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because I used to live in Utah. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, down here I haven't fished much in Texas. A: That's one of the few things I've ever fished for is rainbow trout. B: Oh, they're really not, B: I think they're good to eat. A: What, what kind of bait do you use to catch them? B: Oh, just, usually worms, night crawlers. B: Sometimes fish eggs. A: Oh, really? B: Sometimes A: Fish eggs? B: Yeah. A: Oh, I didn't know that. A: Huh. B: Just little, just little fish eggs. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, there's this one kind of cheese that you can put on the end of a hook B: and it will stay relatively well A: Oh, I didn't know that. B: Yeah A: That's a great way. B: and, and they really like that. A: I think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish, B: Now I have never caught catfish. A: personally I like to catch large mouth bass and catfish because they fight the best B: Uh-huh. B: Because they fight the best A: But a, a catfish will really just tear into anything like that, like liver or, uh, cheese or anything that smells terrible B: Oh, is that right? B: Now in Amarillo did you fish any of this ? A: Uh, no. A: Actually I always used to go to my grandparents' in Oklahoma A: and they have the, uh, Lake Texoma right next to them. A: So the, A: we used to catch some, uh, sand bass off Lake, there's a Roosevelt Bridge A: and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom and crank up, you know turns on the reel about six to twelve times B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: and the fish would be sitting at different levels. B: Oh, how about that. A: So, yeah, A: you just leave it at that level A: and in no time something would hit it A: and you could pull them up two and three times in a row, A: but you had to find out what level, how many cranks they were off the bottom. A: And if you left it on the bottom, there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish. B: Oh. A: And, of course, depending on how big your bait was, uh, you know, would be depending on what you caught. B: Oh, I think that is really interesting. A: Yeah, A: that was a lot of fun. A: My grandfather used to do that A: and we used to have a light at the top of the water. B: Uh-huh. A: He'd really spoiled me in that respect. B: I think they're, B: see, and I wish I could go fishing here because I don't really know much about the fishing here. B: I guess it would, B: if you did it like you were just, uh, saying, that's pretty much like rainbow trout. A: Uh-huh. B: You bait the hook, B: you throw it in, B: you troll it a little bit A: Uh-huh. B: and then you wait A: Yeah. B: and they troll it a little bit. A: Well, if you, A: do you have any friends with ponds? B: No. B: I don't A: I, uh, A: well, if you can A: well, or even a lake. A: If, uh, A: seems like every time somebody's on the bank, all they want to do is throw it out just as far as they can and, uh, bring it in to you. B: Yeah. A: But it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat. A: You, you want to make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm and just have it come into the water like a, a regular animal or, or fish uh, well, you know, something coming off from the bank like they usually do B: Oh, uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: So you don't have to really get, uh, fish from a boat, you know, because they're actually right there at the shore. B: Huh. A: But, I didn't used to be sold on plastic worms, A: but, uh, if, A: I am now B: You are now. A: Oh, yeah B: I've never used those. B: That's really interesting. A: Yeah. A: It just, uh, just a slow reel A: and then let it sit on the bottom, A: but the key is to always have your line tight. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: And that way you can feel when they're hitting it, A: and believe me you'll know the difference. B: Uh, what kind of fish do you like the best to eat? A: Oh, crappie actually. B: Oh, do you A: Yeah A: I've been fishing in the, the ocean. A: We're about three hours from the ocean. A: And I also like Spanish mackerel. A: And you catch blues A: and, uh, that's a different kind of fishing off the pier, too. A: Have you ever fished off the pier? B: I've done fishing like that B: but, but, uh, tell me what, uh, where you'd catch crappie. B: My, my neighbor has gone before and, and done that, A: Uh-huh. B: but, A: Oh, the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits and, and jigs. A: Uh, they have like yellow, uh, fuzz on a hook, you know, that kind of comes out. B: Oh, oh, I know. A: Yeah. B: Uh, they're sort of like, well, I want to say flies, B: but not exactly like, A: Yeah, A: get, A: but they're a little heavier A: and they're bigger. B: Yeah. A: Get the yellow ones. B: The yellow. A: Those are the ticket B: Okay A: And let them drop to the bottom and maybe do a, a kind of a slow reel. A: You don't even have to have a good rod or anything. Just, just even a regular line B: Uh-huh. A: and you throw it out A: and, uh, the, the other thing that's real good is small, uh, A: it's a real small rapalla . A: It's about an inch and a half long A: and they're pure all silver, something real shiny about that long. B: Uh-huh. A: They'll go after that in a heartbeat also. Just anything that really shines or spins. B: Yeah, B: my mom, she just loves to fish B: and she has a lot of those, those little, uh, B: they almost look neon. B: You know, they're just real colorful things on, onto her end. A: Oh, yeah, A: yeah. A: That's it. B: Yeah. B: And she she's really a good fisher woman. A: Oh, really? B: Yeah. A: That's neat. B: Well, you sound like you're a good fisher woman, too. B: Hi, Clarice. B: Um, have you had a family reunion recently? A: Yes, A: just this last summer we went back to Utah, A: and we met, it was my, A: we usually go to my family reunion, A: but this one was my husband's B: Uh-huh. A: and they're usually quite similar, I think. B: Are you both from Utah originally? A: No, A: he's from here B: Oh, uh-huh. A: but, uh, most of his people are from Oregon, A: so we kind of met halfway B: Uh-huh. A: and so, this was one, A: and they, um, planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and had, you know, B: Oh, how nice. A: things like that have to be planned, A: like they had planned A: that, we went to the reunion in end of June and first of July that part the fourth of July weekend, B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: but we had to plan everything like clear in December, January to reserve that. B: Sure, B: sure, B: Now was this his entire family, cousins, aunts, uncles like that or his immediate family? A: Uh-huh. A: No B: Oh, wow. A: this was everybody. B: Oh wow, B: how many people were there? A: Oh, I, oh, I, jeez, I think over, um, three hundred were there. B: Wow. A: It was quite a large B: Wow. A: it was a great big lodge, A: and so we had plenty of room and everything, A: and some of them live in that area, A: so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave. B: Uh-huh. A: But, um, that was a great big thing, A: and we do that with his family about every five years, a great big one. A: And then like immediate family we do, like we try to do one thing once a year. B: Now how many, how many people are in his immediate family? A: Well, he has eight brothers and sisters B: Oh, wow. A: so that's big by itself. B: Wow, B: it really is, B: and you get together once a year. A: Yeah. B: Wow, A: So we have a little shindig with them. B: Are they all here in the area, B: or are they scattered? A: Um they're close, in a close proximity. A: Um, let's see, A: there are four of them who live here in Texas, and his mom and dad. B: Uh-huh. A: So, um, the others live in close neighboring, um, states, like Nevada, Arizona I think like that, B: Uh-huh. A: yeah B: Oh wow, B: that's wonderful. A: so, it's been fun. A: How about you? B: Well, we don't really get together, B: I, I would love to, B: and that's why I checked that I wanted to do that, because I would love to plan a family reunion sometime. B: Um, I have a sister in Colorado, and, uh, a sister in upstate New York, and a sister in Connecticut, and here I am in Texas. B: So we're kind of scattered right now. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, my, my cousins have a, you know, they put on a family reunion, um, once a year, B: but it's always like the second week in September, B: so it's, B: the kids are already back in school A: Uh-huh. B: and so, and that's back in the A: That's hard. B: and that's in New York, B: and there's no way, I mean there's just no possible way. A: Yeah, A: Yeah. B: And it's not really a weekend, B: it's just like a day kind of thing, because most of them are, you know, um, B: my family moved to Connecticut, B: the rest of the family stayed in New York and, uh, on Long Island, A: Uh-huh. B: and so, they're all kind of local and close, B: and so they just have a, you know, a day picnic, B: and, uh, I've always thought it would be so neat, even if it were just my immediate family, to have like a weekend type thing A: Yeah. B: that would be so wonderful A: It really is fun, A: and my mom's family does it once a year, just like you said B: Uh-huh. A: once a year, um, they have a, a, a Wednesday through a, a Saturday type thing. A: You can come and go as you please type thing. B: Oh, wow. A: And they do that once a year. A: I kind of missed it this year, and felt bad, A: but you can't go every year, A: you just cannot do that. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: Yeah. A: Um. B: And do they, they have a hotel, B: or where do you stay? A: Um, basically, they just stay with each other, brothers or sisters. A: There are enough in the area to, to just kind of span yourself out. B: Take everybody, B: yeah. A: Whoever's mom and dad it is, you usually go and stay with them, A: like I go stay with my mother, A: and my cousins, they just go stay with their mom and dad, you know kind of thing. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: And so it's not hard in, in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area B: Yeah, B: yeah, A: so that's not hard, A: but the real planning, that's the real key B: Oh, that sounds so wonderful, B: isn't that nice. B: Yeah. A: and they send out, A: my mom's family now, A: this is the first reunion with my husband's family I've really been involved with, A: but my mom's family, each brother and sister takes a turn one year, A: and that's how they divide it up B: Uh-huh. B: But then one brother and sister from each family. B: Uh-huh. A: and each one of them take their turn. B: Oh, wow, B: uh-huh. A: And then the, the parent who's turn it is, the child whose turn it is her children help her, B: Uh-huh. A: like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing. B: Oh, I see, uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, wow, A: Yeah, A: and, um, the thing is, that, um, the, the real part is there are two mailings that go out, A: and the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making, A: Okay. A: What do you think of the public school system? A: First off, do you have children that are in it? B: I have children that are in the Plano Public School systems B: and I am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school, system A: Oh, okay B: So, A: Well then, you should be a good one to know because I, my children are grown now. A: I now have grandchildren, in the school system B: Oh. A: so, uh, I don't have firsthand experience right now, with it. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: So what do you think? B: Well, I think the public school systems are doing a good job. B: I think they have a long way to go yet B: but I think that, um, they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier. B: You know, my kindergartners were on the, were on the computers, B: and I think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done. B: And I think that, uh, the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them, you know, skills. A: Right. B: you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together. B: And I think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think, B: they literally cannot come in out of the rain. A: That's right B: You know, and that just, B: I don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted. A: Right. B: And, uh, this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education. B: So I think, you know, they're, they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have, B: and I think that's very, very important. A: Yes, A: it is. A: I, I agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren, A: we have a, uh, fourth grader A: and then we have one that's in kindergarten A: and, and I know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing, were doing in the fifth and sixth grade. B: Oh, yeah. B: Oh, yeah. B: I tutor a girl that's in eighth grade B: and her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my Algebra Two, when I was in high school. A: Is that scary? B: And it's like, oh, I going to take this home and study it before I can help you. A: Right. B: You know, so they're really, they're really moving them along B: but yet, at the same time, you know, they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life. A: Now, B: And that's you know, B: a lot of the things that we did in school I've never used and never will use. A: Yes. B: And, uh, so I think that it's, it's appropriate to teach them, you know, why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this. A: Correct. A: Are you finding that, uh, since you're doing substitute, that you're wanting to do full-time? A: Um, I have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms. B: Yes, B: that's a, A: And, and A: are you, do you find that? B: Well, filling out the forms and also all of these, uh, statewide and national wide testing, things so that they compare A: Uh-huh. B: and . You know, you can as far as I'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say. A: Uh-huh. B: And it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it. B: And you waste so much time quote, unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be, you know, that I think it's, uh, I think it's crazy personally A: Be, A: uh-huh. B: You know, the the whole first nine weeks of school is, is used as a review B: but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in, October. So that you know, your school district shines throughout the United States. A: Coming up, A: uh-huh. B: And I think that's totally useless. B: I think, you know, there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons B: but I think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous. B: It's like bragging on your grandchildren. A: Right B: You know, and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth B: and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this, B: and that's great. B: But that's what they're doing with the school systems B: and they're wasting too much time on that, I think. A: Well, I, I know that this again this, this friend, uh, is in the Plano School District, B: Uh-huh. A: and she teaches, uh, uh, it uh, emotionally disturbed children. B: Uh-huh. A: And she says she has, um, six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade. B: Yes. A: But because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something. A: I didn't quite understand it. B: Yeah, B: there's a, B: yeah. A: And, uh, B: The bottom line is always money, A: Laurie? B: Yes. A: Okay. A: I'm supposed to ask you, how do you make use of your credit cards A: and I'm supposed to compare those with my, my habits. B: Okay. B: How do I make use of credit cards? A: Yes. B: Um, let's see. B: I carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly because I don't ever have cash. A: Right. B: And I I, B: do you work for Texas Instruments? A: No, A: I do not. B: Okay. B: Well, at T I we have to use what's called a tex teller if we want to get cash out A: Uh-huh. B: and those are only available at T I. A: Oh, okay. B: So if I'm in a mall or something I can't get cash out without paying extra money B: so I'm always using credit cards. A: Sure. A: Well, myself I always, A: I'm, I'm a traveling person B: Uh-huh. A: and I'm out of town quite a bit A: so I use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lounging, entertainment and for everything. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: me too. A: So that's, uh, A: as far as using them outside that I'm not, I don't use them too much A: but I, I think my wife is sort of like you A: she uses a credit card, most of the time. B: Yeah A: So she does most of the shopping for our household A: so she'll use them more than I will. B: Uh-huh. B: But do you get to pay the bills? A: Yes. B: Same at my house A: So it's me I'm always, I'm the guy that always goes to like Dillard's A: and I'll go in and charge something A: and I'll have to give them my driver's license. A: They'll have to look up the number because I'm never carrying a credit card. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: But I do carry like my American Express and my Visa which I use for, you know, primarily work type things. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: This is my first call by the way, A: so B: Oh, it's mine too. A: Oh, is it really? B: Yes. A: All right A: so we're both beginners then. B: Yeah. A: I've had this for a couple weeks A: and I've been out of town A: so this is my first time to, to use it. B: Oh, okay. B: Okay. A: So, B: Now, did you pick this topic B: or were you given? A: No, A: I was given this topic. B: I see. B: Okay. A: Yeah, A: they give you, they assign you a topic, A: you call the eight hundred number, B: Right. A: Have you tried it yet? B: No A: Okay. A: When you call the eight hundred number, they assign you a topic and, uh, pretty, uh, cut and dried B: Huh, B: okay. B: Um, let's see. B: So how long are we supposed to talk for? A: I'm not sure. A: A couple, A: about two three minutes I think. B: Okay. A: But I really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards. A: I, A: one thing I've always tried to do is when I get my credit cards, I always try to pay them off because I just sort of detest paying interest. B: Oh, yes. A: And, uh, B: Definitely. A: like years ago my wife and I got married B: Uh-huh. A: she was the one with a little bit than I was because I had my credit cards, I think, up to the limit A: and I was giving everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that. B: Oh. B: That will cost you a fortune. A: That was like thirty years ago A: so now it's a little different. A: We, A: I get a bill A: and I'll pay it the same day it comes B: Yes, B: yes. A: and I just kind of tell my kids how much I hate paying interest A: so they should follow the same rule. B: That's right. B: Well, yeah, A: Oh, you bet it's A: it's an absolute savings. B: Or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in, you get to keep the money. A: You bet. A: That's, that's very handy. B: Yeah. B: It works great. A: Well, I think that's all I have. B: Okay. B: Well, it was nice to meet you. A: Nice to meet you A: and, uh, give it a try. A: I think you'll enjoy it. B: Okay. A: Okay. B: Thanks. A: Thank you. B: Bye-bye. A: Bye. A: In, in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot, I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem. B: Do you? B: Why? A: Why? A: Well, if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to, so they could become doctors, the problem would go away. B: You think the problem is not enough doctors? A: I think the problem is that the doctor doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums on your uh, I mean, on your liability. B: Gosh, for one thing. A: Oh? A: Uh-huh. A: And you think there are plenty of doctors? B: Oh, yeah, B: I don't think there is a shortage of doctors B: and I do know that O B, which is my field the doctors' health the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year that deliver babies. A: Uh-huh. A: It's astronomical. B: Now they can't doing anything about that. B: I don't think they're in a conspiracy. B: I think it's our fault, because we as people just sue them. A: No, A: people don't sue B: People are very sue, sue conscious. A: lawyers sue. A: If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor B: Yeah. B: Well, that's probably true, too. B: But people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days. A: Well, sure. B: And, so, A: But, you know, when you think about reasonableness, now, I believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory. A: You know what tort theory is? B: No. A: Well, a tort is when you do something wrong. B: Right. A: Well, it, uh, A: an O B G Y N doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent. B: That's right. A: If the baby is born dead, well, that happens. B: Well, A: If, if they have complications and, B: It depends. A: Well, I know, I mean, there are guys that are real slobs, A: but you know, there are also people out there that are really doing their job. B: Well, that's true, B: they are because doctors are performing many more tests. B: Many of them are unnecessary, B: they are doing so many C sections just to prevent. A: Just to prevent a a law suit. B: Because they have all these monitors now B: and if anything looks even a little bit funny their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby, A: Yeah. B: and so it's costing more all around in health insurance for tests, for surgery, for longer hospital stay. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. A: See, I believe that there, there is a system already in place for health care. B: So, it's terrible. B: Uh-huh. A: You know, they have indigent health care. A: You show up at Parkland bleeding B: You'll get it. B: That's true. B: In fact, you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there, too. A: Yeah. B: And we have that happen. B: We have patients that go through Parkland through the clinic A: Uh-huh. B: and at the last minute, they come to us. B: Well uh, we can't turn them away. A: Uh-huh B: So, A: Yeah, A: I think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate. B: Yeah. B: I'm for that. B: I've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer, B: so I'd like to wipe them all out A: Yeah. A: Well, I, I happen to know a few A: and I even claim one as a friend. A: He's a divorce attorney. A: But, B: He better not be mine A: I think he'll go nameless for the, for the purposes of this conversation. A: But I also know an, uh, O B G Y N who has stopped practicing. B: Yeah, B: some they do. A: Uh, he just said, B: They stop their O B at least. A: Yeah, A: I mean, he's not going to deliver any more babies ever. B: Right, B: Right. A: His malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year. B: That's incredible. A: And, you know, he said, I had to, he had to gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice. B: Yeah. B: And most of them are very sincere. B: Most of them do the best they can. A: Yeah B: They are human. B: Occasionally something will go wrong. B: Well, you can be human and Catholic. A: I know you can be human and Catholic, A: but, you're not likely to find somebody who is going to, you know, have a less conscientious effort. B: Yeah, B: no A: I mean, B: most of them do. B: I really believe that. B: From dealing with doctors, dealing with lawyers, there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious. A: Well, you know, who is getting rich? A: Insurance companies. B: Yeah, B: they are. A: You know, if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance, A: say, say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed A: or, B: Well, um, I have a, a, a former exercise program. B: I'm a graduate student, B: and this semester, I'll tell you what, I, it's been almost impossible for me to get, you know, back to regular exercise. B: Um, last summer I was a, a swim instructor all summer and, and life guard, B: so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming B: and, um, and since I worked at a recreation center I could, uh, you know, use those facilities quite often. B: But, um. B: Oh, yeah. B: Oh, yeah. A: and and it's least hard on your body, B: Uh-huh, B: and there's and there's no jarring on the. A: I, B: Pardon? A: It's the least hard on your body as far as, uh, impact B: Exactly, yeah, B: um, A: and B: yeah, B: fluid resistance. A: Right, A: right. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. B: How about you? A: Well, I do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week, A: but it's not enough to, A: boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles B: Oh, yeah. A: and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, uh half hour or so, B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: but so, I'm not quite getting the level that I need to. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: Do you, do you kind of think it's a chore, B: or do you enjoy it? A: I like it. B: Uh-huh. A: I like it, uh, A: part of my problem is I have small children, A: so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh, B: Uh-huh. B: Sure, B: yeah. A: Of course, you got a little different direction going, A: but, uh. B: Uh-huh, B: yeah. B: Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds, B: and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. Um, B: so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college, B: and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly, B: and so I got my weight down, B: and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be I don't worry about it A: Right, A: you don't notice it as much, B: , yeah. A: yeah. B: Uh-huh. B: Although lately I have noticed, you know, even if I gain, like two pounds, I start, I start feeling it B: and, A: You feel it, don't you? B: Uh-huh. A: It's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes, A: and I weigh probably about the same I weighed for, oh, I don't know how many years, A: but, uh, it's changed places A: And things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same. B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, so, do you do, uh, A: in Texas, uh, does A: there, probably quite a few facilities. B: Yeah, B: there are. B: Um, I'm living in a dorm right now, B: and so right downstairs there's a facility. B: And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there A: Do you enjoy it, A: or is it, uh. A: If you can have, find the time it's just the. B: Uh-huh B: yeah, B: I really do, because I like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while, B: but that's hard, you know. A: Yeah, A: it is hard B: Uh-huh. A: it is hard. A: It's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour. B: Uh-huh. A: My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more B: Exactly. A: Don't get enough sleep as it is, A: right B: Uh-huh, B: yeah, B: yeah. A: and, uh, kind of have, A: if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of, A: course it's really, you know, A: as soon as you do it, it's really a release. B: Oh, yeah. A: You feel invigorated A: and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: ready to go another twelve hours. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something. B: Uh-huh. B: Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly? A: I do. A: I have to be real careful. B: Uh-huh. B: I stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago. A: Did you? B: Uh-huh, B: completely. B: I mean, any kind of meat B: or, and I, and I really feel a lot better now. A: Makes a lot of difference. B: Yeah, B: it really does. A: Well, there's a lot of fat in meat. B: Uh-huh, B: yeah, B: that's it, I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from A: Right. B: and so. I found that really helps. A: And unless you really like, uh, fish. A: Fish is pretty good for you, A: but, uh. B: Yeah, B: I eat that, B: I think I've eaten fish like twice since. B: I used to eat a lot of fish, too, B: but I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens. A: Kind of see what happens. B: Yeah, B: and I like it. A: I've tried to do that with sugar B: I don't know if I'm that brave yet . A: everything has sugar in it . A: I mean, if you go, A: your ketchup has sugar in it. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: Course, A: and I like sugar, too, A: that's that's a problem, B: Uh-huh. A: but. A: Anyway, well, it's, uh, nice talking to you. A: Think we've, uh, covered all the subject. B: Okay, B: yeah, B: it sounds good. A: Okay. B: Well, good luck to you there in Idaho. A: Well, you, too. A: Good luck, uh, A: enjoy college while you can. A: Let me tell you it's, uh. B: Well, I'm in graduate school now. B: I, I, I kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now A: It's a little different, uh challenge, isn't it? B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: it is. B: Well, it's good talking, A: Where are you going studying? B: Pardon? B: I'm studying speech pathology. A: Right. A: do you see as, uh, the changes that have occurred in the last , A: Beverly. B: I think one of the thing that I notice a lot, B: I know it's touching social changes, B: but, uh, to me what becomes socially acceptable, B: and I, I don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction, B: but I notice things on T V being more, um, open, more I believe, uh, B: they portray things on T V obviously that they never would have years ago, B: and, you know, and specifically, nudity, things like that, uh, B: I don't know, B: I, I've said several times to my husband that I feel like gee, in ten years they'll have just full nudity on T V B: and nobody will think anything of it, B: and to me that's surprising. B: To me, that's, that's a big change to accept it, B: and it comes across, I think subtly, you know, a little at a time, to where you get so used to seeing a little change, that, you know, when they go one step further, you don't notice it that much. B: That's one of the biggest ones I've seen. A: Huh, A: yeah, A: that's a big one. B: What about you? A: Well, I think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions. A: Somebody else, uh, made them do it. A: Uh, that's what I seem to see a lot of, that, uh, no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices. A: It's rather, sue these guys because they made a uh, a seat belt that didn't work right A: or uh, that's what I think is a big one. B: Uh-huh. B: I tend to agree with you, B: and I think there's a lot of that. B: Um, yeah, B: we have become lawsuit happy. B: Any little thing, it's like let's see what I can get. B: Don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from, um, oh, you know, the, the, the era we went through that was like, you know, hey if it makes you happy, do it. B: You know, kind of like, disregard to others, B: do what makes you happy, B: and, and yes, B: we should take care of ourselves, you know, B: and we should see to our own lives, but not to a total disregard of others. B: Um, I don't know, B: I think it's come to that a lot. B: I see it a lot in my daughter. B: I have a four year old. A: Uh-huh. B: And hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through, B: but whenever something happens it's, you made me hit that, B: you made me do this, B: and so I try to tell her, , everything isn't always somebody else's fault. B: You know, you have to watch where you're going B: and and so it's what you just said, kind of hits home to me, just through her. A: Sure. A: Yeah, A: and, another thing I think has changed quite a bit is, uh, the roles that men and women play. A: That's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly. B: Um, in your opinion, good or bad, or both? A: Well, both, you know, A: there's some great things that, uh, have come about with more equality, A: but I think that also, A: I don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that, because I think that's bad for us. B: I do too. B: I think part of that, B: I don't know, B: I think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling like, in terms of their self confidence, their self worth, you know, I can do something, B: I can be somebody, you know, B: if I put my mind to it, I can accomplish things too. B: And I think that's good, B: but, um, I think when you push, you know, maybe I think when that was first trying come about with, you know, what we know as the women's lib movement A: Uh-huh. B: I think it was too extreme. B: Um, I think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too, you know, B: and I think there's definite roles, B: and I think, you know, part of the break up of the family, maybe it's because of the, the, the social changes, B: I don't know, B: the fact that, uh, during their early changes where, you know, women did come more, speak, maybe speak out, I was going to say, come more out of themselves, B: but speak out, B: I think a lot of men were threatened by that. B: I think now less men are, you know, because they're used to it, B: it's around them. B: Um, but I, I don't know, B: I, I, I don't know why the families are breaking up. B: I think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions, because it's like they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is going to work. B: They go in and say, well, hey, you know, I'll stick with it while it's good, B: and then I'll get out. B: And I, I, I think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment. A: Yeah, A: I would agree with you. A: Uh, A: What kind of movies have you been seeing lately? B: Uh, it's been probably a month or so since I've been to the movies. B: Course, my, my favorite now is, is DANCES WITH WOLVES. A: Oh, it's an excellent movie. B: Uh, SILENCE OF THE uh, of the LAMBS was good. A: SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? B: Uh-huh. A: What was that anyway? B: Oh, it's a, I guess it's a mystery, you'd call it. B: It's with, uh, Jodie Foster. A: Okay. B: And it, uh, it's pretty good. B: Another one that I think I really liked was, uh, THE FISHER KING. A: Uh-huh. A: Let's see, A: who was in FISHER KING? A: That was, um, Robin Williams A: and, uh and, uh, I can't the last name. B: Right. B: How about you? B: What are you? A: Uh, we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately. A: Um, we really enjoyed, um, DEAD POETS' SOCIETY. B: Yes. A: Um, several years back one we saw, we saw we really, really enjoyed was, uh, ORDINARY PEOPLE, with, uh, Timothy Hutton and, uh, Mary Tyler Moore, A: and, uh, uh, who played the father, anyway B: Right. A: excellent movie. B: That was, that was an excellent movie. B: Have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES? A: Yes A: we have. B: What'd you think of it? A: Oh, we loved it. B: I don't think I can see it enough times. A: I know what you mean. A: I know what you mean. B: Course I'm a Kevin Costner fan. A: Yeah, A: just threw it away. A: Uh-huh. B: So, a little different. B: And I wanted to do this thing that you can get through Target, to recycle. B: I had my school do it, B: but my principal said since we're doing this thing called Operation Desert Shield, we're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all that A: Yeah. B: The whole school, you know, B: it was just this big project, B: she didn't want to get into that. B: And I could do it in the center, B: and I just never got around to it. B: But, it's like a club, B: you know about that? A: No. B: A little boy that had died of leukemia, I think, B: and he had started this, um, save the environment club. A: Oh. B: And his mother is carrying this on. B: And you can get the information to set it up, you know and join, A: Uh-huh. B: you don't have to join it as a group or anything, I don't guess. A: Oh, that'd be B: But you could start your own anyway. B: Get a pamphlet, A: Is that what this target is, A: what you're, B: Do you all have Target stores up there? A: No. B: No. A: Huh-uh. B: That's a department store. A: Oh. B: Kind of like K Mart except it's a little better than what K Mart sells, I think. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh. A: I would like, A: let's start up a Target. A: No. A: Um, I don't really know any other recycling that they do. B: So, you're not you're not having it picked up at your houses or anything. A: No. A: No, A: huh-uh. A: We have to take it to a recycling place. B: Huh. B: Now in some of the towns around us, they're already picking up the newspapers. A: Uh-huh. B: Well, they're doing that here, too, now that I think about it voice in Once every so many weeks, B: and you have to pull out all the slicks, B: and you have to wrap them up with string. A: Oh. B: And, I think that's all they're picking up. B: But you know, like in Minnesota, they've got their bins where you put plastics and your bottles. A: Oh, I didn't know that. B: Yeah, B: because my brother-in-law lives in Minnesota, B: and they're are just nice, plastic bins, B: and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash, B: and they pick them up. A: Um. I never heard of that in B: Do you all have can banks? A: Um, not that I know of B: No? A: No. B: in I B: a big old bin, B: and you just feed your cans slowly into the slot, B: and your money comes out, you know, every once in a while, for however much poundage you've got. B: And if you keep feeding it until the light goes off. And you get instant cash. A: Oh my gosh. B: But they had one that I was putting my stuff in, B: and I went to take some today, B: and it was gone. A: Um. B: I don't know. B: But I located another one today on the way to work. A: Yeah, A: uh, we have places where we go A: and we, what we do is we unload our cans. A: It's like a conveyor belt, A: and the belt separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because it has a magnet on it. A: And then they weigh, uh, your aluminum cans, A: and then you get money for your aluminum cans. B: But they don't give you for the other. A: No. A: But now they're going to start giving us money for the other ones, too. A: Before, they didn't. A: But I know they're going to start now. B: Uh-huh. B: Well they're certain places, you know, where down there you can take your leaded cans. B: But I don't know where they are. B: They publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't know. B: I'm trying B: but, I just can't recycle everything. A: Yeah, A: yeah B: I'm not that dedicated. A: Yeah. B: But. A: Well, that's all I really know about recycling. B: Me, too. B: If they would. B: Oh, I know, we're saving our grocery bags now. A: Oh really? B: Yeah, B: they're taking those up. B: You can take them to the stores B: Um, like Kroger's doing it. B: And I think Skaggs. B: Do you have those up there? A: We have Kroger, but not a Skaggs. B: And we, B: they're taking our milk cartons and our plastic coke bottles there, too. A: Oh. B: So. A: Uh. B: That's pretty good isn't it. A: You guys are getting into it more than we are. B: It sounds like it, B: you'd think you would be. A: Uh-huh. A: Huh-uh, A: I've never seen any, you know, places that do. A: I know, um, we reuse our grocery bags now. A: We take them back, you know, and use the ones that we have. A: You can like, A: if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones. B: You mean where you sack your own groceries. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: but we don't have any place that collects the grocery bags. B: Huh. B: And I don't want to go with those canvas bags right now, I'm sorry. B: I'm not that European B: But you know, they do that like, B: I went to Europe, nineteen seventy-three. A: Uh-huh. B: And, you know, they go all the time. B: It's like they would go almost every day to the store. B: And they had their little bags way back then, and fill it up. A: Uh-huh. B: And they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators. A: Oh, my. B: That's why. B: They couldn't put anything in it hardly. B: But, A: Uh. B: Well, what are you going to do when you get out of college? A: I'm a finance major. B: Well, that's why I did what I did. B: I went into teaching B: Here in Texas it's a real mess right now. A: Oh, really. B: Oh definitely. B: There's no. B: Let's see, B: we've had the funding, B: we've run out of money. B: We've frozen the money. B: Right? B: And they had until the fifteenth of April to come up some formula that would be more equitable to different districts according to finances, because the poor districts were getting less money, so not as good an education. A: Uh-huh. B: Right? B: And now they're trying to take some money away from the richer districts, like the one that I'm in, in Dallas, and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable. B: And if they can't come up with something by the fifteenth, then the state's supposed to decide, the courts. A: What do you think the outcome will be? B: I think they're maybe going to give us a state income tax. B: Do you have one? A: Yeah B: I'm not looking forward to it, B: but something's got to be done. A: Yeah. A: Oh yeah, A: we've had one as long as I can remember B: Well, it's going to hit us. A: Yeah B: And I don't know, B: doesn't seem like it work to take it away when we're using it. B: But maybe, B: I know we're not using it so wisely. A: Uh-huh. B: We have too many administrators in some of these big districts. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: But other than that. Well, can you think of anything else we need to talk about. A: Um, I can't think of anything on recycling. B: Me, either. B: Anything else? A: No. B: What about people from, um, Pennsylvania. B: What do they think about Texans? A: What do we think about them? B: Uh-huh. A: Oh, I don't know B: Have you thought about that? A: No, A: I never really thought about it A: what you think about Pennsylvanians. B: Probably a lot more civilized, more, um, refined than a lot of the people would be down here. A: Oh really B: I would hope so, B: I mean you've been together a little bit longer than we have. A: I don't know, A: I really don't know anyone from Texas or anything. B: No. A: I've never been there, um. B: Well I've never, B: well let's see, B: I think I have too been to Pennsylvania. B: Gettysburg? A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: we went up there. Now that I think about it. On one of our long trips we take off on. A: Uh-huh A: Oh, well B: Shboom. B: child in What are you saying, Holly? B: talking to Oh, my little girl is in the second grade, told me to tell you that Shboom means good-bye in the Israeli language. A: Oh. B: child in is what you say it is, Holly? In Israel, in Israel. B: on See she's got this little girl from Israel in her classroom that she's befriended. A: Oh. B: So she's into this. A: Oh, is it like a foreign exchange type student? B: Huh-uh. B: You know we've had a lot of the Jewish people ... B: Colorado Springs. A: Oh, right, A: up in, uh, T I out there? B: Yeah. A: Oh, right B: Did you hit one. A: Yeah. A: I just hit one then. B: All right. A: Uh, B: The savings and loan scandal. A: It, A: I, got to, uh, A: this is going to be fun. A: Are you Republican or Democrat? B: Uh, kind of neither. A: Okay, A: well, I'm a, I'm a Democrat A: so I was going to say if you're a Republican, boy we would really have a good time. B: I do have some Republican leanings, because, I am division one, you know A: Well, I, uh, A: to answer that one before we get to our subject, you know, I always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was, though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money A: and they're the ones wasting all the money. A: And, I always wondered how they can play the money either way they want, you know. A: I get a kick out of that. A: But, anyway, the subject, go ahead. A: You first. B: Uh, I think it's a stinking shame that there isn't capital punishment for those assholes that stold our money. A: Yeah. A: I, uh, I don't think it's over. A: I think that, uh, so many other things have taken over, uh, in the media. A: But, I think it was just plain greed, A: and I think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks. A: Go ahead loan your money out, you know. B: I agree with you. B: I think it had something to do with deregulation, B: but I believe, uh, more of it was just greed. A: Yeah. A: I was talking to someone, A: I can't remember who it was, A: but he was a small businessman, A: and he said that the banks were calling, A: he borrowed some money A: and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away. A: They just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property A: and, uh, yeah, A: there, there should be thousands of people in jail as far as I'm concerned. B: Well, A: Not just a couple. B: You know, we've watched and watched T V and seen that a lot of these people were doing things, not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit, but financing the same property three and four times, you know, A: Right. B: and the list goes on and on. You know, of, of just the crimes committed. Much less for criminals that should be indicted. A: Well I, I agree a hundred percent. A: Oh, yeah. A: It may have started with HUD too. A: I noticed that HUD was in terrible shape A: and that was property A: and, uh, they lost a lot of money there, A: and then some of these big, these rich people started to, A: even Murchison here, who owned the Cowboys, had a lot of property down in Florida. A: This was several years ago A: and he lost, you know, all, all of his money before he died. B: Yeah. A: Not all of it, A: I don't know how much he lost, A: but, uh, they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit A: and it always would, it always would increase, you know, A: it always would, uh, uh, be more than what you paid for it A: and they just never even got conservative with our money at all. B: Yeah. B: It, B: everyone forgets whose money it was. A: Right. B: And, everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny American word. A: Yeah. B: I, B: as far as being a Republican or a Democrat, I think no American could stand for criminal action. A: Well now the reason that I said that is because I was going to blame all, uh, Reaganomics for, you know, A: you spend your way to prosperity A: and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls, I thought, well, that was the philosophy, you know. A: Just keep spending until taxes are lower, A: and, I thought, that's not going to work, you know, A: and I knew that it wasn't going to work originally. B: Well, A: And, it hasn't worked now. B: In theory, in theory, a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on. A: Right, A: no doubt, A: no doubt. B: And, if people are making money, people can spend money, B: and it'll generate taxes. A: Oh, yeah. A: I, I, I agree with that, A: but there's got to be some control A: and apparently there was, you know, B: Well, the problem is, B: and the problem with Reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich. A: Yeah. B: And, for what they would cost B: and we weren't producing anything. A: Yeah. B: We, as Americans weren't producing anything. B: It was all inflation. A: Yeah. B: And, I'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it, B: we agree too closely, B: but, But, you, you can't say that that was right. A: Yeah. A: I know, uh, A: Oh, no, A: I, B: No intelligent person can say that we could spend our way rich. A: Right. B: Remember all we're doing is delivering pizzas to each other. A: And, and not high quality ones at that, you know. B: Yeah. B: Well, A: Well, I do have a lot of confidence in the, the American people and the economy and everything else. A: I, I feel bad when I see the inefficiency, even here at T I, you know, A: and I think that the, A: it, it still, A: a lot of the workers don't understand that, uh, they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them, you know. B: It is a life and death struggle, with with the Japanese. A: Right. A: I know, A: and I, when I, A: of course I'm in facilities, A: and I work with a lot of mechanics A: and I just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce, you know, A: and they think that, well, I'm paid anyway A: so it doesn't matter, you know. B: I, I'm very tired of it all pays by the hour. A: Right. A: Right. B: Uh, and I'm nonexempt. A: Yeah, A: oh, really? A: You don't sound like a nonexempt, Jim. B: What? A: You don't sound like a nonexempt. B: What, what does a nonexempt sound like? A: Uh, you're too informed. A: They're, they're very, they're very, uh, not interested. A: They wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're talking about now. B: Uh, A: I guess I'm dealing with too many Texas mechanics here. A: I don't know really. B: Uh, that's, A: I'm being a Yankee, I guess I'm, I'm letting my Yankee come out, you know. B: Well, I, B: now maybe I'm not the, uh, typical nonexempt that you deal with. B: The badge is silver. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, I am degreed, though nonexempt. A: Uh, well that's good. B: No B: That's not good B: but, A: No, A: right, A: I mean, that's good that you're degreed, A: uh, uh, your time will come. A: We, uh, A: I know a few people, B: No, B: I, I do not wish my time to come. A: Oh, really, A: what, A: are you in a tech, A: like do you do technician work or something? B: Oh, no, B: no, B: no. B: I, B: government tool control is my specialty now. B: I did P C protection control work for, uh, About ten or twelve years, uh, A: Oh quality, okay. B: right now I'm just trying to tool crib and chips. A: Yeah. B: Times are bad. A: Oh, yeah. A: Well, now, is, is, uh, really terrible. A: I'm, uh, management level uh, facilities, A: and when the cuts came, three of us got, uh, bounced back, A: and so we're just, uh, A: I'm calling you from work. A: I'm, I'm covering, uh, weekends and nights now. A: I'm, I'm one of the manager reps, A: there's three of us to cover in Dallas facilities A: and just we're essentially standby and problems, uh, all, all nights and weekends. A: That's my, A: I only get one weekend off a month right now. A: I call it my recession job. B: It's, A: Uh, being basically an engineer and liking, uh, doing installation work, well there's not any. A: I mean there is literally is no installation work going on. B: They turned all installation up here off. A: Yeah. B: They told facilities they could not work. A: Yeah. B: I don't care what the jobs are, you will not work. A: Yeah, A: it, it, B: And, and, as far as our, you know, our conversation goes, I would really be interested to know how much of T I's problems now are related to, the banking structure. A: Banking? A: I think that, not, not only T I, but a lot of it, when they talk about, uh, A: there was one point I was going to make. A: I think the last I heard, A: and I, I have to admit I'm not as informed as them, A: but there's something like about eighty six billion that they admit. A: Well, I always double that. A: I figure well, if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty-six billion, it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes A: and so if that's true, it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was, that went down the tube somewhere. B: Uh, it really hurts me, to realize that a lot of people out there are trying to retire on their home values. A: Yeah. A: It's amazing really. A: It's amazing that, A: Oh, yeah. A: I know what you mean. B: Uh, one of our senior, A: Course your value of homes up there are pretty good. A: I mean, here they're not really that high, A: but are they pretty good up there? B: No. A: Oh, really. B: Our economy in Colorado Springs fell completely apart. A: Well we're in the metroplex here, you know, A: and, uh, it, it, B: Right. A: I die every time companies like General Dynamics, A: they, they lost several contracts A: and, and, I don't know if you noticed yesterday, you probably don't pay attention to the Bell Helicopter, you know, A: they were going to have big, uh, award, A: and Secorski got it. Which was Boeing Secorski, this which is up in the north somewhere, you know. B: Yeah, B: it's northwest. A: And, I don't know how, Bell didn't get it. B: Seattle. B: Seattle, B: and also, uh, they do some of that in Wichita, Kansas. A: Well, I, I don't, A: they were advertising here that it was Bell, T I. A: T I was getting the, uh, electronics with Bell, A: and so, it was a double. A: One that Bell is in the Metroplex A: and two, that T I was doing the electronics for them. B: Huh. A: And, they, they advertised that, that it was T I Bell, T I Bell and then all of a sudden, Secorski got it, yeah. B: Secorski Boeing. A: Secorski, Boeing, A: Boeing doesn't need the money. A: Something, A: I almost think there's some politics around here, because the metroplex here, in the Dallas, Fort Worth area, the, uh, with T I, A: I don't know if T I has lost as much as everybody else, A: but General Dynamics and L T V and Bell have lost project after project, you know. B: Well, you realize ... B: There you go. A: Uh-huh. B: Well, Jean, the subject is jury trials B: and should the jury recommend, uh, sentencing. A: Uh-huh. B: Now my personal opinion, B: I don't know. B: Uh, uh, here lately it seems, B: well up until a few years ago, I guess, there just too many liberals about and permitting too many, oh, B: they just broaden the human rights to, to cover just about everybody, and I don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole. A: Uh-huh. B: It's just not right. A: I think I agree with that very much. B: And therefore I think juries should be able to recommend sentencing. A: I, A: do you, A: Do you think a lot of people, when they are listening to a trial, put themselves in a position like that and say, I would never do something like that, A: and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done? B: Yes, B: very possibly. B: So many of us have led sheltered lives that, uh, when we go into a, sit in on, a jury, A: Uh-huh. B: I've never done it myself unfortunately, A: I never have either. B: I wish I could have. B: I've just never been called up. A: My husband works as a police man, A: so I always assumed that that was why I was never called. B: Well now, that's possible. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, I was called up as an alternate once, B: but I never made it to the jury. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh, do they have such a thing now as a six man jury? B: Not that I know of. A: Somebody told me the other day that there is, what they call a six man jury, A: and I had never heard of such thing, A: and I wondered if it was true. B: Uh-huh B: Uh, I've never heard of it. A: I never had either, A: but I just wondered. Uh, A: another question was, should a criminal case, should the jury be unanimous on their decision, A: and that I wasn't sure on either, whether it should be unanimous or not. B: Uh, well, there again, uh, I suppose it should be. A: That would mean they all would have to decide one way or the other. B: Exactly. B: Is it guilt or innocence. B: But then again, so many times you get one or two holdouts, B: and, and it permits the criminal to get a retrial. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: And there, B: that's not too bad in this sense, because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, that's happened and giving them another trial might give them additional time to, uh, prove their innocence. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Bring some of these things out. B: Yes. A: Uh-huh. B: We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials. A: Un, apparently there are. A: I, I, I, A: since my husband worked as a policeman, I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have, are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: I have, I still have a little bit of a problem with that. A: Uh, but, I would suppose there are circumstances, you're in the wrong place at the right time, or know the wrong person at the right time. B: Oh, that's it, B: and you just might resemble somebody. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, out here in Texas we had a, a, a, great miscarriage of justice. B: It was finally, after nine years, it was finally, uh, taken care of. A: Uh-huh. B: We had, B: a Black man was accused simply because he resembled uh, someone who who held up, a, Seven Eleven, I think it was. A: Oh. Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: And even though he had witnesses that said that, uh, he was at work, B: and he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not, A: They still found him guilty? B: They found him guilty. A: When people said he was at work? B: Well, they said it this, this happened during lunch time. A: Uh-huh. B: And he could have gotten away at lunch time and committed the robbery. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: But after nine years, B: well as a matter of fact they made a T V show about it, after nine years, they finally came up with evidence and proved, to prove that he was innocent. A: Oh, for heaven's sake. A: So there's nine years of that man's life gone. B: Exactly. A: Uh-huh. B: Now that just was not fair. A: No, A: huh-uh. B: So. A: Yeah, A: I guess that's where a lot of the problem lies, A: we're, we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people, the one's that are on trial. B: Yes. A: And, And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to, because I bet, they still say our system is the best in the world. B: Unfortunately, that's what happens. B: Well, it's not, the, uh, uh, it's not the best system, B: but it's the best one in the world. A: Yeah, A: it's the best one that exists, I guess. B: Uh-huh. B: And unfortunately, we just have to put up with a lot of things, B: and they try to solve them and everything, B: but, uh, I don't know, B: the Supreme Court, B: well, I'm, I'm, I'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag. A: Oh, I think a lot of people are. A: I think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country. B: Well, it, B: the, the, the First Amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, uh, well that just rancles me B: no, B: I swear, if I ever saw somebody to, uh, burning a flag, I'd, I'd try to kill them, I would. A: That bad, huh. A: I wouldn't like it, A: but I don't know if I'd go that far. B: Well, I happen to be a flag freak. B: I served, I was in the service A: Uh-huh. B: I was in Korea A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, well, I saw what the red in the flag represents. A: Yeah, A: well, I think pride in our country and our flag is so important. A: It's important in so many facets of our lives. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, I, I feel like if they don't, people don't like what our flag stands for, they're welcome to go some place else. B: Yeah, B: see what they, A: There's nobody holding them here. B: See how they'd like it under another flag. A: Right. A: They'd soon be back, A: I'm sure. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Well, Jean, we seem to be of the same opinions here. A: Uh-huh. B: I hope they get something out of this. A: Yeah, A: I don't know about the judge making the decision, if that's, A: do you think that's good you know, like if a jury, B: Oh A: Uh-huh. B: but I think the jury should be able to recommend, A: Make a recommendation? B: Yes. A: Do they sometimes make a recommendation? B: Oh, yes, B: yes. A: That's what I was thinking they, they sometimes do. B: I don't know if that's a regular procedure or what. B: But I know I'm always hearing that, uh, B: well, the jury came in with a guilty verdict B: and they recommended, twenty years or something. A: And they recommend. A: Yeah. A: And then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen. Yeah. B: Yes. B: Of course, now, the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence. A: Uh-huh. B: They may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five. A: Well, I think that's where a lot of people think, boy they're getting put away for a long time, A: but actually, their chance, course, when, A: a lot of times when they come up for parole, they're denied. A: It depends on you know, what they're, what they'd been guilty of, and a lot of different things, I guess. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: but too many times they, they are permitted to go out on parole B: and, A: Uh-huh. A: A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do. A: And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again. B: Yes. B: They just go out and repeat their crimes. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: Well there, B: well, they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison, B: but I think they ought to make it two offenses. A: Uh-huh. A: I always thought there was, there was wrong, A: it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody. B: Uh-huh. A: It seemed like there, sometimes there's not a good, A: the balance isn't right. A: It doesn't make sense. B: Yeah, B: very true. B: Well, here again now, there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently. A: Uh-huh. B: Race or nationality even. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. B: But, uh, like you said, it's, it's not the best system, B: but it's the best one we've got. A: Yeah, A: right. A: So, let's put up with it, I guess. B: Uh-huh. A: Improve it if we can, if we ever get a chance. B: Sure enough. A: So. B: Jean, it's been awful nice talking to you. A: Well, it's been nice talking to you, Jack, A: and I hope you have a real good day and week. B: Well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing. A: I hope not. B: Take care now. A: You, too. B: Bye. A: Bye-bye. A: Okay. A: Where, where are you from? B: Um, just here in Dallas. A: Oh, okay B: Uh-huh. A: because I, uh, I talked to a professor in, uh, what was it, North Carolina, who got the, the T I system, A: and he gave to all his students. A: So, my daughter's even talked to, A: and I've talked to several people from North Carolina. A: I was just curious. B: That's, B: yes, B: yes, B: that's true. B: I've talked, A: Have you, too? B: Uh-huh. B: People from Virginia and, and all over. Yeah. A: Yeah. A: I talked to the professor, A: and I asked him about it, A: and he said, Oh, he says, I think I'm the guy that, actually, uh, gave it to all my students. A: So that's why so many people are from this college. A: Go, ahead, B: Uh-huh. A: you, you first, Eve . B: Oh, okay. B: Um, well the subject we're supposed to be talking about, let's see, is, uh, food. A: Food. B: What type of foods do you cook B: and what would you, uh, cook in, uh, uh, let's see, if you were giving a dinner party? B: And the only reason why I may know a little bit about this, is that I'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon. A: Oh, great. B: And to me, that's the type of thing that I like to give in, um, uh, cooking for people. B: And, uh, if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and, uh, you don't have to do all that much work. You know, you just, uh, slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce and away you go. A: Yeah. A: We have them too, A: and I, I'm trying to think which is the, best, uh, that I prefer. A: Uh, my wife, uh, doesn't like to have all that work on the very day that you're doing it, uh, A: and we haven't catered out very much, uh, A: we, I always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be, A: the man always gets that chore, A: and you, have to make it perfect. A: Uh, I've made shish kabob, which I like. A: It's fairly easy and fast. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, A: I guess I'm thinking of the easy thing to do for, for having, uh, uh, dinner. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: I do cook, A: but not, A: I'm mostly the easy cooker. A: You know, the breakfasts and, and the steaks, uh. B: Yes. A: Although I would like to experiment with, uh, the meals my mother made, you know. So to speak, B: Uh-huh. A: and I haven't gotten around to that yet, uh, B: What kind of meals did she make that you liked? A: Well, she was Polish A: and, uh, she would make very economical meals. A: We were very poor. B: Uh-huh. A: Different rice and ham and things that, uh, A: she would throw things together and galunkies and all that. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, I would like to try that one day. A: And she would make spaghetti with pork chops and, and special meat balls and everything. A: And my wife, of course, thinks I'm crazy, which I may be too B: Huh. A: but, B: No. B: Sounds interesting, uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: that's great. A: But dinner parties are a lot of work, uh, B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: But, uh, that's, that's why I like the, the outdoor stuff a, a lot better. A: Yeah. B: People can entertain themselves, I think, a great deal more, uh, when you have a barbecue. Especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and, uh, you know, nothing really fancy, like your, your shish kabobs, where you have to do a whole bunch of work. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Well, that, that, A: shish kabob is, uh, just because it only takes a few minutes to cook, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: you get it ready, A: you have to do a lot of work beforehand, I agree, and buy special stuff. A: But, uh, so far as getting out there and, and putting it on, it only takes a a few minutes, uh. B: Right. A: But anyway, I'm, I'm thinking of the easy way, rather than, my guests, I guess, A: but, uh, B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Well, I, I think you do, do a lot of work. B: Even if people do bring over things, you still do, uh, all the, uh, housework and get everything prepared and utensils and just, just everything. A: Right. A: Right. B: Uh, you know, my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. B: I'm thinking about, uh, special dishes, B: and, uh, yeah, B: it was made out of rice and consume soup, uh, and bacon and onions. A: Oh, yeah. B: And then you'd simmer it like all day long. A: Right. B: Oh it would, A: You'd get the odor of it, yeah. B: Yeah. B: And it was just, it was just wonderful. B: That's, that's something that I would really like to, uh, to try and find the recipe for. B: But we used to have that at Thanksgiving time. Because you can, you can put it on top of the stove, and do this, A: Uh-huh, A: yes. B: and, and there's so much broth and juice in there, that it has to, uh, soak up into the rice, all day long, in order for it to, uh, uh, to come out fluffy and, and nice. A: Oh, great. B: And that was, you know, B: when you were talking about the, the Polish dishes, uh, some goulashes and things like that. B: That's, uh, that's what I thought about, was that Armenian rice dish. A: Oh, yes, A: we probably ought to try this. A: But it probably will never taste as good as we remembered. A: I guess it gets better and better as we remember it, back, as we get older, you know. B: That's true. A: But we probably should try it, uh, to do that. B: That's true. A: The recipes are really interesting, you know. A: We're probably going to lose them A: and we'll probably forget all about them, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: Since we're trying to make everything so A: here I am talk about trying to make everything easy, you know. B: Right, B: right. A: I, uh, A: you talked about Thanksgiving, there are interesting meals at different times. A: Uh, something, A: my wife's from Texas, A: so, uh, I remember we were first married A: and we were living in New Jersey. A: And, uh, we were going over to my mother's house for Christmas, you know, to have a meal. B: Uh-huh. A: And we were on the way over, A: we were just married that very year, A: and she said, Oh, I'm looking forward to a nice turkey. A: I said, Turkey? A: I said, We don't have turkey at Christmas B: Oh. A: I said, We only have turkey on Thanksgiving. A: I said, We're going to have a ham. B: Uh-huh. A: She said, What? B: Yeah! A: I said, Yeah. A: I said, No, turkey is only for Thanksgiving. A: And because she had turkey a lot, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, that was surprising in the, in the east, uh, A: we always had ham, you know. B: Right, B: right. A: and, and that's one thing A: that's another recipe, I guess, we could talk about. A: Now the hams just kind of, you know, go take it out of a can or, uh, uh, a package, sliced, uh, A: the cans were cooked for hours and hours and, and were just wonderful, you know. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: I, I'd like to try that too. B: Yeah. B: You know what I found was, at Sam's, uh, Wholesale uh, stores. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, what they have is this honey baked ham, A: Oh, yeah, A: I saw them. B: They, A: That's good. B: have you seen, have you had any of those? A: No, A: I, I, uh, I've, I know about Sam's. A: My wife I think goes A: but, B: If, if you ever get a chance to buy one of those, I think it was, uh, twenty dollars, for, uh, I don't remember how many pounds it was. A: Uh-huh. B: But you cook it in the bag that they send it in. A: Oh, really? B: And all the juices and everything are all sealed in. B: And, I tell you what, it's never failed to come out tender and juicy, and just and just delicious. Because I normally don't like ham, because it's so salty. A: Oh, I haven't heard of that, yeah. A: Yeah. B: But with this honey bake that they have, that, that's the only one I have been able to find there at Sam's warehouse. B: It is absolutely delicious. A: Oh, yeah. B: And it slices great. Uh-huh. A: I'm trying to think of his name of it. A: Uh, uh, I don't know, uh. A: I see a can here, or a box here of Gourmet Choice. A: Uh, he delivers, uh. A: What is the name of this thing? A: I got a box, distributor, marked on it, A: it doesn't say, Gourmet Choices. A: But he, A: but it's a company that has, uh, you know, a truck that comes around. A: And, and they recently had hams. A: They have steaks and, and, uh, actually, pirogies and all that stuff that, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: I, I wish I could tell you the name of the company, A: but I don't know what it is. A: But, uh, they recently had a ham, that was supposed to be, A: it was boneless B: Yeah. A: and we tried it. A: It was real nice, A: and it was fully cooked and everything. A: We had it for breakfast a long time. B: Uh-huh. A: It was really great. B: Wow! B: You know, that sounds like it. A: Yeah. B: But that's, that's the only ham I have found that I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoy. A: I would like to try the old recipe though, of cooking it, A: and, and I keep saying this, uh, to, to do the different things that we did. A: But I would like to put one in the oven, you know, the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours, and see if, A: because I don't think in, in my married life, which is, uh, twenty-six years now, we've never done that, you know. B: Wow. A: And I remember that when I was a kid, uh, to have the ham cooking. Uh, rather than that, we just, B: Uh-huh. A: ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally, you know. B: Right A: And that's it, you know. A: In the old days, we had, hams were the meal, A: and I don't, I don't think we, really have it as a main meal. B: Right. B: That's true. B: I, I don't think so anymore, not with more, becoming more conscious of, uh, fat and cholesterol and, and all those good things. A: Right. A: That's an interesting point. A: How, how have you changed your, your meals now? A: Have you, A: into that, uh, B: Oh, yeah. A: looking at those things? B: Well, my parents actually started it, A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, getting, A: Parents, that's unusual. B: Well, it, it's true. B: I think my parents are very unusual because, uh, we grew up in the south, where, uh, you have all the, uh, you know, biscuits and gravy and, oh, fried foods galore. A: Oh, yeah. B: And then gradually they started switching over to, uh, plain rice, uh, no gravy. A: That's amazing. B: It's just, it really is. B: They, uh, they're actually, they actually, uh, uh, led us through it, versus, uh, us teaching them, you know, the, uh, the finer points. B: But my mother has really high cholesterol, B: so it was one of the reasons which started them off. A: Yeah. B: And they started doing this, like in the early, or in about the middle seventies. A: Well, that's amazing, B: Uh, yeah. A: they'd go, A: that they have started. A: Usually it's the younger people doing it. A: Yeah. B: It's true, B: it's true. B: I agree with you. A: I, A: uh, my, my wife's mother is the only grandparent left, B: So, it's really neat. A: and, uh, she has high cholesterol. B: Uh-huh. A: Of course, I I have too, but not like hers. B: Uh-huh. A: And I always get after her about salt and everything else. A: And she just will, I mean, she's going to eat the same way she ate, you know, her whole life. B: That's right. A: And she just tells, more or less tells me to shut up, you know. B: Right A: And, uh, I like to, A: I'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, B: Uh-huh. A: uh, it's, it's not the A: . I listen to, uh, Larry Newarth on the weekend. A: He's a fitness expert A: and, uh, he talks about, you know, the chicken and the rice and everything else. B: Uh-huh. A: And, and, uh, throwing away peanut butter and all the things you know, the things not to eat, you know, ever. A: I think the peanut butter and mayonnaise he would throw away for ever. A: And then he's got me into making eggs without the yolk. B: Wow! A: You know, try that sometime. B: Uh-huh. A: My wife says she can't stand it. A: But, uh, when I make scrambled eggs now, talking about a recipe, B: Uh-huh. A: I, A: say if I have four eggs, not, not for me, A: but if I'm making four eggs, uh, even for my daughter and I, I'll take out all the yolks but one. B: Wow! A: And and it's fine. A: You, you don't miss it, uh. B: Huh. A: In fact, when I, when I make eggs for myself, if I, if I fry them, throw them in there, I will almost hard fry them so I can take, not eat the yolk at all. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: And you don't really miss it. A: You get the flavor of the yolk, A: but, uh you don't eat it at all, you know. A: You don't, A: they're hard. A: You get like, uh, a bite at, at the most. B: Uh-huh. A: And so, uh, for cholesterol, I mean, I'm trying that. A: And it has worked. A: My cholesterol gone down twenty points. A: So, although, B: Wow, that's good. A: I haven't gotten on the, which, whether butter or not cholesterol, margarine and all that. A: I don't know, know, whether any of that is true, you know Whether the margarines or butter, B: Uh-huh. A: Okay. B: Okay. B: What can we do about crime? B: I don't know. B: The one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're, they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people B: and they keep letting out people that have, you know, these horrible records. A: Uh-huh. B: So maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something. B: That's one thing I guess I could think of A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, it's definitely a big concern, B: I mean every day it's, you know, all B: we live in a little small town, B: and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time. B: And you just can't get away from it no matter where you live. A: Yeah. A: Well I, B: So it's pretty scary. A: I'm, I'm from Butler, A: and I can't say that there's too much of that there. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, I know the bigger cities have problems with it. B: Yeah. A: Uh, I really don't know what we can do about it. B: Yeah. A: Unless they start enforcing the, uh, B: It's rough, because A: like: t, t, t, t, uh, start giving more people death sentences. A: That's the only thing I can think of. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous. B: I mean you hear about people, you know, six and seven times have committed burglaries B: and they're still, you know, only serving six months in prison. B: So that's definitely something. B: They could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like, you know, from one month to ten years or something A: Uh-huh. B: That would be one thing that, you know, I think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties, you know, for certain crimes A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: I, I, uh, I don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse. B: Yeah. B: And one things that they're saying, now, B: are you going, B: are you a student B: or are you in the work force B: or, A: Um, I'm a senior at Clarion University. B: Oh, okay. B: Because one of the things that I've heard so much about um, lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much. B: And apparently many of the, especially like in date rape, many of the, uh, you know, perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up. A: Well, not only that, a lot of them's not even turned in. B: And they don't really, A: You know, what I mean? B: Wow. A: A lot of times the girls don't even report it. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: Um, I've heard of a few case up here, A: but I can't say that I've heard of, uh, you know, any significant amount. B: Yeah. A: Uh, but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not. B: Yeah. B: They say like only one in ten are reported. B: I believe it. A: Uh-huh. B: That's awful. B: So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it. B: I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing. B: But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, you know, for people to report it. A: Uh-huh. B: So that's probably something else they could do. A: Yeah. B: I don't know, B: it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs, you know. B: And that's like as long as, B: it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, you know, B: because these kids are saying why should I go to high school B: and so I can go out and work at Burger King, you know, for four dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs. B: So that's certainly a big problem. B: I don't know what the solution to that is. B: Having more drug treatment centers available. B: Jeez, I don't know. A: Uh. See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything. B: Yeah. A: I know a lot of people that partake in that. A: And I'm not saying they're bad people, A: but I, I, I would say that's a bigger problem. B: Yeah. B: Because it ends up, B: even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, you know, B: huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, you know, on higher and higher up, on drugs, A: Uh-huh. B: and it's definitely got to do with crime. B: You know, you hear about people selling their babies, you know, to get some crack. B: I mean, just, oh, B: gosh, horrible stuff like that. B: One of the things they're doing is, is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack. A: Uh-huh. B: They said, uh, some of the statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack, B: and their moms are crack users. B: So that's, you know, another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal, you know, for doing that to her child. A: Uh-huh. B: So I don't know who's the victim there. B: I mean the kids are the victim, it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted. B: And, it's a very complicated problem. B: I don't envy the government trying to cope with it. Gosh. A: No, I don't either. B: Yeah. B: Well, I guess that's about all I have to say. A: Uh, B: Is there anything else you would want to, A: No. B: Okay. A: I can't say that I, I just know that it's really bad in some areas A: and something's going to have to be done sooner A: but, B: Yeah. A: I don't, I don't know what they can do. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: It's frustrating. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, B: Okay. B: Well, thanks for talking. A: It was nice talking to you. B: Have a good day. A: You too. A: Bye. B: Bye, bye. B: Uh, basically I'm at home B: and I have two cats and my husband, A: Uh-huh. B: I mean my husband's great. A: Oh, uh-huh. B: It's wonderful, you know, A: Yeah. B: and, and, uh, so I'm about forty and whatever, A: Uh-huh A: Around there, huh. B: So, yeah. A: Well, you're, you're just a youngster then B: Yeah, B: I'm just a spring chicken, I guess A: I passed the fifty. A: So, I guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's roles, A: so it should be real interesting. B: Well, B: Righto A: So, you think we're ready? B: I think I'm ready A: Okay A: okay. A: Uh, you want to start off? B: Well, let's see, B: the changes I've seen in women's roles, uh, B: since I am in the forty age, I'm a fifties baby uh, A: Uh-huh. B: and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very, very wide, uh, it's been a big change. A: Very much, yeah, A: yeah. B: Very much, B: and I think you'll have to agree B: and and since we were in, uh, sort of the ground level, the bra burning of the sixties, A: Yes. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: and, and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be uh, A: Uh-huh. B: and I think, you know, it got off to a really radical, B: it has a radical fringe to it that, uh, I've sort of backed away from. A: I think all things get started sometimes in that manner. B: Yeah. A: You know, they come in that way. B: And, to make a change, you know, you have to make a splash. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: But, to continue in that vein, I think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas, A: Uh-huh. B: but I really do think that women have made a contribution uh, to human beings, I mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions A: Uh-huh. B: and it's okay B: and I think, uh, you know on the other hand, I don't know that men have changed that much. B: So in, in contrast to the women's changes, uh, you know, the men stay steady, A: Uh-huh. B: and then the women change around them. A: I hadn't thought much about that, A: but that is true. A: That, B: Uh, I think men are trying. A: Uh-huh. A: Some of them. B: But they don't have a national organization of men, to, uh, help them out A: No. B: and uh, what's changing them, though, is the economic situation, where both team, it has to be a team partnership now, A: Very much. A: Uh-huh. B: and they both have to work A: Uh-huh. B: and they both have to raise the children, if we're going to have any kind of future at all, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and, and that, I think has been the downfall of the last ten years. A: Uh-huh. B: You know, the me, oh, B: I don't know, B: the, the yuppiedom, the whatever it was, the, you know, women didn't know how to go about doing the careers A: Uh-huh. B: and they wanted to compete with men, B: they wanted to be like men, A: Uh-huh. B: and that's wrong. A: Yeah. B: I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men, men A: Not, A: no, A: they, they hurt themselves a little bit in that way. B: Absolutely, B: and so that's, you know, B: they sort of threw the thing back another, you know, ten years, that they've had to, you know, restructure, A: Uh-huh. B: but I saw the greatest T-shirt the other day, B: I got to get some for all my men friends, B: it says, let men run the world, women have more important things to do A: There you go A: There's a lot of truth in that. B: Right. A: Yeah. B: But, uh, I think men and women both have valuable, valuable assets to offer A: Uh-huh. B: and, you know, we shouldn't, B: we were made differently, however you come to that conclusion, B: we were biologically, physiologically, made differently B: uh, uh, A: do you have any special interest in, uh, space flight? B: Oh yeah. B: Ever since I was a young and, uh, used to watch the old, uh, Apollo missions going off in, uh, classroom T V A: Uh-huh B: Uh, I suspect a lot of people, uh, uh, got, uh, turned on by watching, watching those go off. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, very exciting. A: Yeah. B: The, uh, uh, B: I've I've always, uh, wanted very much, uh, to, uh, be somehow involved in all that. And, uh, to, uh, meet and, and to see, see it actually happen. A: Uh-huh. B: Of course, I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, that seems rather unlikely at this point, unfortunately. A: What do you do now? B: Uh, computer programmer A: Oh. B: Unfortunately, that can be done from the ground A: Yeah. A: To bad, huh. *spelling: too B: Yeah. B: Made the wrong, wrong career choice to get up into space B: The, uh, uh, B: I used to think when I was, when I was younger that, uh, by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: Uh, frustrating at times. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't know what you think about all that. A: Well, uh, I, uh, I'm kind of young. A: I'm only twenty-two A: and so, uh, uh, I'm not, you know, A: there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as, uh, you know, with the space shuttle and all. Although plans to, uh, go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to, uh, the sixties. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, although I have a and whatnot, B: Yeah. Yeah. A: it would be great if we could find some way to, to, uh, use that to boost the economy. B: Well, the, uh, uh, B: I've always, uh, felt that, uh, uh, one of the long-term solutions that, at least a few of our problems would be to have, uh, some sort of, uh, solar power satellites up. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, because that's a, uh, you know, in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it, that doesn't require, uh, uh, any particularly nasty environment impact. A: Exactly. B: And you can just get as much power as you need up there. A: Uh-huh. B: It's just a matter of how big you build it. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, and, of course, the side effects of this is that you have to have, uh, lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing. B: So the side effects of doing that which I think would be good, you know, very, very good for for everyone in the long run is, uh, is it, some of the other things I'd like to see happen would happen also, B: so I'm, A: Right. A: Yeah. A: It seems like, uh, there's, A: so you're talking about positive side effects then. B: Yeah, B: right. A: Okay, A: I understand. B: Right. Right. A: Sure, A: that makes a lot of sense. B: The only problem is, of course, that, uh, that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: And they want to do the research B: and uh, they're all you know, A: Yeah. B: the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like, uh, the trip to Mars. Which is, would, would produce some useful scientific research and so forth, A: Right, A: exactly. B: but the same money could probably be far better spent on, uh, uh, lunar bases and solar power satellite research and, you know, so forth. A: Uh-huh. B: It, it would it would be being done for the, uh, glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of, instead of for, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: we should eventually send someone, people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so. A: Right. B: We should do it because, for, for the return we get for it. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, unfortunately, that's not what I thinks happened *listen A: Exactly. A: Least not, B: I, I would settle for the for the glitz if the side effects were useful, like the, uh, B: but, uh A: Yeah. B: the downside of that is you, after you do one of those, people say well we did it. A: Right. B: Now let's now we're done A: Now we're done. B: No need to use this to play around with this space stuff anymore. B: That's what happened with Apollo. But, uh, I'd give almost anything to get into space *sd A: Yeah. A: I think you're right. A: I would too. A: I'd, I'd, uh, A: was it John Denver that that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle? A: I guess, I guess by what you said you're, you don't feel your, uh, privacy has been invaded anytime recently? B: No, B: not really. B: Uh, uh, the only thing that annoys me is when, uh, people call and they, uh, you have solicitation calls. A: Uh-huh. B: That's the only thing that bothers me. B: That's not really invading my privacy A: Right. B: Uh, do you feel that yours is invaded? A: Uh, no A: I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means. A: Uh, you know, I would, A: there, there's a lot of times though, uh, you get those calls and, you know, when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or, or whatnot A: and, you know, next thing you know, uh, someone calls and wants to sell you this or that A: and it's real hard to, to tell them, you know, that you're not interested. A: Or you do tell them you're not interested A: and they still keep asking you, you know, and keep badgering you about it, A: and that aggravates me. A: But I don't know that you could call that invading of, invading my privacy A: because, you know, if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say, look, you know, I want my name unlisted or want my, you know, B: But, but that doesn't work. A: It doesn't? B: Uh, no, B: because they, a lot of times they dial sequentially. B: They get your name from, uh, if you enter any type of contest or anything. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, you know, you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something, B: you put your phone number on there, B: they pass your phone number on to another company. A: Oh. B: Uh, or you, uh, B: or, or like the newspapers, they just dial randomly or and stuff. B: They even call, the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe B: And, uh, while I was subscribing to the paper, I got so upset at them that they A: Uh-huh. B: you call me one more time, I'm going to stop subscribing B: And the local, local papers ask them to remove your number from their list B: and, uh, yeah, B: you call up their regular, during regular hours B: their, uh, they have a special department, B: they'll take your numbers out of their lists. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, but the, uh, Orlando paper, uh, yeah, they, they refused to take it off of the lists B: and they call every month. A: Huh. B: And when you have more than one phone number, you get a call on each number you have A: Good grief. A: Well, let me ask you about this. A: Here's something that, uh, has been kind of concerning me lately. A: My fiance received a bill from a, a Lord and Taylor company, A: Uh, you know, they're a, they're a department store. B: Uh-huh. A: She received a bill from them, uh, that she had visited some A: and, and I think it was there in Florida, A: maybe it was in Miami. A: That, uh, she had visited a store there A: and, uh, they had this bill, uh, that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise, uh, over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, and the date that, that she supposedly made this purchase, she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, and, and I've, I've heard recently that, uh, uh, that this is a common occurrence where people are using you know, A: they use Joe Blow's uh, social security number, uh, and can, uh, potentially ruin someone's credit. B: Uh-huh. B: If you know a person's social security number and their mailing address, and their mother's maiden name uh, you can, basically, become that, uh, person. A: Huh. B: Uh, if the purchase was made mail order, they should have a record of where it was shipped to A: Uh-huh. B: and since it wasn't shipped to her address, she could prove, you know, that it wasn't her. B: Uh, if it was some you know, coming into the store and stuff, then she would whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of, uh, you know, document A: Yeah. B: and, uh, B: the signature, uh, B: they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature B: and if they can't provide a signature, you know, they'll have to eat the charge A: Yeah. A: Well, B: But if the has, you know, their social her social security number, I'd be real concerned that they, uh, that she's not, uh, blacklist on, uh, what is it, it's Telecredit or something? A: Yeah. B: Uh, because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there. B: She probably won't be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle. A: Yeah. A: Well, we got it cleared up eventually. A: What happened, uh, A: Have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list A: and their either offering a service A: or they're introducing some new product in the area A: and normally when they call, you're either in the shower, A: or you're in the middle of cooking something A: and you have to stop everything to run to the phone. B: Yes, B: yes. B: Is, is that one that you're talking about. A: That was the big one I'm talking about. A: I work weird hours, A: and invariably just about the time, I'm going to sleep, the phone tears off the wall. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: And you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone, A: you either hear, the as soon as you say hello, you hear the click of the recording coming on, B: Uh-huh. A: or you hear somebody all ready starting, reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already. B: That's true, B: or the ones that are, are generated by a computer. B: It's just a computer voice that comes on the line. B: Those are the ones that I really, really hate too. A: I've even had some of them, A: the, they're voice activated A: and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: sometimes I, I get them on my, uh, answering machine at home B: so, and I hate that when I've got a whole bunch of messages B: and I go through them B: and most of them aren't from anybody at all. A: What I would love to see done to stop all of this, B: Uh-huh. A: we've got a thing in this country, A: you can have your phone number unlisted, B: Uh-huh. A: and I think a law should be passed to where any of these people, A: I think it's great, that you know, freedom of speech in this country and everything, A: but if they're going to offer these services, or these recorded message, everything, they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them. B: Uh-huh, B: yes, B: see I have an unlisted telephone number, B: but I still get all of those calls B: and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I don't even understand. B: So, yeah, B: I do, B: I really feel that's, uh, an invasion of my privacy. B: I agree with you on that particular subject there. B: Let me see. A: That's about, that as far as any other everyday occurrences, A: I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door, either religious groups, or people peddling products. A: If I wanted their products, I would have either gone to the store to bought it, A: or I would have called for their salesman to come out. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: that's true. B: Living in an apartment complex though, you know you can't, um, you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations, uh, B: but they still come up to the front door and, uh, you know, walk around. B: So, usually what I do is I'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey, there's people coming around, you know, B: and they're trying to sell something B: or, or they're from a religious organization B: and I really hate that. B: I really, really do. B: I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago B: and, uh, gosh it was about nine o'clock at night, too. B: It wasn't even what I would consider, you know, family hours, B: time to, you know, start going to bed B: and uh, and it was somebody from, um, oh what was it, the, uh, Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, B: and uh, I've read a lot about, uh, that particular sect B: and I don't particularly care for it, B: so I especially don't like for them to come up to my door and, and try and talk to me. A: Now, I agree with their right to, uh, pursue their religion of choice, in that, whatever manner they want to, A: but I think they should also respect the sanctity of the American home, whether it be in a house or in an apartment. A: I'm on my turf, A: if I want them there, I'll call for them, A: otherwise, I don't want to know they exist. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: no, B: I, I agree with you there. B: If they want to choose that particular religion that's fine with me too, you know, as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in. B: And, and I don't like the way that they do it either, B: and, and, it's their mission that they do it. B: They go door to door B: and they go out into the public B: and they actually have the, uh, teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work B: and, uh, I don't know, B: I just, um, don't particularly care for that at all. B: And that, that's one thing that I feel really strongly about though, is, uh, you know, people coming up to my door, and especially religious organizations and wanting to uh, you know, to try and get me to join or, you know, become interested in their religion, B: because I have my own. A: Now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting, A: I've even gone so far as to put that, A: I've got a storm door on the front of the house A: and I've put, in, A: I don't know how much clearer it can be, A: it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting. A: I should have, I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise, cause I still get, B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: that's true, B: yeah. B: No B: I don't, uh, I don't have, I didn't go that far B: but, uh, yeah B: I probably could do the same thing, uh, you know, B: I don't have a storm door, B: but I'm sure I could rig up something. B: But you know I don't think that that would stop people. B: I, it's like they see that word B: and it says go instead of stop. B: Oh, goodness. A: and then reverse it, A: and do, A: well that would be technically illegal, A: it would be harassment. B: Oh gosh. A: But, I consider an invasion of my privacy, a harassment in itself. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: yeah, B: that's true, B: that's true, um. B: Well what else? A: I believe we've pretty much summed everything up. B: I know, B: but I remember you, you talked about something, B: you started off and said, B: well let me think, B: you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door. B: You said something else. B: I can't remember what it was, B: and I thought yeah, B: that, that kind of touched a nerve right there, B: but we got uh, we got to talking about the, uh, uh, people coming to you at the front door. A: I'm drawing a blank. B: Oh goodness, B: okay, B: is our five minutes up? A: Uh, pretty close to it. B: Pretty close. A: Well I've enjoyed talking with you. B: Well it was nice talking to you too Jim. A: And take it easy now. B: Okay, B: thanks, B: bye. A: Good night. A: Okay, A: so we've got to talk about music. B: Okay. Well, no that's really when I grew up, A: And, um, do you like classic rock, or modern rock, or which kind? A: No, A: not a seventies baby. B: so that's really what I like better, B: is that kind of music B: I mean, A: Is it disco, A: or is it like, B: No, B: no, B: no, B: not that kind of music A: but, B: No, B: more like, uh, rock, um, you know, like Led Zepplin type A: Oh, okay. A: So, so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin. B: Right. A: Yeah, A: that's cool. B: Right. A: And, how about the Rolling Stones? B: Oh, sure, B: sure B: I went to their concert last year when they were here. A: Oh, that's when, that's when they took, toured. A: How about, um, Pink Floyd? B: Sure, B: yeah, B: I like them. A: Okay. A: So, so then we got, we got some same things A: because, B: Okay, B: well, I just didn't know that much about music B: and I wasn't sure what kind of music. A: No, A: it's very hard A: because, see, well, I mean, in the whole spectrum I'd rather listen, you know, A: I listen to heavy metal or classic rock. B: What, what kind of heavy metal are we talking about? B: What, A: We're talking about what they, what they call hard rock. B: Okay, B: like, give me some examples. A: Like, for example, let's see, uh, Bad Company, A: what, B: Oh, well, Bad Company's not bad, B: that's not, A: well, they're like, for example, A C D C. B: Yeah, B: A C D C A: Why, A: have you heard of them? B: Yes A: Okay. A: And, stuff like that. A: That's, that's, that's not really hard rock. B: Well, okay. B: Okay, B: I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal. A: Okay. B: I mean, I, I think, when you say heavy metal, I'm, I'm thinking about like Cinderella, you know. A: Well, Cinderella is, is hard rock, heavy metal. B: Well, see, I don't really care for Cinderella B: But, I like A C D C's okay. A: But, see, for example, they have, see what, A: but other bands consider it like really hard rock. A: It's like brash metal, which all they do is like, they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar, A: and the guitar is set like, really low, B: Yeah. B: No, B: I don't really care for that too much, I guess. A: and, what happens is like, oh, everybody gets like totally into the music A: and then they start dancing around, B: Uh-huh. A: and they just bump into each other, B: Uh-huh. A: like, like they hit each other with their shoulders, B: Uh-huh. A: and, then, you knock people down, A: and what you do is, you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people. B: Is that the kind of music that you like? A: No, A: I don't like that music. B: Oh, okay. A: But, that's, that's what they do. A: That's, that's what some people call like really heavy metal. B: Oh, okay. A: And, see, the difference, I guess, between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also. A: Like really, like heavy metal, is considered, like the words heavy metal A: and, like, you always thought about, like, suicide. And killing people and stuff like that. B: Yeah. A: And, just hard rock has, A: they, they don't talk about that, A: they just talk about, like, life in general. B: Right. A: Like, Queen's Reich, if you ever heard of them. B: Oh, sure. B: Of course. A: Yeah. B: you, you're talking Queen, B: is that what you said? A: Okay, A: well, no. A: I said Queen's Reich, A: but, but, oh, but you got to like Queen also. B: Oh, oh, oh, okay, B: Right. A: So because, B: Well sure, B: because Queen was real popular when I was growing up. A: Yeah, A: especially, uh, oh God, what is it, A Night At The Opera? A: Don't they have a, A: no A: let's see, the one that they have the, the whole opera singing in the background. B: Oh! Right, A: Bo, Bo, Bohemian Rhapsody. B: right, B: yeah, B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: that, that was great. A: I heard that the other day on the radio A: and I pumped it up. A: Because, I mean, I just love that song. B: Yeah, B: that, that was a real good one. A: Yeah, A: but they had, A: that, that whole record was pretty good. A: But then, they started going downhill like everybody else. B: Well, that's true. B: They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that. A: Yeah, A: they're, they're still around, A: they've got a new C D out, A: but I, I wouldn't buy it. A: Because see, what happens is, the old, see A: I like, I like the old Rolling Stones. A: I don't like the new stuff. B: Of the Stones? A: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: I agree. B: That's the B: the older stuff is the best of it. B: The, the new stuff's kind of more like, today's rock and roll, which I, don't really care for today's rock and roll too much. A: Yeah. A: Well, for example, I used to like old Phil Collins. B: Right. B: Yes, B: definitely. B: I agree. A: And, and, then what happened was that Phil Collins said, hey I can make money, a lot of money doing this, A: and then he came out with, uh, see, for example, his, his record like, No Jacket Required. B: Uh-huh. A: That was good, A: but it was on his way of going downhill, A: because he said, I can make a lot of money just singing alone, A: and then he came out with the Invisible Touch, with, uh, Genesis A: and that really, A: like now, I hate Phil Collins, A: I can't stand him. B: Right. A: Because, I look at him A: and I say, you know, you were singing at this time, and with these people, A: and you were great, A: and now you're singing all this stuff that, doesn't matter what you, what you sing or what you record, A: it's still going to be a number one hit. A: And so, that's, that's what gets me mad. B: Yeah. A: But, did, did you go see that new Doors movie? B: No, B: not yet. B: I guess I've been, kind of considering it. B: Have you seen it yet? A: Yeah. A: I saw it when it opened. B: Was it really good? A: Yeah. you know, like those guys that criticize movies? B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: And, they both loved the movie, right? B: Uh-huh. A: They said the music's great, A: it took me back to the sixties, and stuff like that. B: Uh-huh. A: And then, one of them said, well, everything is great, A: but I'm going to give it thumbs down. A: And they go, A: but why? A: Because it's like, the end is, like, really depressing. A: And so, B: Oh. A: But it, but it's like the movie is so well made, A: and the music that goes with it just picks you up, see, A: I was never, I was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine. B: Oh, okay. A: So, I mean, so for me, B: So, you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then. A: No, A: but you learn to. A: I mean it's just that, like the, the sixties music's got a lot to say. B: Right. A: I, I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too. A: You know, I was like, B: Well no, B: I've never liked disco. A: Hey, A: but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants, B: Well, that's true B: That's true. B: But, I was more in the late B: well, I B: like mid to late seventies, like between seventy-five and, and, seventy-nine, was more my era. A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: Did, did you go to college? B: Well, no. B: I'm going right now A: Oh, that's cool. B: But uh, no B: I didn't go then. B: But see, I graduated high school in seventy-eight, A: Okay. B: so, you know, in seventy-eight, you know rock was starting to get really heavy, you know, B: and real, um, I don't know, A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: disco was pretty much dead by then. A: Yeah. B: So, so that's what I mean, B: disco wasn't really my time. A: Well, they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in, in progression, ever in history. A: So, B: About music? A: No, A: about everything. B: Oh. Okay. A: So, it's like, nothing happened during the seventies. A: Everything happened during the sixties, A: the seventies I don't know what they're called, you know, A: it's like, like A: the, the eighties are called, like the progressive years, or the, or, you know, like the technology years, because of all the computers and stuff. B: Uh-huh. A: But the seventies got nothing. A: I mean, nobody cared to name it B: That's kind of funny A: So. B: You're right. B: I never thought of that. B: The disco years, that's what they're calling them, are gone. A: Yeah, A: I know. A: Can you imagine the, like a big picture of John Travolta, ta-da, what is it SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER? A: Him just standing there. B: Yeah, B: right. A: Yeah, A: that's a good example to look for in history. A: Well, from now on we're going to go from the, from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon, to nineteen eighties. A: Okay, A: what happened in the middle? A: Don't worry, A: don't worry, A: you're not, you're not missing anything, you know, A: so, B: That's true. B: Well, except for Vietnam. A: Yeah, A: really. A: And, that's, that's why I guess, everybody, B: You know with, A: yeah, A: it's like they don't want to talk about that, A: so they just, don't name it. A: I mean, it was, it was, I guess it was pretty bad times. B: Yeah. B: Well, that's very true B: But, A: Oh, well, let's see, A: yeah, A: okay, A: we've been talking for seven minutes, A: so, B: Oh, good. B: I haven't even been keeping track. A: Okay, A: all right, A: so um, I'm going to leave you alone. A: Uh what, what are you doing? A: Do you have a family? B: Uh, yeah. A: Okay. B: We're kind of, I was kind of in the middle of supper, B: but it's not a big deal, A: Oh, I'm sorry. B: I just left it. B: No, B: it's okay, B: because see I didn't, see B: somebody tried to call me last night B: but I didn't have my number yet, B: I just got it today. A: Oh, okay. B: And so, you know, it's okay. B: I, I told them I'd be available during this time, B: so, anyway. A: Okay. A: All right. A: So then, uh, have fun doing this. A: It is not, that bad. B: Okay, B: thanks. A: Bye, bye. B: Great, B: Bye. A: All right, um, A: I think the topic was crime in the city. B: Right. A: I do not live in a city. A: I live in a real small little place. B: Where is that? A: Uh, it's about thirty miles from Sherman. B: North, south, east, or west? A: It's north of Sherman. B: Well, you live almost in Oklahoma A: Not too far. B: Yeah . B: That's kind of ironic, because I don't live too far from Oklahoma either. A: Huh-uh. B: You know where Saint Joe is? A: Uh, I've been through there. B: I'm about eight miles south of it. A: Okay. A: Oh, yeah. A: I had been through Saint Joe, A: but, um, just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that, it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad. B: Well, you know, I've, I've seen those statistics and everything, B: and you know, what frightens me, is that, you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert with high tech weaponry, you know, A: Huh-uh. B: I mean, the Iraqis didn't have a lot of high-tech weaponry, B: but they had mortars and machine guns, tanks and all that. A: Oh, yeah. A: Sure. B: And, they didn't kill as many people in, in forty-five days, B: and they were intending to kill people, A: Huh-uh. B: I mean, that was their job, as they killed in Washington D C. A: Oh, I know, A: I know. A: I know. A: Um, I think nowadays people just, really just, murder is nothing to them, you know. B: Well, I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years, I guess. B: And, I've come to the conclusion, and this is a pretty scary thought to me, even, that if a guy is convicted, or a gal is convicted, of a crime, rather than put them in prison, because prison's proven not to work, just let them go. B: Say okay, you're convicted A: Huh-uh. B: and just let them go A: Yeah. B: and if they get convicted again, well, just kill them. A: Yeah, A: because, uh, most likely that will happen, won't it, that, you know, B: Well, I think that the best hope to eliminate crime, as we know it today is to eliminate the criminals from society. A: Huh-uh. A: Huh-uh. B: If someone is known to have been in prison, they can't get a job. A: No. B: You know. A: Yeah. B: They can't be accepted into society. B: You know, if they're not going to be accepted into society, then everybody's going to become sociopathic. A: Huh-uh. B: And, you know, who's to put the limit on it? B: I mean, I was watching a thing last night, up in Washington State. B: If you get convicted of, uh, sexual offenses, on a regular basis B: You know, I mean, some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions. A: Huh-uh. B: And they're still let out on the street after one or two years. B: Well, in Washington State, if you're a habitual sexual offender, they just don't let you out. A: Um. B: So you serve your prison term, B: and then you go into the mental hospital, B: and if you're pronounced cured, they'll let you go. A: Huh-uh. B: Well, they may find a cure for it, B: but there is no known cure now. A: Um. So you're, you're kind of thinking, A: in other words, if you get, if you do something the first time, that's not real bad, you know, B: Hey , people make mistakes. A: yeah, A: to go ahead and let them go, A: but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then, uh. B: Well, yeah, B: use that B: or, you know, there's other consequences rather than killing them, you know, B: you could, always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against. A: Oh. A: Huh-uh. B: You know. A: Yeah. B: At least they might have get some benefit in that, B: and if the people they committed a crime against, feel, at some later date, that these people have learned their lesson, are, are okay, you know, well, they can free them. A: Huh-uh. B: But, uh, you know, with the technology we have today, you can put a collar on a guy's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property. B: I mean, it will just in incapacitate them. A: Huh-uh. B: And, you can put a collar around a guy's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act. A: Huh-uh. B: But, you know, putting them in prison, my God, that doesn't work. A: No, A: apparently not, A: because look how many years they've been doing that A: and look A: I mean, yeah. B: Well, you look at places like Turkey. B: Turkey has the death penalty, for just about everything. A: Huh-uh. A: Huh-uh. B: I mean, if you get convicted of, uh, you know, drug trafficking, they just kill you. B: You get convicted of, uh, you know, heinous crimes, they just kill you. B: I mean there's no two ways about it. A: Huh-uh. B: And, uh, you look at their society B: and the repeat offenders are very few. B: You know, and you look at our society, almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison, has been in prison three or four times. A: Three or four times, A: yeah. B: I mean, You know, the way to stop that kind of behavior is, is two-fold. A: That is true, A: I know. A: Yeah. B: One, you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven. B: I, I think that's very important. A: Oh, I'm, I agree very much so on that, A: I, A: yeah. B: And then, if a parent has proved to be unfit, for any reason take the kids away from the parents. A: Huh-uh. A: Yeah. B: Because, you know, we are what we teach. A: Huh-uh. B: Because that's what our society becomes. B: We have, We have just a bunch of people, A: comes, A: yeah. B: and I've, and I've, I've lived in that, that environment for quite a few years when I was doing construction work. B: You know, and these guys, they come to work every morning B: and they're stoned to the bone. B: I mean, their so high, they could fly up to the top of that building *spelling: they're B: and they work all day, B: and they go home B: and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs B: and when they run out of money, they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money, B: and then they go back to work on Monday. A: Huh-uh. B: And, the kids of these people . A: Sure, A: they just think that's the normal thing to do, don't they ... B: They're sociopathic. A: Yeah. B: And I worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester A: Huh-uh. B: and these kids were more foulmouthed than I've ever been. B: I had one kid threaten my life, Threaten my life. A: In the first grade B: Told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death. A: Oh, know B: You know, and they flipping me the finger and all that A: Huh-uh. B: and I just said to this kid, B: I said, you got two choices kid, B: you can step into mainstream society B: or you can die. A: Huh-uh. B: Because you will eventually be killed. B: And, I just, I'm just totally aghast at a what's going on. A: Oh, I know. A: I know, um, A: I work in school. You know, A: that's something I do A: and I, it really is A: I'm like you A: astonishing what the younger ages know, A: and they react to what they see at home. You know. B: Huh-uh. A: If they see violence at home, that's what you're going to get from the kids at school. B: Exactly. A: You know. It really is, A: and that's kind of sad. B: Well, you can see it in the work place, you know. B: Used to be when you had a personality conflict you just, you worked with it B: and you got through it. A: Huh-uh. B: Now, you know, people get fired, B: or what's even worse, is they promote them into a position that they can't handle and let them get fired. A: Yeah. B: Or, one thing or the other. B: You look at another kind of society like the Japanese. B: You put that many people on that small of a space, they've learned to live together. B: Okay. B: It's in their culture. A: Huh-uh. B: And one of the things that's in their culture that I really think the major corporations should pay attention to, is the fact that, while Japan was becoming a great power, financially, the people that worked for those companies, worked for the same company they worked for at sixty-five, as they did when they were eighteen. A: Teen. B: And the company, took it upon itself to find a position for these people. B: If they weren't fit for the job they were hired for, they didn't just can them, B: they made a position for them some where. A: Huh-uh. B: You look at Frito Lay. B: My wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist. B: You know, transcribing stuff into the computer. A: Huh-uh. B: Well, she could type about one-hundred and five words per minute, B: but she don't like it. B: She just doesn't like to do that. B: I mean, she will. A: Yeah. B: But, you know, her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is have ... A: Um, what kind of hobbies do you have? B: Um, I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting, when I do have spare time. A: Really, A: I like cross-stitch too. B: Oh, I love it. A: I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately. B: That's my case also. B: I've got a new born B: and there's just no time. A: Uh-huh. B: Have you been cross-stitching long? A: Oh, several years. A: My husband is even interested in it now. A: He likes to help me design, um, you know, projects that are, a little more customized. B: Oh, really. B: Mine, sort of, he looks at the pattern B: and he says how do you get that from there to the material A: Not that hard. B: Oh, it's not. A: I really enjoy it. A: Uh-huh. B: I do a lot of my own patterns also. A: Yeah. B: In fact, I did one, BILL THE CAT, you know, from Glenn County that, uh, was a real good one to do. A: Oh, yeah. B: It was tough, B: but, uh, yeah. B: Do you have any others, B: or is this mainly cross-stitching? A: Um, I do mostly that, um, A: not very artistic really for like painting and stuff. B: Oh, uh-huh. B: Um, Yeah. A: But, now I don't know. B: I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors A: Oh, really A: Yeah, A: I've got the kits to put them all in. A: I don't have them all yet certainly. B: Yeah, B: right. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: I got to counting the other day B: and, uh, I think I have, what was it two hundred, B: and I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this is, uh, B: it, yeah, it can add up quick. A: Oh, yeah. A: I just, I just keep an inventory of what I currently have, A: and then when I start a new project, I go through and see if I, if I, you know, A: just buy the colors that I need of what I'm low on. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. B: I see. B: Well, now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead, you know, what comes close. Because a lot of them are similar. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: A lot of times you can do that. A: I think, I A: the pinks, there's like forty-two different shades of pink. B: Good grief B: Yeah, B: there's lots of pinks and greens. A: Pinks and greens. A: Yeah. B: There's lots of shades of greens. B: But the colors, B: I just love all the different colors. A: Yeah. B: They had quite a few new ones come out last year, that they added to. B: But, you don't have much spare time either? A: Well, not lately A: I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there. B: Oh, yes. B: And that does take some time. B: And if we're trying to get acclimated with the, uh, with having a baby, B: and . A: Yeah. A: How old? B: He's seven months old. A: Oh, yeah. B: And just into everything, B: so there's not a spare moment. B: Oh, but I wouldn't trade it for the world. B: I've been trying to do some bibs for him. And, uh, work on his Christmas stocking. A: Oh, yeah. A: Yeah. B: We missed it last year, B: so hopefully this year he'll have one. A: Yeah. A: Well, last year he was a little bit young for having one. B: Right. A: He wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway A: You would have A: but, B: Right. B: If it tasted good, yeah. B: All he liked was the lights this year, B: so. A: Oh, yeah. B: Oh, well, that's neat that you like cross-stitching also. A: Yeah, A: that's, that's kind of strange that we got the same call. B: Yeah. A: It's a call. B: Oh, I'm sorry. B: Go ahead. A: No, A: that's okay. B: Okay uh, B: but, yeah, B: I've been doing it for probably ten years or so. A: Oh, wow. A: No, A: I just started about, well, five years ago, I think. B: But it is peaceful, B: I mean it is relaxing to do, once you find the time to do it. A: Uh-huh A: There's also a couple of large projects, baby afghans, A: and I got one done A: and I think the other one is going. The child is going to be in high school before I get finished. B: On that, uh A: Bear thing . B: is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the, with the large squares? A: Well, yeah A: I just, I bought the cloth and the pattern for it. A: I didn't, um, I didn't buy the, uh, I didn't buy a kit. B: Oh, uh-huh. B: Well I've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching. A: Uh-huh. A: It's that cloth. B: Oh, okay. A: It's cloth I think. B: Uh-huh. A: And it has the borders and everything already. B: Yeah. B: Those are pretty. A: Number one turned out just great, A: and the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors, that they had decorated the nursery A: and I didn't even know it. B: Oh, that's a . A: I gave it to her A: and she said how did you know those are the colors we used. A: I said didn't B: That was a good . A: It worked out that way. B: That's great. B: Uh, that, uh, B: now I've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it. A: Uh-huh. B: I like those. B: Those are pretty. A: Yeah. A: Lilly, Lilly , she said, she said it's for your daughter to use. A: Oh, no. A: She said, I know she doesn't get to touch it. A: She hung it on the wall. B: Yes, B: my, uh, grandmother, um, made us a couple of quilts for the baby, B: and I was like, oh, I don't want to mess those up. A: Yeah B: Uh, they're just too nice. B: I mean you don't get many hand made quilts anymore. A: Yeah. B: Oh, yeah. A: True. B: Well, I've enjoyed this. A: Okay. B: But, uh, well keep up the good, um, B: keep up the cross-stitching. A: You too. B: All right, B: thanks. A: Uh-huh, A: bye bye. B: Bye bye. A: I was trying to think about some of my favorite people that I liked in music A: and they're, none of them are recent, right. B: Uh-huh. A: So I like Gordon Lightfoot, A: do you know who he is? B: Yeah A: And the Moody Blues, A: and I like to listen to piano music a whole lot, A: and Willie Nelson. B: Uh-huh. B: So you like a, a variety. A: Yeah. B: Sort of easy listening because you like country B: but then, A: But not all country. A: I don't like that, when they start, B: Um. A: I don't know. A: I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he's such a character. B: Oh, uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I, I like some of his songs, though. B: They're, they're not so, they're not so sad country all the time. B: They're just kind of sweet sometimes. A: Yeah. B: You know, I mean they're not the, the typical country where they're just, you know, my wife left me, my dog left me, you know A: My truck is broken down. B: Yeah, B: my truck's broken down B: and my house just burned down, you know. A: Yeah. B: But, A: There, there's a guy, A: have you ever heard of George Winston, A: he plays piano. B: No. A: I think he's dead now, A: but he plays wonderfully. B: Uh-huh. A: I like that. B: Are, are you, do you play the piano, B: is, B: or you just like it? A: Very badly. A: I've got a piano, B: Yeah. A: my mother got a piano A: and, uh, vowed that someone in the family was going to learn, A: so we all had to take lessons, A: and I was the one that did the least poorly, A: so she gave it to me. A: And it's sitting here mostly taking up space, A: but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it. A: It is real relaxing. B: Yeah, B: it must be fun to be able to play it B: and, you know, if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be, it'd be kind of fun, I think. A: Yeah. B: because I mean, I play the flute B: and not many things you can play that'll, you know, people will sit there and sing along to B: and you can't sing along either B: so, but, uh, I like a lot, uh, B: I like classical music just because of the, B: when, I, I don't play, B: I like jazz music B: but A: Oh, so do I. B: What's that? A: Forgot about that. B: What's that? A: I said so do I, A: I forgot about jazz B: Yeah, B: I like a lot, like, B: I like, uh, is it the New Age music, like with, uh, uh, the, B: I don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection. A: Yes, A: we've got about five of those. A: I love them. B: Yeah, B: I love those, too. B: They're just so relaxing. A: Uh-huh. A: I'd never heard them before until I went in a music store A: and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it B: Yeah. A: and I just, I heard a piece A: and it was just so wonderful. B: Yeah. A: And then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it. B: Isn't that nice. B: I mean it's nice when you have a piece that, that is so, so peaceful, that everybody likes, you know, A: Yeah. B: and, uh, it, it, it, it, you know, it has pieces that are uplifting, B: but, it, it's mostly relaxing B: and you don't, because it doesn't have words, you know, you don't feel like, there's anything you have to remember, you know, as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean B: or, but, uh, A: I mean you can just sit, A: you know those little booklets that come along with it B: Yeah. A: and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music. B: Yeah. A: My, my little boy has gotten so into it that A: he's identified the, the people that have written certain songs, A: then he buys the pieces that have that person. You know, on it. B: Yeah. B: Oh, I see what you're saying. A: Huh? B: Yeah. A: I mean, I don't even know who did which ones, A: but he does. B: I, I can't identify them either. B: I just like them. B: I could, I know which ones come next, B: but I don't even know their names. B: Most of them I don't know their names of the song, B: but I, I can identify them. B: But I like that B: and I like, uh, course I, I like classical music. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, A: Were you in the band? B: I was in the band, B: yeah A: So was I. B: and I was in, like, chamber music groups and stuff, B: so I'm used to pieces B: and, and I played classical flute, B: I didn't play, play jazz flute or anything like that, B: so. I I can relate to it, I suppose B: But, uh, and I like, I'm like you I like the older stuff, too, B: because I like Chicago A: Yeah. B: and I like I like, uh, uh, let me think who, uh, B: you don't know Hebert Laws, B: but Hebert Laws a flute player, B: he's a jazz flute player B: and I like, uh, uh, Chuck Mangione, B: do you know who Chuck Mangione is? A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I like Chuck Mangione B: Trying to think of all, uh, oh, B: what's his name, plays the trumpet. Yeah. A: I like the Moody Blues. A: Did you like them? B: Yeah, B: I like Moody Blues. B: I, I like mostly the older groups I think. B: Oh, B: but we do have, B: I like Simply Red, B: we got Simply Red. B: I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like B: And, uh, I like Breeze, B: I like the group. B: I think just because they all sort of sound, they sound a lot like uh, Simply Red. Uh. A: So what type, Simply Red, A: I've never heard of that. A: Is it just instrumental? B: No, B: it's, it's got people singing, B: but it's it is instrumental. B: But it's, it's got people singing B: but it's got a, like a whole bunch of people singing. A: Yeah. B: You know, how many people are in Simply Red, Stuart to someone else in the B: he can't hear me. B: I, I don't remember how many people, B: but, it's, it's got men and women B: and it's not, it's, it's nice, B: I mean it's pleasant, you know, music. B: It's not where it's, it hurts your ears to hear it. B: But it's not as, it's not like, uh, Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it. B: You know, it doesn't have, like all the brass and everything. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: Well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road A: We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend. A: And, then I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs. B: Oh, you must live in this area. A: Yeah, A: where are you? B: We're in Sherman. A: Okay. A: So we're in Garland. B: Oh, okay. B: You're going to Commerce? A: Yeah B: For East Texas or something? A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: Oh, okay. A: Just because there's a friend up there, A: not because there's much else B: Oh, okay. B: Well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas. B: That's why I was just A: For colleges? B: Yeah, B: East Texas is recruiting for, you know, their fall semester A: Well, they're not B: and they're, they've been doing a lot of that in the area. A: They're not going to recruit me anymore, A: I'm through. A: No more for me. B: No more, huh. A: What, what do you do? B: Well, right now I'm just a homemaker, B: but I'm going to school, uh, for legal assistant B: and that's what I know, B: so, and, uh, just nothing basically A: Are you going to go to East Texas for that? B: No, B: no, B: it, B: no B: I don't go to East Texas. B: I got a degree from T W U, B: but I'm really interested in legal, you know, in the legal environment, B: but I don't want to be a lawyer B: so I said well, I think I'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant. A: That'd probably be pretty interesting. A: I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week. A: They had summonsed eight hundred people, A: about four hundred showed up, A: and it was for a murder trial. B: Oh, uh-huh. A: This guy had supposedly, uh, strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose A: Anyway, this is happened in nineteen eighty-three. B: Yeah. A: And they had us fill out a long questionnaire. A: We stayed till about one thirty A: and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time A: and the trial won't take place until June. B: Yeah, B: that's how it works. A: And they say it's going to last about two to three weeks. A: And this guy in front of me said, I can't believe I was summonsed. A: I was an investigator A: and I was tailing the woman that was killed. A: Well, then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer A: and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband A: and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it. A: And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been, uh, getting cocaine from his client and then selling it, A: and he had skipped bail A: and they finally extradited him A: and he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced. B: And this is the man that was in front of you? A: Yeah. B: Oh, well they'll, weed him out. A: The, the investigator. A: Yeah, A: he, he got off right away. B: Yeah. A: And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that, B: Uh-huh. A: so I figure that that will make me biased A: and I won't be chosen. B: Well, not necessarily A: Hopefully B: but there's probably something else that might make you. B: Because you could know about, you could know about the crime, but not necessarily be taken off the jury, you know, not be accepted for the jury. A: Yeah. No. *aa B: I mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, you know, and, and know some of the different things about it B: but, uh, they, they might weed you out some other way. B: You know, if you, if you don't believe, like if this was a capital crime and, and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty, you're not going to be picked at all. B: So but, A: it, I'd feel a lot better, B: but, uh, I'm, I'm starting to learn that there's always something else. B: Once you get done, you can always start over B: and, and you make up all kinds of excuses. A: Are you having to repair the walls at all? B: It, B: they're, they're in pretty good condition, um, as far as, uh, major repairs. You know, a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that, B: but, uh, the only, B: the most major things have been, uh, oh, I guess I, I moved a couple of outlets, and, er, uh, switches I should say. B: For some reason, they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway B: and, uh A: Um, that's smart. B: yeah, B: and I, I didn't like that very well, B: so I, I moved that, B: but, uh, most of it, most of it's in pretty good shape. A: So where do you live? B: Uh, live in Dallas. A: I'm in Garland. B: Okay, B: okay. A: Did you try to call this weekend? B: Uh. A: To that switchboard, A: did you keep getting that it was down? B: No, B: no, B: I haven't, B: uh, I hadn't tried. A: You didn't? B: In fact, we were, we were planting flowers this weekend B: So, uh, I was pretty tied up, B: but. A: Yeah, A: well, I've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything. B: Uh-huh. A: I don't know, A: I can't think of anything else to say about painting. B: Yeah, B: that, uh. A: It hurts your back, A: and it hurts your arm. B: Yeah, B: you know it B: I get a I get a sore neck from looking up all the time, yeah, things like that A: Yeah. B: but, uh, no, B: that pretty much covers my experiences. A: But you're glad you're doing it, A: right? B: Oh yeah, B: most definitely. B: It, it just, B: it makes such a difference. B: I, B: like I say, the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much. B: Uh, I, you know, I, I don't want to put a price on it, B: but I just feel like we're, every, every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house. B: You know, every time I do something, aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home, an you know, the walls are clean, B: and they match, and all those kinds of things. A: Uh-huh. A: Do you have one of those straightedge things to put underneath when you're doing the baseboards? B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: we do. B: It, uh, it sometimes works B: and it sometimes doesn't. B: It's a, uh, B: when I start doing trim, I, I've gotten to where I, I tend to freehand it because there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that, uh, it, it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore, B: and uh. A: On your baseboards? B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: they A: You don't have any carpet down in your house? B: No B: there's no carpet in the house right now. A: See, we've got carpet, A: and, I haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it, on down, so that you won't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet. B: Um, A: Because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it. B: Well, you know, um. A: You can't hold it there until it's dried. B: Yeah, B: I, I've I've seen, uh, B: they're, they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths. B: And, you can, uh, you can tape them together B: and, and, and put ... A: What do you think about, uh, the way the criminal justice system handles trials? B: Well, you know, they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers A: Yeah. B: but, you know, it's pretty hard to try, let's say, the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people, B: like the juries that I've served on, are businessmen. A: Uh-huh. B: Okay B: now they don't understand that, you know, maybe he needed fifty dollars B: so he held up the seven eleven. *Seven Eleven A: Yeah. B: Okay B: they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars, all the time, B: so, you know, I think that it, a trial by your peers should be exactly that, someone in your own age bracket, B: someone that, you know, you can't really do it ethnically, you know, B: but you could do it, you could probably get it a little closer. A: Yeah. B: But then there's another thing that I disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six B: and sometimes you have a jury of twelve. A: Yeah. B: And I don't know why they do that. B: Do you have any reason, B: do you know of any reason why they do that? A: Well, I think the six is called a Grand Jury A: and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial. B: Okay, B: see A: Whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused of, you know, and held over for trial. B: Okay B: I don't know much about the Grand Jury. B: How do you feel about the, B: in Texas I noticed since I've been here, in twelve years that they, they break up the, the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial. A: Yeah, A: I don't know. A: I, I think that, uh, A: I know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked. A: However, B: Well, we know there's a few out there. A: Yeah. A: It seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it, you give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong A: or for, you know, A: if, if, if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off, much easier than twelve people could. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah B: it's, B: Yeah, B: would be pretty hard. B: Well I don't think, you know, I don't think that, if I was the criminal, that I would like the judge passing sentence on me. B: If the jury found me guilty, then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be. B: And I think it's, B: not only that, it's a waste of our money. B: We have to have a trial for this person, B: then two weeks down the road we have to excuse me, set a sentencing date so now we're back in court again A: Uh-huh. B: and that's more money spent. A: It's not so much that I, that, I haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges. What bothers me is that, uh, they really don't mean anything. B: No. A: Someone could be sentenced to thirty-five years A: and yet, you know, the, the parole system, it's going to let them out in, in three years for good behavior. B: And it's not working either. A: No, A: it's not. B: It seems that we have more and more repeat offenders. A: Uh-huh. B: I know, B: I don't know how you all are there where you're at, B: but where we're at, now our jails are overcrowded. B: We just built a brand new one two years ago. A: Oh, I think they're all overcrowded. B: And it's overcrowded. A: They've, uh, B: So now they start turning them loose. A: I think I heard Fort Worth that, uh, they've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowded. A: They're not allowed to accept any new inmates. A: Now what are they supposed to do? B: They turn them loose. A: Well, no, A: I mean, they're not allowed to accept any new inmates. B: Yeah. A: So what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail? A: You know. B: Well, the way, it seems the way it's been working here's, A: There, yeah, B: Go ahead. * LISTEN are utterances 1 and 2 really from the same speaker? B: It seems the way it's been working here is they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five to twenty sentence, or five to life. A: Uh-huh. A: Something that is working A: and I, I really like the system of house arrest where a, a, someone's wear, someone wears a bracelet like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor, B: Yeah B: that, B: Yeah, B: and they, They keep, A: and they are not allowed, A: I mean, some of them are even allowed to work, A: they can go to their regular job, A: they come home, A: they have to be home by such and such a time, A: they're instructed, uh, so that, this, this electronic monitor is turned on at, at a certain time B: Yeah. A: and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts. B: All right. A: And, uh, they can put a, A: they usually install a video monitor in the house A: and when the parole officer calls to check on them, they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it. So that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing B: All right. A: and that's working rather well. A: That's a good system. A: That allows people, to actually continue to be productive members of society while they're, you know, paying back for whatever crime they've committed. B: Yeah, B: instead of being completely penned up. B: And that way it would give, you know, B: the probation department and parole department, they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in, in Lubbock. A: Oh, yeah, A: yeah. B: And that would give, you know, B: at least they don't have to drive all over town trying to find one guy, or trying to see six or seven people. A: Uh-huh. A: I, I've really, A: I could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what I think we ought to do about it. A: But, Something that I really don't understand is when someone goes to jail and they have a job in jail and they work, that they should, B: Sometimes it's pretty messed up, B: isn't it. B: Uh-huh. A: I, A: and this may sound cruel, A: but I do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes. A: I mean they're in jail for crying out loud. B: Yeah. A: What do they need cigarettes for? B: Well, see B: and there's another thing about the justice system that I don't like B: and there's a lot of people that tell me that, that maybe my thoughts are wrong. B: I came from California A: Uh-huh. B: and when you're in jail, they take you out just like they do in Alabama or anywhere else, what they call a chain gang. A: Uh-huh. B: And they clean the city parks. A: Oh, I think that's a wonderful idea. B: And they clean the city streets. B: But you know, we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day B: and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner, A: More than that. B: and I know, B: yeah, A: More than that. B: but I know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that don't make that much. A: I know. B: And they're not, you know, they're not doing anything to support themselves, while they're there. A: The thing that, the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them, they're working. B: Yeah. A: When they get out of jail they get handed all that money. B: Yeah. A: That really ticks me off. A: I think that while they are in jail and they are working, their wages should go, B: Yeah. A: like, I don't know, A: they could, A: some percentage, like eighty-five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board figured on a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year. B: Yeah, B: well, Uh-huh. B: See now . A: And when they get out they should have a, I don't know, you know, some reasonable amount of money to start, like a couple of thousand dollars, B: Yeah. A: but there should be a limit over which they, that it all goes back to the State. A: Anything that they've earned while they're in prison should go back to the State except for that, you know, there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with. B: Yeah, B: but at least they would, at least that way they would be helping pay for their own. A: Exactly, A: absolutely. B: And something else that I would, And something else that I would like to see is, is, uh, victim reimbursement, you know, because they, you know, like you say these guys are in jail A: That's the part that I really think we need to change. B: and they're working, B: they're getting paid, B: but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from, or beat to death B: or, A: Has nothing, A: right. B: has nothing, you know. B: Our, our victims are victimized, period, B: and the law has no, no, uh, regulations to deal with that. A: Absolutely. B: They, they know how to deal with the penal system B: and they know how to deal with the criminal, B: but they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens, I guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect. A: Yeah. B: But it's, B: but I sure don't, B: I, I strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself. A: Uh-huh. B: There that, A: I think it works much better if it's, if it's the actual jury. B: Yeah, B: because, well, see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime, A: Uh-huh. B: the jury gets to see the whole trial, as does the judge, B: but you know, if, if they figure there's maybe litigating circumstances, or something like that whereas maybe the judge does, just doesn't care, you committed this crime B: so I'm just going to throw the book at you. A: Uh-huh. B: Whereas the jury may have a little, shall we say, sympathy, you know, B: he did this, B: but, you know, why did he do this, A: Yeah, A: in some, cases it would work that way. B: is there, is there a basis for it. A: In some cases it would work the other way. B: Yeah, B: in some cases where the judge says okay, I'll give you, you know, two to three years B: and, A: The jury would, would, slam them A: and, and I think that, that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time. B: Yeah. B: Well, they have a stronger debate, too, because there's twelve people there. B: They have to decide whether or not he's guilty B: and then they can sit in at the same time and decide what his punishment would be, A: Uh-huh. B: and you'd have more than one person's input on it. A: Yeah. A: I think that's probably a much fairer way. B: And, you know, we're supposed to be, and I quote, in a democratic society. B: So, you know, if you can find me guilty, then you ought to be able to pass sentence. A: Yeah. B: And a lot of jurors, B: not that I know of, B: but, you know, a lot of jurors may just sit there and say, yeah, he's guilty, B: but I don't have to deal with it from here, you know, B: so the judge takes care of all of that. A: Yeah. A: It might be more, A: it would be more work for the jury, A: but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it. B: Yeah B: it would, B: yeah, B: serving on the jury would be definitely more you'd have to be a definitely more responsible person. A: The thing that I, I don't really like, A: I, I don't know, if, uh, a lot of jury selection processes that I've seen have been a, A: Okay. B: Hi. A: Hi. B: Okay. B: You want to start? A: Um, yeah. A: Sure. A: Um, I think, I think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back. A: If you can't pay for it, you shouldn't have it. A: Period. A: And, B: That is very true. A: That's just. B: However, our whole economy is based on loans. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, uh, but, bet right this moment, you probably have several loans out B: or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something A: Well, B: Master Charge. A: I don't have a Master Charge, A: thank you B: But, see our whole system is built on owing not borrowing. A: Right. A: But, that's the problem, see. A: Our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that. B: Uh, true. B: But, uh, uh, without it, people wouldn't be able to own automobiles B: or they wouldn't be able to own a house. A: Yes, A: they would. A: They just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own. Or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own. A: We might have to, you know, just be able to, A: I think, if we, a generation went without debt, then the next generation, A: like, if, if our, our generation, A: my husband and I, we're twenty-eight, if we lived our lives and didn't become, you know, indebted, like you know, our generation before us, that, um, the budget would balance. And that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford, which we wouldn't be destitute, A: I mean, we wouldn't be living on the street, by any means. A: But just compared to how spoiled we are, we would be in our own minds, A: but I feel like the generation after us would, A: oh, man, it would be so good. A: It would be so much better. A: It wouldn't be perfect, A: but then, they could learn to live with what they could afford to save to buy. A: And if you want a nicer car than that, well, you save a little longer. B: Well, now I agree, uh I agree with you one hundred percent. A: Uh-huh. B: I'm just taking the other side so we'll have a discussion here. B: Uh, but I still go to right back to what I said. B: When is the time you had fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile? A: But, see, we made poor choices in college. A: We took out two, A: both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans, for student loans B: Uh-huh. A: and I look back on that, A: and I bought shoes. A: I went shopping. A: I did not need that money. A: I did not need it. A: I didn't need it. A: I shouldn't have even qualified to get it. A: I didn't need it. A: And it would have been a little rough, A: I might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli, A: but I did not need it. A: And as I look back now, now we're paying that back. A: I told my son, if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college, do it, A: but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans. A: Don't do it. A: And I don't, I hope, don't think he'll have to do that A: but, I just feel like if we didn't have those loans, we could have saved in the last five years the money for that, A: and I believe we would have, because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt, you know. A: But we have friends in church that do this on a constant basis, that are totally debt free. A: And they pay cash for everything they buy. B: Uh-huh. A: Including new vans, A: and, so, so I guess, I've seen it done A: and I know you can do it, you know. A: But you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van. A: And that's where Americans don't like to do it. A: And so and we don't want to cut back our services from the government, because we're spoiled. B: Well, I have one way to suggest reducing the budget. A: What? B: Very simple. B: Just take all these civil service employees, and, uh, uh, take some of those holidays away from them, like Columbus Day, President's Day, I mean, they, they get all these days off. A: I know. A: Yeah. B: Now give them, what a, a week, I think we here at T I get a total of eleven a year. A: I know. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's about, uh, three or four less than civil servants get. A: Uh-huh. B: Now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off, all those holidays. A: Yeah, A: that is true. A: Because I always think the mail never comes on these days A: and you're like, well, what is it A: You don't even know it's a holiday B: Well, now don't forget the mail is something else again. B: That has nothing, B: they're not civil servant people. A: But isn't it federal, in the federal budget? B: No, B: no, B: they have their own budget they go by. A: But isn't it part of our income, A: it's not part of our taxes? B: No. A: It's not? B: That's why the price of mailing a letter keeps going up. A: That's why it keeps going up, uh? B: You know, I could I can remember the days when it cost only three cents to mail, uh, uh, uh, a letter. A: That's another topic A: Those stamps are valuable, now. B: Yeah. B: They probably, B: hey, B: I ought to go looking through some of my old mail. A: That's funny. A: Yeah, A: and that is a good short term thing, though. A: That little things like that, that A: overall, though, I just think we're just going to, I don't know, see, A: I know, A: I guess I'm kind of leery of this topic, because I know that Bush is real for the new world order. The one world government, and alleviating all, you know, national debt between all of the nations. A: But I see that to be a potential power problem later, with, um, who's going to be in charge with this new world order. A: And I, you know, I'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place. A: But, I know, we already have a new money system. A: We already have new bills printed, for, A: the U S Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency, A: and I've seen them A: And so I know that the long-term vision for the U S government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh, A: but I'm concerned with who's going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about, you know. A: That's a lot of power for one or two people to have. A: And so, um, I guess because I, A: I guess, A: in fact, I know what their long-term vision is. A: I'm kind of like, you know, yeah, the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles. A: And I don't think Americans are willing to do it. B: Well, what about, uh, uh, sending all this money overseas supporting other governments, third world governments. B: How do you feel about that? A: I don't, I don't feel we should loan them money. A: If I, I wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things, A: and if we feel led to give a country money to help them, fine. A: But I don't feel we should be loaning money like that. A: I mean, it doesn't work, I mean. B: Well, in so many cases, it's not a loan, B: it's just a give away. A: But it's not, but it's not set up as a giveaway. A: If it were set up as giveaway, A: and it was something, that, I mean, our, our President and our leaders could be seeking God saying, God is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money, A: is it your will, this money and your will for us to give to them, A: and I believe if we gave it, no strings attached that God would bless our nation. A: But because we're, our motive is interest, our motive is not pure, it just backfires, A: I mean, none of these nations have paid us back. A: But, you understand, it's, I guess it's a principle of giving and receiving. A: You give it, no strings attached A: and they may never give you anything back, A: but because there's no strings attached, it like gives them a freedom to give us something back. A: And it might not be money, A: it might be, um, no taxes on our things, our computers going into their nation, A: it might come back in another way, A: but it would be come back. A: But because we're loaning it, I think that's the problem. A: And I don't mean give it to everybody that asks. A: Use a lot of discernment. A: Don't give money to every nation. A: You know, what I'm saying, A: I think we're loaning money to too many nations, A: but I think if we gave to a few select ones, that really needed it, that it would work out better for us and for them. A: And so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money A: and so I just think, we're never going to get that back, you know. A: Do you understand? B: No. B: That, that's true. B: I, I understand that France still owes us money from World War I. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, World War Two debts have never been repaid. B: I think the U S just wrote them all off. A: Yeah. B: And said, well, we'll cancel it just like they did to the, that Polish debt here, uh, last week. A: Yeah. B: Uh, uh, half the countries of the world simply canceled the Poland debts to help them. A: Right. A: Long, long term though, do you think it would best to see a one world, you know, A: you can't alleviate all national debts A: or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking God on how to turn our nation around financially? A: That's my opinion. A: My opinion's the latter. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, uh, I've got to respect your opinion. B: You have some solid ideas. A: Uh-huh. A: I know. A: What's yours? A: Do you agree A: or do you disagree A: or I mean, what do you think long term? B: Well, I don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, that's asking for trouble. B: People are too different. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the U S and find a tremendous differences between the peoples. B: They have their own ideas how things should be run. A: Uh-huh. B: So, therefore, I don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world. B: There's too many societies involved, uh, B: the language barriers. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, oh, sure, B: somebody said years ago, well, let's make it English, uh, international language. A: Uh-huh. B: That's a big laugh, B: we can't even make English a national language here in our country. A: Uh-huh. B: We've got too many, uh, uh, immigrants. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: I know. B: They don't call them immigrants anymore, B: that was back in my granddaddy's day. A: Yeah. A: Different ethnic groups B: Yes. B: Yeah B: but, A: Yeah. A: I know what your saying. *typo your you're B: My grandfather came over from Lithuania back, uh, just before the turn of the century A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger. A: Uh-huh. B: He, uh, was supposed to serve some time. B: Well, he did serve his time in the, uh, in the militia. A: Uh-huh. B: And he came back. B: He was a civilian again B: and his father said well if, B: Uh, tell you what. Um, I'll let you start A: Okay. A: My major source of information, I guess, is T V news A: Excuse me. I, uh, wake up to it in the morning. A: This is my, I guess, my prime time for news, first thing in the morning while I'm getting ready to go to work. A: Oh, I quite frequently glance through headlines or, in the newspaper. A: But, uh, primarily mine is T V news. A: How about yourself? B: Yeah. B: I have to, have to agree with you, um, B: I normally don't have time in the morning to, to watch any type of T V. B: Usually catch it going to work on the radio. Or when I drag the paper in from the front and it catch the head lines, which is normal what you see the night before on the evening news. A: Huh-uh. * I think this, and successive "Huh-uh" answers, should be "Uh-huh" A: True. B: So I've, I've kind of, B: we have a one year old in the house B: so it's kind of hard sometimes to watch T V during the night, B: but I usually try to catch the ten o'clock or, um, those type of . A: Huh-uh. B: I have to say, during the war we're, the American public was probably flooded with too much information B: and as far as the sub question about the, was, am I satisfactorily covered , I have to say yes. B: But when it came to the war issues, who's telling the truth. B: Between the channels there was, uh, the casualties, the amount of missiles launched were different B: and it was almost too much information, over communicated. A: Well, that's true, A: but I, A: my personal opinion is that the various network news medias were trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military. B: True. B: I agree with you. A: Now, I can appreciate that, especially after what happened in Vietnam. B: Yeah, B: which is a joke. A: Uh, let's face it, A: today's, uh, means of communication, we could, a newscaster could very well giveaway a piece of top secret information. And, uh, pat himself on the back for, for, uh, making a good scoop. B: Huh-uh. B: Yeah. B: That's a good point. B: Um, but I would have to say across-the-board, I'm satisfied with the way, uh, the news is spread. B: Um, of course here at Texas Instruments, uh, the rumor mill runs rampant. B: The secretary's probably the best resource, of what the layoff status is. A: Very true. A: I find T-News very enlightening, too. B: Yeah. A: And I check that everyday. A: Of course, with that goes along with the stock price of T I. B: Yeah. B: I agree you. B: I think, I'm glad you mentioned that, because I think I have to, since I don't have the opportunity in the morning I'll probably catch the head lines on T-News . B: That's a good point. A: Of course, T-NEWS is more or less headlines, B: Huh-uh. A: Uh, I don't think much of their sports coverage. B: Yeah B: True. B: Kind of, A: Only give the scores. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, that's all right. A: I'm not, outside of pro football, I'm not too interested in other games, other sports, anyway. B: Huh-uh. A: But, the, uh, T-NEWS is a good way to keep up-to-date. A: I think they do a pretty good job of selecting the most important items. B: Yeah. B: They do. B: Surely do. B: Uh, anything else crossed your mind. B: I guess most of us go by the audio, which is the television or the radio. A: Huh-uh. B: Um, but you need to continue to read, so you people learn to read, you know A: Well, I spent twenty years in profession, commercial broadcasting radio and T V, A: and I know what it takes to get some of those little bits and pieces of news on the air, B: Huh-uh. A: I mean, there, there are times where, uh, the reporter actually will risk is life, life and limb. A: I've seen it happen time and time again. A: And, uh, well, I remember one time up in Nashville, Tennessee. A: One of the fellows got mixed up in a riot that was going on down there, B: Huh-uh. A: but he was lucky he got out of it for some reason. A: Because he was carrying a camera, A: uh, they left him alone. B: Ouch. B: Everybody got excited. A: Huh-uh. B: That's tough. B: That's tough. B: Well, I've enjoyed speaking with you. A: Nice to talk to you, too, Jim. B: Did you get your catalog on your, your gifts? A: No. B: Really I just got mine in the mail B: so, it kind of sparked me to keep calling A: Oh. A: Well I'll be looking for it then. B: There not to shabby. *Correction "They're not too shabby" B: They're pretty good. A: Is that right? B: Yeah. B: Have a great day. B: Bye-bye. A: Now. A: I'm sorry, B: Ready to go. B: Okay. A: excuse me. And, uh, I do that, A: we recycle, uh, newspapers. A: We take, you know, the DALLAS MORNING NEWS daily, and the Plano paper daily B: Right. A: and, you know, after a month of that you got a ton, of newspapers. B: Oh, B: I know it builds up really fast. A: It really does, B: Yeah. A: I do recycle, newspapers and, uh, glass. B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: We don't really have enough plastic to mess with, A: we don't, you know, like we don't drink milk A: and we don't have children A: so we don't have, you know, six thousand plastic milk jugs, a month, you know. B: Yeah, B: we do, B: With two, a two year old and a, three year old A: Yeah. B: and, so it really builds up with us. A: Right. A: But there is, you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different, uh, container. B: Yeah. A: And, uh, Plano has plans A: I believe it's tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year, A: the city is going to leave, uh, receptacles at people's home. B: Oh, yeah, A: and they B: That would be much more convenient. A: It, certainly would B: Yeah. A: and they can separate it A: and then the, you know, trash guys will pick it up. Which would really be handy, you know, for people like shut ins, or, people who can't or don't drive, you know, B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Or it just builds up so often, A: they can't get to the these centers. B: Yeah. A: And I'm sure rather than try to, uh, ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them, you know? B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: But I think that's probably a good idea. B: They used to have several places, um, that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all, A: Uh-huh. B: and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable. A: Right. B: So finally, um, they, the people put so much pressure on the city, A: Uh-huh. B: they did a survey of everybody, A: Uh-huh. B: and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic, um, and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town, A: Uh-huh. B: and they, it just really, B: every time you went by there it was just over flowing, A: That's right. B: and so Wal-Mart complained A: Uh-huh, A: yes. B: so they moved it behind the store B: and nobody knew where it was, A: Yeah. B: and so people kept piling stuff in the same place, where it used to be. A: Uh-huh. A: Great B: Oh, it was just like a dump there, A: I bet it was. B: and so finally, you know, I called B: and they said, you know, it was behind there B: and I started taking my things behind there. A: Uh-huh. B: So we do that with, because we have milk cartons, you know, constantly, with two little kids, and the paper, A: Uh-huh. A: Sure. B: but it just builds up, A: Uh-huh. B: it would be so nice if they had it, you know at your home, where you could just turn it in so they, they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area in one neighborhood, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: and they have pickup there, B: it's, uh, I think once or twice a week. A: Uh-huh. B: And the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out B: so they had not much participation, B: and they were going to cancel it, A: Uh-huh. B: but then finally people started getting the message. A: Yeah. A: It's just a matter of education, I think. B: Yeah, B: and I think that, you know, if they can get enough going, they'll continue it, you know, throughout the rest of the city A: Uh-huh. B: but it's not, B: I think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this, A: Uh-huh. B: and it's not going to be, A: Yeah, B: I don't think A: yeah, A: that's right. B: Yeah. A: I think basically it's a good idea, you know, A: I hope it works. B: Yeah, B: I do to because it's amazing, how much, you know, trash, we can generate, A: Absolutely. A: absolutely. B: I know this year we took our Christmas tree B: they had a place, in the park where you could go have your tree shredded A: Right. B: and they gave you a little, um, seedling to plant, you know A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: you could take the, the mulch home with you, you know, and take buckets of that home, A: Uh-huh. B: so that was really good idea, A: Sure. B: I thought. A: Absolutely. A: And there's just, you know, the two of us my wife and I A: and it's amazing how much stuff just the two of us generate, B: Yeah A: you know, I can imagine a family of, you know, four or five. B: Oh, yeah B: it's really, B: it adds up so fast. A: It really does. B: Yeah. A: As far as new stuff to recycle, you know, I don't really, I don't really know, A: I really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth. B: Yeah. B: Well, they're working on diapers, which would be great, A: That's right, A: I was, A: Uh-huh. B: I've read so many different things about diapers B: and now their saying that originally they thought the disposables were just awful, A: Uh-huh. B: but now their saying that they're, really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them, and, you know, all different kinds of things too, A: That's right. B: so the diaper service, trucks B: apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver, and drop those off A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: So I don't know what's the, you know, right thing to do B: but I really would hope that they would come up. B: I know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable A: Uh-huh. B: but the landfill have to do something special, you know, for those, A: I see. B: but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too, B: so, A: Oh, I'm sure it must. A: Yes, A: you know I'm not personally involved because I don't, you know, I don't have any children that wear diapers, B: Yeah. A: but I'm sure it creates a large amount of, you know, uh, refuse. B: It does, B: and you just feel guilty if you don't do, something with them, you know, A: That's right . A: That's right. B: because you hate to contribute to the problem, A: Absolutely. B: but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either A: That's right, A: absolutely, A: absolutely. B: Yeah, B: I don't know what else they could recycle more of. B: I guess we don't really use that many tin cans. B: I guess there's some places where you can recycle aluminum B: but I don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff, in, A: Uh-huh. B: I don't know if those are recyclable B: or, A: I think they're made out of aluminum, B: Um. A: Yes. A: There are, there is a receptacle, you know, at the centers also for aluminum, B: Yeah. A: but again we don't, we don't generate that much A: so, B: Yeah, A: we don't, B: we don't either, A: Yeah. B: we usually use frozen vegetables and things B: so we don't really have, much of that. A: That's right. A: that, A: ninety-nine percent of ours is newspaper and, uh, you know, uh, glass. B: Yeah. B: Well, now when we lived out in California they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car, or for aerosol cans and things, like that because they say it's not safe to put those things, in the regular trash A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: That's right. A: Car batteries. B: Yeah A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: I don't, you know I don't change my own oil, A: so I don't, I don't, uh, don't have that problem. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: well other than that I'm not really sure, A: Yeah. B: we, we try to recycle old clothes A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: well we do to as a matter of fact. *typo too B: Our church has a place, where you can take them A: Right. B: and they, you know, pass them on to, other families, A: Yeah. B: so. A: Yes A: we have one of those in town. A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: You know, our church each year has a, A: one of their major fund raisers is, you know, a garage sale. B: Oh. A: And there's a ton of clothes always, you know left over A: and I take those down to the, A: uh, it's called the Clothes Closet, B: Uh-huh. A: that's what it's called here in Plano. A: Right. A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: And they distribute them to the people, that need them. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Yeah B: that's, that's real helpful, too. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Well, I'm not sure I can't really think of anything else that we could recycle. A: No, A: I can't either B: Yeah. A: I really can't, A: um, no, A: I, I really can't either. B: Okay. A: Okay, A: well, it was nice talking to you. B: You to. B: Take, care. A: Okay. A: All right. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Okay, A: what types of music do you like to listen to? B: Well, I primarily listen to classical music when I have my druthers, partly because I find it more soothing. B: I don't know a lot about classical music so far as, uh, any background in music, B: but it's the the music I enjoy the most. B: How about you? A: I like classical music also. A: I, uh, A: like you, I don't know a whole lot about it, A: and I, I would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff, A: but I'm not sure which composers or which I really like, B: Right. A: so I kind of hesitate to buy something. B: Uh-huh. A: There are certain kinds I like and certain kinds I don't. B: I tend to listen to the classical music, uh, on the radio a lot. B: There's, uh, one particular, well there several stations in this area that play, uh, classical music all the time, B: but there's one in particular that is on both A M and F M so I can listen to it without, uh, worrying. B: It's cute, though, because my children, when they get in the car, and I have, uh, the button pushed for that, they always switch it to something else B: Because naturally that isn't their taste at this point in time anyway. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I understand that. B: Are, are you involved in music? A: Uh, no, A: not really. A: My husband is, A: but not, I do, uh, the world a favor A: and I don't sing aloud, to anybody but myself B: Well, my whole family is somewhat musical, um, and not from training, but just because we sing in our choir B: and my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing. B: So, um, I think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music, too, because that's usually what happens if you, unless you get into rock, which isn't her voice style. B: So, A: Yeah, A: I, I don't care for rock, at all. A: I guess I'm real old fashioned in my musical tastes. B: No, B: I, B: well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious. A: Yes. B: It's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning. B: Now I do like folk song. B: Um, and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that, you know, kind of still hang around. A: Right. B: But, um, but, uh, the more popular music I don't care for, usually. A: Yeah. B: Um, even when I was a teenager I didn't really like the music of that period so much because I found I liked, um, a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular, rock and roll kind of sound. A: Yeah, A: I agree with that too. B: Although now I kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll, I guess it makes me think I'm young again A: Yeah, A: now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the New Age and all that stuff. B: Isn't that the truth? B: It's funny. B: In fact, it's interesting to me that so many of the songs, B: now I grew up in the late fifties and early sixties, B: and so much of the music that was popular at that time, has come back. A: Uh-huh. B: And, you, you don't hear everything all the time, B: but you hear much of the same music, perhaps a new version of it, B: but it's the same stuff. Um, which is always kind of funny. A: Right. B: Um, and I remember my older sister. B: I have a sister who's sixteen years older, B: and at the time that I was a teenager, a late teenager I guess, I can't remember the year, SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES became popular. B: I think it was done by maybe the Platters or something. A: Uh-huh. B: Then, B: and she laughed B: and she said, Well, you know, when I was a teenager, that had been, B: you know, some years before, she said, that was a version of, you know, a song then. B: And she said, It's very similar, B: but they've changed a little bit. B: She said, I like the original version better. B: Well, they did it again, about two or three years ago, B: and I laughed again. B: I said, Oh no, here we are A: Crops up every so often. B: Right, B: right. B: It does indeed. A: I listen to, um, the Christian radio station when I'm in the car. A: K L T Y. B: Uh-huh. A: I like to listen to some of that. B: Yes, B: now there, there's some wonderful Christian music when you can find good stations. A: Yeah. B: Uh, the problem that I found, um, in this area is that the, there, there is inconsistency in the quality here. A: Uh-huh. B: If you get someone who's very good at selecting, it's okay, B: but sometimes they kind of get on a, a, a binge, B: and they play the same sort of thing over and over again, without really necessarily quality. A: Yeah, A: where do you live? B: Uh, I live in the, uh, Washington, D C area, Maryland. A: I thought maybe you lived in Dallas, because that's the complaint I make to my husband about the radio station too. A: I said, Oh, they're playing one of their ten songs. B: Yes. A: It seems like every week they pick ten A: and they just play them over and over, B: Uh-huh, B: and I, I, you know, B: there's so much available that I don't understand why they do that. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: But, um, now my children have, have sometimes, B: um, they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come to our youth group at our church. B: And, um, and when they buy a tape or something, sometimes that's fun because it's different and something I've not always heard, B: and, you know, I enjoy that. A: Right. A: My husband likes Sandy Patty songs. A: He likes to sing those in church. A: He'd buy all the sound tracts he could get his hands on *typo tracks if he had the money to. B: Oh, wow. B: Yeah, B: that's nice. B: So, is your husband a singer? A: Well, just an amateur singer. A: He sings in the choir A: and he likes to do special music and stuff at church. B: Right. B: Yeah. B: Well, that's a good thing to do. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: I like to hear him sing. A: a very soft He does a good job. B: That's nice, B: uh, well, do you have children? A: No, A: not yet, A: we're expecting a baby in July. B: Well, wonderful. A: I guess we'll start listening, B: That'll be a musician. A: Yeah, A: maybe so. A: We'll start listening to children's music B: Oh, there's some wonderful Christian, uh, children's tapes. You can, uh, you can get, A: Yeah, A: there are. B: and I know when my children were younger, um, we found a lot of really nice tapes that they, that they liked. B: Um, there was an Agape music group, B: and, um, I, some of the songs I still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really, um, very memorable even though my children are now, A: Uh-huh. B: my youngest is almost sixteen. A: Oh, uh B: But I still find some of the same tapes, I, uh, some of the same songs from those tapes I enjoy. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, there's one that's, um, a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, she's playing the piano. A: Oh. B: And so she, she gets the wrong note every now and then. B: But then she keeps repeating it, practice makes perfect, B: and then you know, talking about that so far as Christian life, too, B: and it's really cute. A: Yeah, A: that sounds really cute. B: Yeah. A: Uh, I tell my husband to sing to my stomach, because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb, A: and I said, then when, when it's born you can hold it and sing that again B: Yeah, B: right. A: and maybe it'll comfort her, you know, when she's fussy and stuff. B: Yeah, B: well do you know something? A: What? B: Because I have always played classical music, uh, or classical style, B: it's not always classical as, you know, the official, uh, word might go, B: but, um, even when I was pregnant, of course I listened to that, B: and when our first child was, you know, an infant, um, of course, when I was around the house, I played that music, too. B: When he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale, the music scale. A: Huh. B: Someone else noticed it A: How strange. B: and I said, well, I guess that's true. B: And it was somewhat melodious, B: in other words it wasn't just A: Uh-huh. A: Babbly. B: you know, it was really funny A: I'll say, that is A: Well, we'll have to keep up with that then. B: Right, B: right. B: I do think there is probably an influence there, because I noticed that even though popular music, the, the wilder stuff, was around when my older children were, were, you know, adolescents, early adolescents, when they first start listening to music on their own they first get, ask for a radio of their own, and so on, A: Uh-huh. B: um, this same child, um, really listened to more, um, ballady or, um, pleasant sort of songs rather than, and even classical, rather than the real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to. A: Huh. B: And I, I never, I didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore A: Right, A: yeah, A: have something to rebel against B: Right B: But, uh, then I must say they all kind of like a variety of music, which is nice, B: I like that. A: Yeah, A: that's good, A: yeah, A: variety is good. B: Yeah. A: Well, I guess that covers it. A: It was real good talking to you. B: Well, it was nice talking to you, B: and good luck with the baby. A: Well, thanks, A: bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Okay Charles, uh, gun control, A: what are you, uh, for, in favor or no comment? B: I'm very much in favor of gun control. A: Oh, you are? B: Yes B: I am. A: Well, this should be very interesting, because I'm against it. B: I don't, I don't mind people owning guns, B: I just think it should be a little, you know, a little, a little more regulated. A: Well, you know, uh, now here's something that, uh, first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic, uh, weapons. B: Yes. A: Uh, now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons. B: I believe that's correct, B: uh-huh. A: And, yet, their, uh, the gun control enthusiasts are, are, uh, preaching about the gun control and how they should be, we should have stronger laws and what not. B: Uh-huh. A: I don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have. B: That would certainly help, B: I'm sure. A: Now this is not just a state law, A: this is a federal law, controlled by the Treasury Department. Uh, for fully automatic weapons. B: Uh-huh. B: Yep. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, all right, now for instance, in California where they passed the uh, uh, semiautomatic B: Uh-huh. A: or, or, uh, now what was it they called them? A: The military version, attack weapons, or something? B: Yeah, B: right, B: uh-huh. A: Uh, how is that going to affect the, uh, sports weapons? I mean, rifles, that are automatic or semiautomatic? B: Uh-huh. B: Yep. B: I really don't have any problem, Jack, with, you know, uh, people using firearms for sporting purposes. B: I don't have any problem, B: the only thing I, B: I am in favor of the seven-day waiting period. B: I would like to see that, see that happen. B: I, A: Uh-huh, A: well, now, uh, I've got to admit I'm inclined to agree with you there uh, even though I am a member of the N R A, B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: and they are they, their reason being that well, if you let one little law get through, pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another, and so forth and so on. B: Right. B: Yeah, B: I understand that. A: And you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way. B: Uh-huh, B: that's true. No, Get out my orange golf ball and go out. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: that's what they do here sometimes. A: You hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there A: but, if you got, B: Okay. A: So what do you, uh, think is the, uh, the worst culprit for air pollution? B: Well, I think it's, it's probably a combination of things. B: Um, factories that, that burn coal as a, an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants, you know, B: and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain, B: and I think that's, that's probably hurting us a little bit. B: It's hurting, you know, it's hurting Germany, for example, too, and some other parts of Europe where they, where they have high industry. B: So we're not the lone ranger here. A: Yeah. A: I, uh, I, A: it's hard to put the finger on, uh, what's worse, you know, the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion, um, with, uh, your hydrocarbons, uh causing the damage in which, B: Yeah. B: Hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit, B: but I know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot. A: Well, I notice on one of these, uh, home shopping networks they were selling these, uh, halogen, uh, fire extinguishers B: Yeah. A: and the halogen is, uh, an ozone depleter, A: and it got hydrocarbons in there. A: It's a very clean, uh, fire extinguisher, A: but it's, you know, really bad on the environment. B: Yeah. B: Huh. B: Yeah, B: I guess I missed that one. B: Uh. A: Yeah. B: Automobiles of course are contributing, too, B: and, you know, how, how we are with our love affair with the auto A: Yeah. B: kind of hard to do anything about that, I guess. A: I know, A: uh, in the Twin Cities area, A: I just moved out of there and was kind of happy I timed it just right, A: but they had a new policy where in order to get your, uh, your license, uh, your car license, uh, renewed, you had to meet the pollution standards B: Yeah. A: and, uh. B: We have that here, too, B: but it's part of the inspection sticker, you know, B: they put a probe in your exhaust pipe B: and, and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out, B: and so that's, you know, that's the way they're dealing with it here. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, uh, A: yeah A: I guess that was just mainly in the cities there, A: and as far as where I live, I don't have to do that, A: but I have an old car which I doubt would, uh, would, uh, pass the inspection, a seventy-six, B: Yeah. A: and, uh, you know, there's no way I would put in a lot of money to, to repair it to meet standards. B: Yeah. B: It'd probably be difficult anyway. A: Yeah. A: So, although I do what I can to, to cut down pollution, A: but, uh. B: I was just reading an article in, uh, MOTHER EARTH NEWS, MOTHER EARTH NEWS magazine A: Yeah. B: and, uh, they've got a new, uh, B: you know a lot of places are burning wood A: Yeah. B: a lot, a lot of people are burning wood, B: those of us who have, B: I've got a place in the country, you know A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, they've had catalytic you know, catalytic converters on those, on, B: uh, I think they're required in California and Oregon and, and Washington, B: but they've had up those for quite a while, B: and somebody's come up with a new one that, uh, sort of, B: it's a, it's a catalytic converter, B: it's, it's a plate that fits in, you know, into the smoke pipe A: Yeah. B: and, uh, apparently it sort of feeds itself. B: The more smoke is produced, you know, B: after you get to like five hundred degrees, the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is. B: And it sounds real neat. B: I haven't seen them priced anywhere yet, B: but that, that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on you know, old, old, uh, older stoves that don't have any kind of E P A requirements on them. A: Yeah. B: That might help a little bit, especially in some places. B: We're really lucky here. B: We have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out. A: Yeah. B: Now sometimes we get a kind of a, B: especially in, in, uh, autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us, B: but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well. A: Yeah. B: Probably blowing up there to you guys A: Yeah, A: well, well around here I, we get, uh, A: well it depends, you know, A: either in the, in the winter time it, it blows it your way, A: and in the summer time we probably get yours. B: Yeah. B: It comes back. B: Yeah. B: I really think, uh, you know, we're doing some, some important things. B: Education, raising consciousness awareness, B: uh, I know school kids, B: I work for the school district here, B: and, uh, you know, this is one of the big things with kids. B: Kids are writing letters to the newspapers about, you know, telling adults to clean up their act A: Yeah. B: and, it's uh, you know, B: I hope we're not too late with it. B: We're, we're, uh, we're having all kinds of recycling. A: Yeah, A: well, it, uh, that's a big thing, too. A: I know it has nothing to do with air pollution, A: but I kind of look at the way people treat our, A: Surprised they get anybody this time of day A: but, I've been trying all different times, B: Uh-huh. A: but I don't get anybody at five thirty, don't get anybody at nine at night A: so thought, I'll try , B: Oh, well, I'm at, work B: and I just happened to walk back into my office. A: Oh B: I've been gone for a little while A: Oh. A: Well, I go to school A: so I'm home certain days, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, I really haven't been making any phone calls, have you? A: Got, B: I don't, I haven't ever made any. B: I just receive them A: Oh A: Have you, have you received many? B: I haven't here lately. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: It's, it's, uh, A: well, the first time we were on this it came just about every day. B: Yeah. A: I never had to make one. A: They just always came B: Yeah. B: Exactly. A: People must be tired of it or something. A: well anyway I guess we're supposed to discuss this, uh, subject, A: what do you think? B: Well, I never gave it any thought myself B: I was hoping you could tell me what you thought. A: Oh. A: Well, I don't have any objection to people doing that. A: I think it might be good for them. B: Uh-huh. A: But as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent. B: Exactly. A: I'm just concerned about their safety B: Uh-huh. A: because if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: And if they were sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait worried, you know. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: That, that would be my main objection. I don't think, B: Uh-huh. B: I don't know B: I think maybe it's, it should stay on a voluntary basis A: it will probably never happen A: but, B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I, I think it would be good for, uh, everyone to do something like that B: but I, I guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon you. A: Yeah, A: well it, it probably won't. B: Uh-huh. A: I don't, I don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway. A: We can't, uh seem to pay for all the little things we have going now B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: That's another consideration B: Exactly A: But, uh, I don't know A: some kids are so spoiled nowadays A: it might be a real eye opener, you know B: Really A: I mean, sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here A: and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes A: and then they think, A: they're just kind of shocked at that side of town, you know B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl B: I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while A: Oh A: Well that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it? B: Wouldn't it though? A: I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country. B: Uh-huh, B: it is. A: I know. A: Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world, and helping some countries I never even heard of. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: I know it. A: It seems to me we are, A: it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country. Right on our borders. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: But, what do I know, right? A: I'm just sitting at home and, and, uh, doing laundry today and certainly not up, A: nobody has called me from Washington A: Oh, but, uh, anyway, how did you get on this program? B: I work at T I. A: Oh, you do work at T I? A: Oh, you're in Lewisville. B: Uh-huh. A: Oh, yeah. A: I just went by that place. A: We were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost A: and, uh we went by. A: That's the first time I'd seen it. A: It looked really nice. B: Yeah. A: A lot of trees there. A: It looked like a pretty little, a sight. B: Hang on a minute. A: Sure. B: to someone in the No, B: I don't think so, B: Yeah, B: Patty might. B: I'm back. A: Oh, sure. B: But how did you get on it? A: Well, my husband works at T I over on Central. B: Oh. A: Uh, why we're living in Arlington I'm not so sure A: but, he works over there A: and A: we did it last time. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, so I'm, just my daughter and I are registered this time. A: I don't know, A: they didn't even ask him back B: Really? A: That was weird, wasn't it? B: Huh. A: But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time. B: Uh-huh. B: I don't get too many. A: And I can never find anybody. B: Huh. A: So, um, B: The first time I used to get calls from far away too. A: Right. B: Like Maryland, and New Jersey, A: Uh-huh. B: and but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from. A: Yeah, A: I've had the same experiences, B: Uh-huh. A: all right around here. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I don't know, uh, A: I wonder if they really, A: I don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents. A: There's just, there's so many with this one town you know. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: even in some families some people talk a little bit different. B: Oh, yeah. B: Yeah. A: My husband is from New Jersey A: and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me A: and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way, A: and that's one family, right? A: Of course, I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny A: but B: Oh, I agree. A: You know, how that goes B: Oh, shoot. A: Oh, God. A: Well, I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet. A: Sometimes she says at night. Or, or or overloads B: Yeah. A: so please end your conversation. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: Right. A: Well, do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject? B: No, B: I sure don't A: You don't have any kids you want to send over here? B: No, B: no kids A: Well, is B: Oh, shoot. A: Well, uh, I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto. A: Well, one of them is real idealistic, A: she might B: My sister is, B: I'd be more suited to that than her B: she's just bugs, B: Okay, B: you ready? A: Yeah, A: is that it? B: That's it. A: Okay, A: Uh, well, we, I guess we have to talk about magazines A: and, uh, what, what, B: What, what kind do you subscribe to or do you? A: Well, I subscribe to well, I did subscribe to PEOPLE for a long time. A: I do, you know, A: I enjoy PEOPLE. A: And now I'm, uh, I, uh, subscribe to, uh, LADIES HOME JOURNAL. B: I, uh, take a computer magazine. And, uh, also, uh, BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS. A: Uh-huh. A: Okay, A: are you interested in, in computers? B: And my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside. And the cardboard pages A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah, A: well, that, that would be one of my peeves. A: My pet peeves with magazines, the woman's magazines especially, A: I mean, it's, it's really geared to, A: all they have, A: you have too many recipes first of all. A: I just don't, you know, A: that's what I don't like about LADIES HOME JOURNAL magazines. A: Too many recipes, too many, uh, can this marriage with saved nonsense. A: I, you know, I like to read articles about things that matter. A: Well, of course, PEOPLE magazine is not, you know, one of your, uh, your more intellectual magazines, A: but it's nice, light reading A: You know, if I want something intellectual, I usually read a book. B: Well, that's true. B: I, uh, I like it when they have short stories. B: Like REDBOOK used to always have a good short story in it. A: Well, that's true, A: yeah, A: they did. B: And I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while B: so I guess A: Yeah. B: I, I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore A: Well, is REDBOOK still in existence? A: I don't know if they're, if they're around anymore. B: Yeah B: I think it is. B: it's an institution, B: surely it would have to be. A: Yeah. B: But, A: Well, I'll tell you, the only reason I bought the, uh, I subscribe to the JOURNAL is because of, A: which I think it was either, A: yeah, A: it was Publisher's Clearinghouse B: Right A: They told me, you know, if I didn't subscribe they were going to take me off their, their winning, you know, their list A: So, B: Mine, too B: This was it, my last chance A: Yeah, A: my last, right, my last chance to win ten million dollars, A: so I figured, hey, look For twelve dollars, you know, B: Well, I, I, I went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that uh, to, uh, ENTERTAINMENT. A: That's it. A: Oh, yeah, A: oh, uh-huh. B: And I was real disappointed with it. A: Yeah. B: I, I don't know, B: it just, B: not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into. A: Right. B: It's little short articles more than anything else. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's one thing I don't like about PEOPLE. B: Uh, it 's just, you know, doesn't seem to have enough story to it. A: Well, I don't know, A: I just think, uh, you know, it's, It's light reading. B: If you've only got a short time to read A: You know, you don't have, well, you don't have to concentrate, you know you know. B: No, B: that's true A: It's entertaining, you know, A: and, uh, that's, A: I just, I enjoy it, A: I, you know, I, uh A: Well, that ENTERTAINMENT is, is very, A: wasn't that similar, or isn't it similar to, to the TV GUIDE? B: Uh, no, B: not really. B: I mean, not the one I take now. B: It's a, it's a magazine B: and it goes into all the movies, previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes. A: Oh, uh-huh. A: Oh, I see. B: And, uh, I'm a real movie buff, B: so that's why I thought I might be interested in it, B: but it just hasn't been what I thought it would be. A: Oh, uh-huh. B: And, uh, my mother has subscribed to, is the reason I get, uh, the HOME JOURNAL and the, uh, computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me. A: Oh. B: Otherwise, if, if I really want to take the time to read a magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf, I'll pick it up then. Rather than having them delivered and think, oh, I really need to read this A: Right, A: right. A: Well, I'll tell you, since I've been getting the JOURNAL, like maybe, maybe I'll read two, maybe three, A: if I read three articles in, in, you know, one of the JOURNALs, I figure, you know, I did really well. B: Yeah, A: Because there's just nothing in there that interests me. A: I don't, you know, I don't, I'm not into, you know, recipes A: and B: Well, I, I do like recipes and crafts. A: See, now, and I'm not into crafts, A: so, you know, that, that eliminates, like three quarters of the magazine You know. B: That's true. A: Well, I just got the new issue, A: they have Bette Midler on the cover, A: so that should be one article that I'll read anyway B: Do you, uh, A: So, how is the weather out there? B: Uh, it's really cold B: and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold B: and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had. A: Oh, really? B: You have, breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff. B: How about you guys? A: Um. Uh, it's just, it's a, it's about same. A: The usual, I think. B: Oh. A: So, nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff A: It's good. B: Yeah, B: well the weather, let's see, well, the snow here is different from Utah's, B: because I have lived in Utah for like ten years. A: Oh, really? A: What part? B: And, uh, B: Provo. B: I was going to B Y U. A: Oh, really? A: Okay. B: Yeah. B: And, uh, the snow is like, really cold. B: I mean, it's, like, really humid B: so it seems wetter or something like that. B: It's, A: It's more humid in Utah than there? B: Uh-huh. A: Or there? B: It's more humid in Iowa than Utah. A: Okay. A: Right. B: Yeah. A: Okay. B: And it seems like when the winds blow, it's really, it goes right through you. B: It's really different from Utah's weather. B: I thought Utah was cold, B: but I think Iowa is a lot colder A: Yeah, A: see, that's how it is in Texas, too A: because when it's cold, it's really cold. A: So, B: Yeah, B: I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind A: What's that? B: I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind. A: Right. A: Yeah. A: So the humidity is I think what does it B: Yeah, B: I think that's true. A: Because I, I noticed when I got here, too, A: because like I'd, A: when it would snow in Texas uh, I would just, I mean we'd be really cold B: Uh-huh. A: and we'd have to get really warm, A: and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing A: and you don't you don't feel super cold. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: that's true. A: It was weird. B: Yeah. A: But, so how long ago did you graduate? A: Or did you, A: or, B: Uh, I graduated in nineteen eighty-seven. A: Oh, really? B: Yeah, B: my husband got his doctorate at B Y U, B: so that's, B: and so he just graduated this past year. A: Oh. A: So you just barely moved away? B: Uh-huh B: Yeah, Well, we really miss Utah A: Do you like it out there? B: We miss the mountains. A: You do? A: Yeah. B: Because it's, like, really flat here B: Well, not flat, but hilly. B: But no big mountains or anything. A: Uh-huh. A: So you just moved away a year ago? B: Uh, in August. A: Wow, really recent. B: Yeah. B: But, uh, see, see what else can I say about the weather. B: Uh, well, today was warmer B: It was like forty-five A: Oh, warm B: So, what's the temperature up today over there? A: Oh, man, A: it's got to be like, it's probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe. B: Oh, really? A: Maybe not that warm. A: Probably about, uh, A: yeah. A: It's not, it's not that cold, really. B: And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah, I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill. A: Yeah. B: But they talk about wind chill here all the time. A: Yeah, A: that's a big deal in Texas, too. B: They said it could be, like, six degrees out and, like, negative forty-one wind chill. A: Um. B: So, that's what we're not used to A: Yeah, A: that's true. A: That makes a big difference. Huh. B: So, oh, I, A: So, did you used to ski when you were out here? B: What's that? A: Did you used to ski when you were in Utah? B: Oh, I've only, I've only skied in Utah once. A: Oh, really? B: I only skied once my whole life B: But, do you do a lot of skiing there? A: Uh, not tons, A: but I like to when I get a chance. B: Uh-huh. A: I've only been once so far, but had the opportunity a couple times since then. A: Just saving my money for Christmas things and that. B: Yeah. B: So is this your first year in Utah? A: Uh, no, A: this is actually my third year. B: And you're going to school there? A: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: Yep. B: At U of U, B: or, A: No, A: at B Y U. B: Oh, really? A: Yeah. B: Oh. A: So, but, I'll be here a long time at this rate. B: What's your major? A: Uh, it was nursing, A: but I'm in the process of changing it right now. B: Uh-huh, B: oh. A: Because it's really, really competitive at B Y U. B: Yeah. A: You have to have like a three seven to get in A: so, It's really, B: That's true. A: I'm going to look into some other fields. A: I'd like, A: all the science classes and that, I'm just not really enjoying too much A: so I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school B: Uh-huh. A: so, B: Yeah, B: that's, that's a good idea. A: Did you graduate in a certain field A: or, B: Uh, education. B: I got a double major. A: In, B: Uh, elementary and special ed. A: Really? B: Uh-huh. A: That what my sister did. B: Oh, really? A: Yeah, A: you might know her. A: Here name is Lori, Bird. A: Maybe not A: I think she graduated around then, too, though, eighty-seven probably, A: but, she got her B: Yeah, B: well, I can't, B: there are so many girls in all my classes, B: I can't remember how many people. A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: Because they, since, uh, stopped that program. I mean, where you can where you can get it double pretty easily. B: Oh, have they? B: Oh. A: I mean, it's, it's really, A: We're set. B: Okay. A: What changes do you feel have happened? B: Oh, I guess the first thing has been the, uh, for the right, for women to vote. B: I think that has been a major change and also the fact that, uh, there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were B: and that's probably going to increase. You know. A: Right. A: Increases each year, doesn't it? B: I'm sorry? A: It increases each year I think. B: It sure does. B: Yeah, B: there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays. A: Well, and I think women have kind of had, uh, in the past the real subservient role. B: Role? B: Right. A: And, uh, B: That's changing A: Well, we do to some degree B: Right. A: but, uh, uh, I think it's not as much as it was. B: Right, B: yeah, B: I, I agree. B: It definitely has changed. A: I, And especially, I think with women increasingly working, they're going to have to demand more from men. B: Uh-huh. A: Because there is just, impossible to keep up on everything else. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active role in taking care of the home. B: Well, you know, they've been talking about B: and I don't know, uh, what the status is on it, B: but, you know, women get maternity leave and stuff like that B: and I know that they've, there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out, A: Right. B: but you know, I haven't really heard much about that recently. A: Well, you know, there is a lot of companies that won't give women maternity leave for that very reason. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, in fact, I know the school districts down here, you, they don't have maternity leave. A: Uh you simply have to take, accumulate your sick leave. And take your sick leave. B: Oh, is that right? B: Oh. B: Uh-huh. A: And I don't know, uh, if bigger company companies do, A: but when I was employed with the school district, I didn't have maternity leave either A: and that was the reason A: because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men A: but, So, uh, B: Huh, that's interesting. B: That's a bummer, though A: Yeah A: it is. B: I mean, You got to take the time off A: You have to save all of your, uh, vacation time. A: You do. A: You have to save all your vacation time A: and that's usually how it's, uh, happened, B: Yeah. A: but, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: What do you see, uh, changing in the future? B: I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies, uh, run by females. A: Right, A: and, and top level. B: And we'll B: I'm sorry? A: Maybe top level. B: Right, B: right, B: upper management, B: more women in upper management B: and probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles. B: More governors and, I think, you know, roles like that. A: That would be kind of nice B: Well, we've got, in Texas, we have a female governor. A: That's right, A: that's right. B: And we had a female mayor here in Dallas, B: and she just, her term just ended B: and, uh, so I think we're probably going to see more of that in the future A: Yeah A: I think that's probably good. A: A little more integration. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners A: and, B: Right, you know, B: I mean, and that's fine with me A: I think, B: but sometimes, B: I mean I'm not a women's libber by any means, B: but I do, A: Right. B: there are issues that, you know, as far as, like, equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff, I totally am for. A: Right. B: But, I don't get into the, uh, the real women libber movement, you know. A: No, A: I don't either. A: I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal B: Yeah. A: We just function differently B: Right, B: right. A: And, uh, I'm not capable of lifting what, uh, a man can lift and you know, that type of, that type of thing, B: Yeah. A: but, uh one of the big changes, uh, they're doing in Salt Lake is, uh, B: Right. A: and they're probably, A: I'm sure, in Dallas since you're big places, a lot more women are, uh, working right out of their home with their P C's or with their lap computers or whatever. B: Yeah, B: I, I've heard of that. B: Uh, I haven't really talked to anybody that's, you know, too involved with that. B: But, I mean, I think that is a, A: I think that, B: Like the cottage industry. B: Is, is that what you're talking about, women working out of their homes? A: Right. B: Yeah, B: uh, I think it's wonderful A: Right. A: You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week A: and, B: Yeah. A: Course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that, B: Oh, I B: By the phone and all that. A: so, uh, it would be kind of exciting in some ways to, to see a little bit more of that A: and some ways, it might be kind of scary. B: Right. A: Think anybody could do it, A: but, Anyway, B: Right. B: Yeah, B: I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up A: Right. A: Right, A: but then you know, there is the process of selection. A: Would you have to give them the brand You know, when you shop, you usually compare the prices B: Right. B: Right. A: and, would be nice, though. A: How big is Provo? B: Um. A: That a little town or, or a bigger city? B: Um, it's not one of the bigger ones. It's probably, um, I compare it to the size of Plano, maybe a little smaller. B: Plano, Texas. No *nn A: Oh. A: I talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town, I think. A: Yeah, A: I forgot the name of the town. A: I thought maybe it was you A: Oh, well, anyway, we're supposed to talk about education. A: I certainly have some ideas since I'm studying it now in college. A: I'd say, first of all, they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading, writing, arithmetic in grade school, B: Uh-huh. A: because they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to, A: and it shows up. A: That's one idea. A: Do you have any? B: Um, I don't know, B: I'm pretty, I think I'm pretty satisfied with, um, B: I I grew up in Plano A: Uh-huh. B: and, and my dad is actually on the school board there, B: so, I kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on. A: Yeah, A: it's A: Plano, uh, improved greatly in the last twenty, twenty-five years B: Yeah. A: that's for sure. A: It used to be the pits. A: And Arlington is excellent now, A: but I'm just speaking overall across the country. B: Oh. B: Yeah. A: Something is definitely wrong. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, one thing, they don't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing, A: so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year A: and they truly can't read B: Right. A: so I don't know how they expect them to, uh, pass history when they can't read anything, you know, even read a word problem in math. A: So, um, that's definitely a problem. A: Another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do. B: Right. A: But, um, B: So do you, what do you think is good about the schools? A: That is good about, A: well, it depends on where you are. A: They're all so different. A: That's another thing about the United States. B: Yeah. A: There's no national curriculum, you know, A: I mean, what they'd be teaching in an Arlington school they may not be teaching in a Plano school B: Uh-huh. A: and in the same school district, you may, even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance, you may have an English class A: you may have half literature for the whole year, A: whereas in another one they're going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature, B: Grammar. A: it's up to the teacher, in other words. A: So that's kind of you know, that's kind of odd to me. B: Yeah. A: It depends on, uh, what school you're in and who your teacher is, actually B: Uh-huh. A: or is how you end up A: Overall, Arlington is good, one of the better ones in the state, A: so I guess we lucked out when we moved here. B: Uh-huh. B: So, yeah, B: that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. A: Uh-huh. A: Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point, A: and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum? A: I don't know. A: I just read about that the other day, A: and I had never even thought of it. A: Actually it makes sense to a certain extent, A: because sometimes, like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what, uh, A: they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach, you know. and according to her plan, B: Uh-huh. A: so I guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn. B: Right. A: But, uh. We actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes, you know. B: Um. A: That's, that's pretty low that there's forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more more citizens percentage wise that can read and write, B: Yeah. A: so, um, unless we want to keep paying, paying for these people that can't make it in society, we're going to have to do something. A: I don't know. A: Obviously nobody's smart enough to have figured it out yet, A: so I probably can't A: But I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five, six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write A: because they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know. B: Right. A: Uh, you can't, you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something you know, or fill out an application to work at McDonalds if you can't read. B: Uh-huh. Yeah *aa A: So, uh, I think that's, that's a start at least, going back to the basics in the early grades A: and, um, they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago, A: and that's a big jump. B: I believe that A: Did you go to school in Plano? B: I did. A: Through high school. B: Uh-huh, B: uh, A: Up, up there, maybe, maybe you guys don't have as, uh, big a problem with air pollution as many, do you? B: We, we, we have a terrible air pollution problem. A: Do you really? B: Our summers are extremely, uh, hazardous A: Uh-huh. B: and during, uh, certain wind directions because we get the, uh, Gary, Indiana Chicago pollution A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze, uh coming up along the lake. A: That's horrible. A: Uh-huh. B: And they do post, uh, uh, warnings for people who have, uh, heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season. A: Uh-huh. B: In the winter it's not as severe. A: Right. B: But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't think it's going to go very far, B: but it, it was, uh, a way of, uh, triggering, uh, awareness. A: Right, A: right. B: So what's the conditions like in Dallas? A: Well, uh, in Dallas, I, I haven't seen air pollution quite on a, quite on a level that we had in Denver. A: I grew up in Denver, A: and, and I've lived there most of my life, A: and we used to have those, uh, you know, the posted warning days. A: Uh, however, in Colorado now, they have the emissions control law, which has really cut down, A: probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now, you know, as far as health concerns. B: Um. A: Uh, due to that the, the emissions, uh, uh, control on the vehicles, seems that all of our, all of our, uh, smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry. B: Wisconsin has a, a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for, uh, their pollution control equipment, A: Uh-huh. B: and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it, it is drivable. A: Um. B: So, they've, they've tried to do a lot of that A: Uh-huh. B: and I B: you know, there seem to be, at least in certain little pockets, B: and we were talking earlier about Madison A: Uh-huh. B: Madison has one of the nicest, uh, bike, uh, road, uh, sharing programs of, of any city in Wisconsin A: Oh, really. B: and all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of, uh, bike trails for recreational use of any of the states. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And there is a, a real promotion of, of biking A: Uh-huh. B: but, um, there are still a lot of people who insist on, on driving their own automobiles uh, to go everywhere. A: Right. B: I find that a little irritating, because I don't think it's always so necessary. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: it, it becomes, uh, A: maybe to you and I who have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, I think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware, uh, rather quickly of, of what's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is. A: Um, I, I notice people in, in Dallas seem to say, Well, sure, there's air pollution, but, you know, really, how bad is, how bad could this problem really be. B: Send, send them to Wisconsin, B: and we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from, uh, the, uh, acid rain A: Oh really A: Uh-huh. B: and they'll, they'll, they may wake up, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: how'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain. A: Right. A: Right. B: It's, uh, really a serious issue for those of us up in this, uh, sector up, up here. A: Do you find that, um, or, or do you hypothesize that, that most of the, uh, smog or, or air pollution comes from vehicles A: or does it come mostly from industry up there? B: I think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of, of the Gary area A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: that causes the acid rain. B: That I'm a little uncertain of, B: but I do know that, uh, it is a problem. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: I had talked with my parents. A: I, I grew up, uh, I was born in, uh, Muncie, Indiana, and, and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute, A: and I had asked them before, uh, A: I went back to visit recently, about a year ago, A: and I asked them, A: I said, did you ever realize the air pollution that was, A: I'm sorry, um B: That's okay, B: I didn't hear. A: hobbies. B: Okay. A: Let me see, A: I don't know if that took or not, A: I'll do it again. B: Okay. A: Okay. A: What are your hobbies? A: I hear you have kids, right? B: You heard her in the background B: That's babies. A: That's your full time, uh, hobby, right? B: Takes a lot of time, huh. B: I like, uh, most sports. B: I like to do that. B: I kind of like to do a little bit of sewing. A: Uh-huh. B: Oh, little bit of embroidery work, once in a while. A: Uh-huh. B: What do you like to do? A: Um, I try to do some painting, although I'm not very good at it B: Well, I'm sure you probably are. A: Well, no, A: not really. B: You like it, B: that's the main . A: Yeah, A: I, I have, you know, I inherited the genes that make me think I'm creative, but not the ones that give me the ability to be. B: That's right. A: So, I always try. A: I, I do some sewing, mostly out of necessity. A: Um, I'm making drapes for my house, just because I'm, B: Oh, boy, that's hard sewing. A: Yeah, A: well, it isn't and it is. A: It is, you know, A: actually the sewing isn't the hard part, A: it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room. B: Measure it and get it to, B: Well, if it, it depends on how elaborate you get it. B: If you get pleats and all kinds of, A: Yeah, A: I've been doing that A: and, That, B: That's a lot of work. A: yeah, A: that, A: but usually have to do the pleats by hand. A: So that, at least I can do, you know, watching T V or whatever B: Oh. A: but, B: Right, B: right. A: Yeah, A: and I've, I've gone and, you know, put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through A: but, B: That feels really good. A: Yeah, A: so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything, but I, I need to do it. B: To do it, B: right. A: I have, let's see, I have a dog, and a lot of fish. A: Keeping fish, I guess is my biggest hobby. B: Keeping fish . B: Well, they're probably easier than keeping dogs, though, aren't they. A: Um, yes and no. A: It depends on how frequently they die, and how much that bothers you. B: Oh, no. B: How much that bothers you, B: and you probably have to clean out the tank too. A: That's, A: you don't have to do as much as, as I thought. A: In fact, my problem, A: I had fish as a kid A: and they always died immediately, B: Oh, no. A: and, what, I'm, what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean B: Oh, you're kidding A: because you have, B: because they need to have a little bit of the, A: Right, A: you need to let the bacteria build up, A: and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance. B: I see. A: And I would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water B: Oh, no. A: and it would kill all the bacteria, A: and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again B: And so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably. A: so. A: Right. A: That's right. A: So now only, I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing B: Right, B: right. A: and I don't try and sterilize things B: Don't go through the whole nine yards B: and they kind of need a little bit of that. A: That's right. A: That's right. B: So you've had fish for a long time. A: Well, I've had them, A: I guess it's been two years now I've had a, a tank here, A: and then back at home I used to have a small, you know, five gallon tank. A: But that never worked well. I have fifty-five gallons now. *sd B: What size do you have now? B: Oh, that's a good size. A: It's a lot easier. B: Have you ever had it, uh, crack or break or leak. A: No A: No, A: not yet. B: Fifty-five gallons, you'd hope it would never do that. A: That's right, A: I really do. A: But, you know. B: Do you have all kinds of different fish B: or, A: Yeah, A: I just have, you know, what they call community fish guppies, and platies and, and basic things. B: Uh-huh. A: I don't get into the B: Real exotic. A: right, A: right. A: The expensive ones. B: Well, they're probably hardy, harder to take care of B: and, A: They are. A: They're very expensive A: and, you know, when you die, it's like, when they die it's more like an investment. B: Yes, B: I bet it is. A: You lost an investment A: so, B: Do you have problems with them, uh, the fish eating each other? A: No, A: not really. A: Only if there's baby fish. B: Right. A: You always have to isolate those. B: Then you have to, B: how do you isolate them? A: You get a B: A jar or something B: or. A: well, no, A: they have breeders. B: Okay. A: It's a little plastic things that sort of floats B: Okay. A: and you put the mother fish in there A: and then it's got like a trough underneath her B: Okay. A: so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough A: and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either. B: Oh. A: And that's, you know, A: it kind of works, A: but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate B: Right. A: it'll fit out the slots. B: It'll go through the slot. A: That's right, A: so. But, you know, it works, I guess. B: That works all right then. B: They don't, uh, want the mothers to be with the little fish either. A: Oh, they'll eat them. B: They will. A: Yeah. B: Isn't that odd. A: Yes. B: You wouldn't think that. A: It, and it's funny because the one I have, every single month without fail she has babies. B: You're kidding. A: Oh, no. A: All the time, A: and, um, I, A: and she's supposed to, A: her variety, it says they won't eat the babies, A: and I've seen her do it. A: So. B: And that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it? A: Oh, it's A: well, it makes you understand that, you know, things are different B: Things are different in the animal kingdom, huh. A: We might, right. We might decide what's proper and what isn't, A: but you know, that's the way it is for them. B: Yeah. B: That's kind of the way they do it. A: Yeah. A: That's it. B: Survival of the fittest or something. A: Yes, A: because if the baby is strong enough, it can swim away fast enough and go hide. B: Right. B: Go hide from them, B: well and then, you think, well, how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that, A: So. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: but. If you're like me, you never have enough time for the hobbies. A: No, A: not really. A: I, I try. A: I also, I play a couple of instruments. A: Uh, well, uh, the Cowboys are my favorite team. A: That's pretty easy to say nowadays A: Lot easier than it was a couple years ago, A: but they had a big win today. A: Uh, did you get to watch it? B: No, B: I didn't. B: I, uh, have been at my computer all day B: so, A: Oh. A: Are you a Cowboy fan? B: Well, I used to be a real big Cowboy fan B: and, and, uh, I'm not a Jimmy Johnson fan. B: Being an Okie I just really don't care much, uh, A: Right, A: yeah. B: it's, it's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan, though. A: Uh-huh. B: They've always been, you know, my favorite. A: Right. B: But, uh, and and I guess I still have a soft spot. A: Yeah. B: I just hate that that's the coach that's leading them. A: Right. A: Right. B: So, now have they, B: they're in the playoffs, right? A: Yeah, A: they made it to the playoffs finally A: like just, you know, two years ago they were one and fifteen. A: They won like just one game A: and so pretty fast turnaround. A: But this year they made it to playoffs A: and today was the first game A: and they beat the Chicago Bears A: so everybody's really going crazy, you know, down here. B: I'll bet they are. A: They're going crazy, A: so, so they turned it around, A: but, you know, they have a lot of young exciting players now, uh, A: I mean, everybody was real upset, you know, when they fired Tom Landry, A: but, you know, now it's like, you know, they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that. B: Uh, football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world. A: Uh-huh. B: Hit a bad season B: and it's, you know, the coach's fault, B: let's, let's dump him. A: Right. B: First good season, the coach can do no wrong. A: Right, A: exactly. You know. B: But they Dallas has always been good ahead, you know, heading good players and both running, running backs and, and defense. A: Uh-huh. A: Right, A: yeah, A: uh, you know, they have a young team. A: It's, you know, a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old, you know, players every year and, you know, same coach, same everything, A: so, now it's, you know, like a taste of something different. A: They're all not, you know, mister nice guys like they used to be. A: Now it's like, you know, tough and dirty team A: so everybody is really excited. A: And, B: Who is the competition going to be? A: Well, it's supposed to be the Redskins, but you know, we beat them already. A: We beat them this year in, in Washington A: so, you know, so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl, A: but, you know, it's just that we have to play every game away, you know, A: it's going to be tough, A: but, but A: the competition is, are teams that they've already beat this year, A: so, I mean, Atlanta, they're in it, too, A: and we beat them A: and, uh, see, Detroit, we play them next week, A: but, you know, we should beat them. A: Everybody feels like we should be able to beat them A: so, it's, so everything's, uh, looking real good. B: Course, I think, you know, you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season injuries that heal A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: and, you know it can be a or injuries that, uh, have newly happened and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played. A: Right. A: Right. A: Yeah, A: well the Cowboys are on a roll. A: They've won, like, I think six or seven in a row now, A: so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the, in the league going into the playoffs A: so, B: But, but since you have an O U drop out as a quarterback, A: Right, A: yeah, A: Troy Aikman, A: he got hurt at O U, A: so he transferred to U C L A. B: Well, Well, he, he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at O U. A: Right. B: O U has always been known for their running game. A: Uh-huh. B: More than, A: They're playing tonight in fact. B: Right. A: I'm watching them on T V right now. A: But they're doing some stomping on Virginia. B: Oh, I tell you, B: they've, they've not had much of a team this year, bless their little hearts A: Really? A: Well, they're doing good tonight. B: Are they? A: Yeah B: I haven't been watching. A: they're winning. They're winning forty-one to seven. B: Well, good for us A: Yeah. A: Right. B: Oh. A: But, yeah, A: and, uh, that's right, A: Aikman did go to O U. A: I forgot about that. B: Yeah, B: they B: then he went out to S, to southern Cal. B: Is that where he went? A: Yeah, A: uh, U C L A. B: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: So, A: But, the Cowboys did good today. A: I mean, I was proud. A: I thought, I thought they would get beat today because, I mean they're so young, you know, A: playoffs, A: You bet. A: They tell you our topic? B: Uh, pets. A: You've got it. B: Do you have pets? A: Yes, A: we do. A: Uh, my wife and I have a dog that soon be eight years old, A: and we have a, a cat, which is, uh, I guess about five years old. B: Oh, my goodness. A: How about you guys? B: We have three dogs and two birds at this point. A: Three dogs. A: And two A: what kind of birds do you have? B: Parakeets. A: No, kidding. A: enjoy them? B: Oh, have a ball with them. A: You let them out and let them fly around and everything? B: Well, no, B: because my dogs chase them. A: Okay. B: So in order to have the birds not stuffed I have to keep them in their cages. A: You know, this is like a cruelty joke, A: and I apologize if you're a bird lover, A: but, uh, we had a parakeet. And, my fault, put up our first electric fan. And never thought about it. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: Knocked that parakeet right out of the air. B: Well, we had that happen once, um, B: my son had the bird back in his room, B: because it's his well, the first one that we had was his bird, B: and I had a ceiling fan put up, B: and it, the bird got away from him one afternoon, B: and I mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall, B: I thought, oh so much for the bird. A: It killed him? B: No, B: he's still alive and kicking. A: Oh, that's, A: well, it killed ours, A: I'll be darned. B: No, B: I guess we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit in just the right spot, B: but it threw him up against the wall, you know, B: and he slid down the wall. Oh, I hate them. *sd A: Well, speaking of pets, I'll tell you, my, my kids are older now, A: my, both of them are either in or out of college, A: but, but we had for years, about five years I guess, had a, my son had a Burmese boa constrictor, A: and that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in, in length, A: and finally my wife, wife, bless her heart, got rid of it, because perhaps, um, a lot of, she gets protected a lot because it's almost like a token. B: Oh. A: And, and it's sort of unfortunate because, I think that they don't accept her technically A: and, but she's a good paper pusher. B: Uh-huh. A: And it's in a technical position really. A: And you know she should be more technical for what she does. B: Uh-huh. A: And I think that's sort of unfortunate, because it doesn't, it doesn't really help the cause in the long run B: Right. A: But, um, you know, I don't know. A: And, and teaching I still see that that's where most of the woman are. B: In teaching. A: In teaching. A: And, you know, and it's always been that way. B: But not at the college level. A: Right. A: Not, well, B: We live in a college town B: and I worked at the university for a while. A: Uh-huh. B: And there are, there are woman there B: but they're not the high paid professors that, the men are A: Uh-huh. A: Not department, chairmen. A: Yeah. A: Not the deans and things like that. B: Well, they did have one woman dean B: but, and I guess she, she probably did very well B: but that's the minority. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Um, and do you think it's because women aren't qualified or, or just don't, or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs. B: None of the above B: I think they are extremely well qualified. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't know how, A: They're just not selected somehow. B: I think they're not selected, A: Uh-huh. B: And, of course, at this university, uh, B: this, it's a big engineering school B: and I don't think there are many women in the engineering college. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's where the high pay is. A: Oh, okay. A: But I'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering. A: but, you know, I say that A: but yet I know too. B: Quite an, B: well, I think there are more than there used to be. A: Yeah, A: I'm sure there are, yeah. B: But they may not go into teaching, A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I mean, the two that I know obviously are not in teaching A: but, um, it's, I suppose in a since I was surprised when they told me they majored in engineering. B: Uh-huh. A: I don't know why. A: I, but I don't know that many men that have majored in engineering, either. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean it's just, because I'm in the humanities it's just, B: Oh, uh-huh A: You know, it's not, it's not something that I tend to hear about. B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: But, um, yeah, A: it's a, B: Well, I met one one day that, uh, had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering B: and that really surprised me. A: Oh, that's interesting, B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I mean, I, I suppose that, that it's difficult to really say why because, uh, you know, there, there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified. B: Uh-huh. A: And maybe there aren't, you know, A: Maybe they don't apply for the job. B: I don't know. B: I don't, I don't know how many go on and get a P H D in engineering. A: Right. A: Right. A: Which could be, you know, partially cultural anyway. B: That could be. B: That's true. A: So that it might be circularly being the same problem of, of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway, B: Uh-huh. A: so why spend your time getting qualified. B: That's right. A: It's a, it's a rough It's a rough, a rough situation. A: Um, and I guess what I, what, amazes me is the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids A: or and, in our case we actually have one father who works part-time, a six, hour day so that he can take the kids, kids or kid, I'm not sure, to school in the morning and be home when the children or child, comes home in the afternoon. B: Oh. B: That's interesting, B: Is it, uh, was she the major wage earner, A: This is, uh, B: I mean, did she earn more money that he did B: or you know. A: Well, see, I don't know anything about the family A: but, but, yeah, A: I would imagine she might. Um, A: because he's, you know, he's a really nice guy A: but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job. B: Oh, uh-huh. A: So that maybe he, you know, maybe she was more qualified. A: But, but still it's interesting that, you know, he, he's been doing this evidently for a, a good number of years. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, but it's unusual. B: Uh, I know one, uh, gal B: that's, she's a C P A, B: and her husband is a house husband. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah A: I, B: And then they had a child B: and he, he was still the house husband. B: He wasn't, going to, A: Oh, he was, even before they had children. B: Uh-huh. B: Even before that, B: right. A: Oh, now that, that really is B: She was a little perturbed about it. A: Oh, she was. B: At one time. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't know how, she's moved away. I don't know how it is now B: but I know, uh, we're, we all went out one evening B: and after work and, uh, she was, there was an underlying note she was perturbed about it. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I mean I think that would be, it would, it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for somebody to stay home that, B: Uh-huh. B: I don't think there was a valid reason A: Yeah A: That's true. B: Because her statement was, I told him let's face it B: you're a house husband B: that's what your going, that's what you'll always be. A: But, but yet, you know we have to think about that A: because if, if she had offered to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything B: She wouldn't have be, B: that's right. B: Uh-huh, B: that's right. A: So, so we're, carrying our own prejudice B: it would, it wouldn't have been a doubter . B: Uh-huh. B: That's true. A: Yeah. A: Oh, gee. A: I guess we can't win B: Huh-uh. B: Oh. A: Because if, yeah, if, if somebody does if and breaks tradition you're surprised. A: But if B: That's right A: Oh, dear. A: So, so, B: I think maybe more men would like to be if they weren't put down so badly A: If they could get away with it A: Oh, dear. A: You know, well, uh, I mean it, it's an interesting topic A: yet I must say it's not one that I've given a great deal of, of thought to B: Huh-uh. A: but, uh, in the past. B: No, B: I didn't. A: It's, um, one of those things that, you know, seems to happen. B: How do you feel your career has gone? A: I don't, I don't feel for the most part that I've been discriminated against. B: You don't. B: That's good. A: No. A: I was a department chairman. A: I, but I don't like administration. B: Oh. A: So then I'm, uh, uh, probably a poor example, although, you know, I was an administrator and could still be I suppose. B: Uh-huh. B: I was discriminated against very definitely in banking. A: Uh-huh. B: It was terrible. A: Oh, really. A: You were, you were more ambitious than they would let you be? B: Right. B: And the money didn't go with the positions. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Well, I would, B: The promotion, promotions came B: but there there comparable pay for the responsibility. A: Uh, B: And I was told you don't need as much pay as I have because your children are older than my children, B: or your husband has a good job B: and A: Oh, jeez. A: Yeah, A: actually in a since I suppose, when I was hired into the government, um, at, I was taken advantage of A: and, and that's true that, you know, sometimes other people get, get higher increments, for, you know, even, B: I B: uh-huh. B: I think we, uh, are programmed to just take it as it comes. A: Right. A: Right. A: That's probably true. A: I hadn't, I hadn't thought about it because I do like what I do A: and, uh, I just sort of ignore the administrative, part of it since I didn't like it when, when I had to do it. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: So I, I figure, you know, nobody must, uh, nobody must like it. A: It must be a rotten job for everybody A: But I know some people thrive on it A: Oh, gee. A: Well, since I don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic. B: I don't, A: Yeah, A: I think, um, this is a tough subject because, uh, when you come from two different parts of the country, uh, the political views are really different. A: I, uh, I, I guess I've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues, B: Uh-huh. A: I guess like, like they're nothing, I guess, nothing is as awful as abortion A: but like gun control and, uh, day care an things like that, A: and there are some very different views, uh, of the people connected with the program which I thought was really interesting, you know. B: Well, now you, you say two different parts of the country B: what, are, are, are you referring to yourself B: or, A: Yeah, A: well being in, in Baltimore see, A: Maryland is, um, is sort of, um, is as, as a hub of liberalism you know, compared to the country, uh, A: you know, very, uh, in, in many ways, uh, very liberal A: very somewhat to New England A: though Pennsylvania and New York, uh, I, aren't actually as liberal, A: Maryland is a very liberal, uh, state A: so, so, where here we have, um, we have gun control laws A: we probably have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation A: and most people in Maryland vote for that, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So, it really is a different, um, B: Uh, well, of course, you talk gun controls down here in Texas B: and you're asking to be lynched. A: Yeah, A: that's, that's right talk to, A: I had to talk about gun control with somebody A: and I talked with a woman who actually, you know, had just purchased a gun that day, and was going target shooting, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: and it was very different A: it was a whole, different view. A: It's really, um, this has opened my eyes to thinking, you know, A: at one time I just sat here and thought, well, how can anybody believe that A: because I'd really never met people that did, A: and now, I talk to people that do. A: So that's, it's really interesting. B: Well, it's very true, B: now I'm a, uh, New Yorker by birth. A: Uh-huh. B: Although I claim Florida as my home now, uh, B: I have two sons living down there B: but I also have two sons living elsewhere, one in Tennessee, one in Mississippi. A: Uh-huh. B: But I lived in in Florida for ten years B: and I kind of like it down there, B: but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far. A: Yeah. B: I think uh, B: well in your words, they were a little bit too liberal. A: Yeah, A: isn't it funny. B: I mean they they I believe if I'm correct I believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons. A: Uh-huh. B: But they uh quickly did away with it. A: Uh. A: Yeah. B: I think in the next session they they uh modified it B: but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh Florida. A: Yeah A: well you can possess 'em here too A: but They have to be they're registered A: and Uh, like uh the the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here, in gun control avenues, B: The the one week uh seven day the delay A: You have the seven day waiting period. B: Uh huh. A: Yeah B: Well I don't mind that too much A: that's uh that's B: I'm I'm with the N R A myself. A: Yeah. B: And uh, uh Really the only objection we have Is uh you you give a little B: and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more. A: Yeah A: that's true A: that's very true A: That's and that's the way I guess most of the um the political organizations work you know A: the same I know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose B: Yeah. A: and and both of them are both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know A: there's there's always that difficulty B: Well then tell me B: do you consider yourself a liberal? A: Um I would say I'm probably liberal A: yeah B: Well let me ask you this then. A: yeah A: Sure B: How is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag? A: Well I'll tell you. A: I I think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag, it would never happen A: do you know what I mean? B: Huh. A: It's only because they make a big stink over it. A: But I I guess actually I believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag I guess that's their opportunity A: They're they're they're right in the sense of freedom of speech A: But I would never B: Well now wait a minute there A: Yeah. B: you just said it. B: It's their right by freedom of speech? B: What does speech have to do with burning a flag? A: Yeah. A: Well it's A: that they A: I think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to A: and I uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your uh your ideas you know A: the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that Uh, A: though I would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself A: I I I think uh you know A: but I I still A: what the flag stands for I guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed A: uh B: Now uh Well I I still go back to ... A: Unless the burn unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know A: but I I think that's I guess that's I that's my opinion A: Yeah A: I guess you feel differently. B: Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building? A: Uh, no A: but I think that's that's uh it's that's taxpayer's money. A: If somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine A: but that that's you know that's destruction and of uh public property and whatever. B: Uh, then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh what a public uh symbol. A: No A: I don't know A: I guess the symbolism A: oh I think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government. B: Uh yeah A: Uh I think that's what's made democracy B: but here again I go back to the second amendment B: You can disagree by freedom of speech which, has nothing to do with action. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Well that's that's true B: Now I am I am adamantly against that. A: Yeah A: But I think I I A: Yeah A: I I I guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers. A: Um. there uh one of the Republican the appointees for the the judicial bench A: and they always talk about they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down. B: Uh-huh. A: And Um I believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in B: huh. A: my understanding of how it was framed is that you this the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government A: and you can display that. B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, I Yeah, A: I A: and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever I I think that that's viable. A: Um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point. I think. A: Yeah A: Because, realistically, like for you for you you don't think it's right B: No. A: And I would never do it. A: I I love this country too much, A: and that symbol means a lot to me. B: Uh-huh. A: Um. But I guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something it's a need for them you know. B: Well here again we uh B: even though you uh physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself. A: Yeah. A: Yes. A: No. B: Nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country. A: Right. A: Yeah. A: Uh huh. B: Uh, um so long as it's their possession. B: Ok, you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh, what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country, A: Uh huh. B: and I used to know as a Boy Scout B: but all I remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country, and to maintain it. A: Yeah. B: And, to me that's uh uh black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country. A: I agree there too. A: I agree with you there too. A: I I the um I I it's I find it you know personally disgusting A: But I don't think that I don't think that uh we have a right to stop somebody from that you know B: Uh-huh. A: the same I don't know A: I guess I get I get uh all mixed up inside. when, Yeah B: It's It's very easy to do. A: it when it's uh it's an emotional issue, A: and you sit A: and you try and think about it logically A: and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing, A: uh but logically um A: even you know for instance, the pro life pro choice movement, uh you know A: I don't know anybody that actually supports abortion, A: but they would vote pro choice. B: Uh B: Uh-huh. A: because you know That's just a disgusting thing you know A: somebody A: an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing, you know B: Well I think it should be permitted under certain A: but A: Yeah. A: but it that's uh that's what I mean, A: see, A: but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing, A: and it evokes an emotional response. A: I think that's the hardest thing, A: I don't know if I could ever be a judge, because some things emotionally just aren't you know B: Uh-huh. B: Huh. B: Well tell me B: has it ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human? A: No, A: no A: I think the um A: sometimes I guess A: what did I read recently A: the um the uh Christian uh point is is always the point of well it's at conception A: but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term. A: And there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology. B: Huh. A: so then that so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then. A: So it's A: I don't know. A: It's very it's it's uh you know It's a it's a topsy-turvy world A: and it's really something how um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um within a, B: Or they B: on their within the own uh society, it can vary. A: Yeah A: and how Yeah A: how it'll sway from one one extreme to another. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh I think that uh you know I I just read something I think in TIME magazine uh about um protest A: Okay. A: Um, I think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service A: because it, it seems like A: and I'm, I'm thinking of the of community of people that are in jail now, A: I think that maybe if, if, if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community, gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done A: because they, they understand people more, A: they understand helping people more, A: they understand the plight of people. B: That's true. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: I agree with you in the sense that, uh, I think that it's important for people to, uh, also share, give something of themselves A: Right. B: and, uh, I think that there's too much in the, in, in a way of self-gratification today, A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: and there's not enough sharing. A: Uh-huh. A: I would think that for, like people that are just filthy, filthy rich, B: Uh-huh. A: I think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they can see A: and I'm, I'm speaking about people that are like born rich, B: Yeah. A: and that's all they know, B: Yeah. A: and I'm thinking that community service would help them, uh, just get a feel of what else is out there, how other people are living, you know, A: if they were to work in, in a, a, I don't know, a soup kitchen or something, they would understand how other people live B: Yeah. A: and, uh, you know, on the same note if poor, if poorer people, uh, are working to, to serve the community, I don't know, they probably have a better perspective of, of life itself. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah B: and I think the Peace Corps is great too, because, uh, it, you go to different countries A: Uh-huh. B: and you see, B: uh, in fact I saw an interview on T V the other night with, uh, Patrick Swayze, A: Uh-huh. B: and he's making a movie in, I think it's, uh, Calcutta or either India, somewhere where it's, it's a very poor, poor country, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and he said that people in the west, B: he said since being there and I guess he's been there about six months, A: Uh-huh. B: he said that his whole idea of what's important has changed, A: Um. B: and he said that people have no idea, he said, of, of what human sacrifice is, you know, B: since being there he's, he's learned to, what it is to be poor and have nothing B: and yet those people have, uh, such, uh, a happy, uh, A: Uh-huh. A: demeanor, A: yeah, A: uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: in, in other words they don't dwell on, on what they don't have. A: Right. B: they dwell on what they do have B: and they're happy with each other type of thing. A: That's great. B: He said that out here, he said that when he comes back he knows that it, it's completely changed his life. A: Uh-huh A: and I, I think that that, you know, A: this, on the same note being A: he was exposed to that A: and maybe he wasn't before, B: Right. A: and now he sees, B: Exactly. A: and I think that anybody that works in the, in some kind of service or for the community or something, they can see, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: You don't see what, you don't, you can't know what you don't see, you know, B: Exactly right. A: so and you have to experience some things. A: You know a lot of people know that people, that other people are poor A: but you, they don't know what poor is, unless they actually see it and, you know, help or something. B: Yeah. B: Right. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: Well I, I know that it, that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of, uh, you know, helping them learn how to survive, how to plant, how to find water A: Uh-huh. B: and I've seen so many, uh, extraordinary things on T V, that people have done working in the Peace Corps and how, you know, uh, the people of the community they worked in is so much better, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: it's like one person can make a difference, A: Right. B: and I, I really believe that they can in something like that. A: There's something I, I've really be skeptical of, you know, A: you watch television A: you'll see the service announcement for children in other countries A: and, if you want to send like, you know, fifty cents a day, or something like that B: Uh-huh. B: Yes. A: and you can help a child. B: Uh-huh. A: It's, I don't know, I guess it's just me A: but I don't know whether to trust that or not, A: I mean there are so many scams, and things going on, you know, B: I know B: and how do A: I would love to help somebody, you know, B: Yeah. A: but I just, I can't bring myself to trust this, this company who is trying to do this or whatever it is, you know, B: Right. B: Uh-huh. A: just because people or so, I don't know, just today people are just so money hungry, that I think they would do anything, B: I know. B: It's true, B: it really is. A: and so you don't know what they, B: It's the sad life I think today. A: Uh-huh. B: It's, uh, it's, it's not like it used to be even in, in the years of my growing up. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean I'm fifty-three years old, A: Uh-huh. B: and I have seen a town change from a town to a city and its, uh, people, you know, grow from a small town to a large town, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and you would think that more people would be better, you know share more, do more, you know, be more community oriented and all, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: but if they just get more, uh, unto themselves kind of, A: More self-centered, uh-huh. B: right B: and, and it's not the sharing of, uh, a neighbor to a neighbor A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and we would go out and not even lock our doors and not even worry about it. A: Uh-huh. A: But you can't do that today. B: But today, I mean, you know, it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that. A: Uh-huh. B: If you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know? A: Yeah. A: Even when, when I first moved to Dallas from New York, it seemed like Dallas was so open, you know, A: everybody left their, doors open, B: Uh-huh. A: you just run, in the store, B: Yeah. A: you leave your car running, you know, B: Yeah. A: and this was only, uh, A: well I guess it has been awhile, A: it's been almost ten years since I moved here. B: Yeah. A: And it's amazing now how much it's changed. A: I mean I don't go out I don't go, outside at night, you know. B: In Dallas I, B: I was going to say B: cause I, I heard I, in fact I was talking to someone from Dallas, uh, just last week B: and they was saying that, uh, B: in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for T I, A: Uh-huh. B: and she had gone overseas to Tokyo, A: Uh-huh. B: and she asked them there if there was some, anywhere that she shouldn't go because she was alone, you know being a girl from another country, and everything A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and she said they thought for a few seconds B: and they said, uh, no, B: there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid. A: Uh-huh. B: They said to her that even if she left her purse on the subway okay, that she would have that purse returned to her, this is how confident they were, okay, with nothing missing A: Uh-huh. A: Wow. A: Wow. B: okay, B: this is a foreign country A: Uh-huh. B: and you would think, you know, uh, being, uh, an American or whatever, you know, a foreigner there that, that would be all the more reason that they'd take advantage of you. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh God, A: that would be the exact opposite of here. B: Okay. A: I mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it. B: And she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in, in and around Dallas, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and that's where she was from. A: Uh-huh. A: That is sad. B: She said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone, A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: That's, a big, that's a big thing with me. B: You know she had, B: there are certain. A: I live in a one bedroom, A: I'm single, B: Uh-huh. A: and I've, I could live in an apartment, A: I live in Waco, okay, B: Oh yeah. A: and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments. B: Yeah. A: And I live, A: I don't make a lot of money A: but I live in the high price apartments simply because I feel safe here B: Yeah. A: and I pay, I'm paying probably the hundred or hundred fifty dollars more than I would be paying somewhere else A: but I wouldn't be able to sleep at night B: Yeah. A: and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be, you know, B: Yeah. A: I feel very safe where I am, you know, A: instead of, B: And that, that's why I think if people were more exposed to, uh, A: Uh-huh. B: especially, uh, young kids getting out of high school. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean at one time they would go into the service, to have the same exposure and, you know, uh, to further their worldliness, so to speak. And go to see, uh, foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see, A: Uh-huh. A: Right. A: Uh-huh. B: it was like they said, B: join the Navy to see the world type of thing, you know, A: Right, A: right. B: but nowadays, they don't do that anymore. A: Huh-uh. B: It's not a, a thing a, B: a lot of young men don't even, uh, have the desire to go into the service. Or to, uh, you know, do something for someone else. A: Yeah, A: they don't even consider it. A: Uh-huh. B: And I don't know B: I attributed I think, a lot of that to women working. You know, to mothers not being at home. A: To, A: Yes! A: Yes! A: I was talking to someone yesterday about that. B: the bonding process, B: yeah. A: And we were saying that the basic, uh, the, the basic family is, is disrupted these days, B: It very definitely is. A: And so, I think, you know, before the father would work A: and the mother, you know, would stay home A: and having that mother there, that base, I think, was a big part of, of family, a big part of, of what, you know, your, your, uh, youngsters thought about, what they did, you know. B: That's right. B: Yeah. B: And the thing is, B: like I think a man can afford to support a woman, B: but the woman affords the luxuries. A: Uh-huh. B: In, in other words like anyone can live, on a certain income no matter what it is, A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: you have to, so to speak. Okay? A: Right. B: It, it's what's important to you. A: Uh-huh. B: Now a family, B: I, I think that like girls today, have children, A: Uh-huh. B: and six weeks later they're back to work. A: Right. B: They don't even have a bonding with that child, B: they, don't ever see the, A: Uh-huh. B: it's, it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child. The first, like say, six, years of life. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: So much, happens in that period of time, A: When I call, A: Uh-huh. B: and I mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three, big deal, A: Uh-huh. B: I mean they, they're in school, B: you're at work. A: Right. B: That's great. B: But it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and ... A: Right. B: Where you on the phone a long time? A: Yeah, A: I've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television B: Yeah. A: You were, he was waiting for what again? B: To, B: he called in to get somebody on the line, B: it took him about half an hour to find somebody. A: That's what this was A: yeah, A: well, let me go a head and push one A: okay? B: Okay. A: Okay. A: Well, basically I like comedy shows Uh, MURPHY BROWN, uh, DESIGNING WOMEN . B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: Yeah A: what do you like? B: Well we don't have a T V, B: I mean we have two T V B: but neither one of them work, A: Oh, okay. B: so for the last year, B: I mean we just got married B: and we decided well, for the first year we, we won't get a T V B: so I mean I'm totally out of it as far, as T V goes. A: That's okay A: we'll been married eleven years A: and, um, we went through that after about five years of marriage, A: my old T V that I had from college when we got married finally went out A: and we went, we made it almost about eighteen months without a television. B: Really? A: Yeah, A: but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize, um, gee I needed that, you know, B: Yeah. A: and then you get to remote control the stereo phonic, whatever all of those things, B: V C R, and everything else. A: oh, yeah, A: and then you never use the V C R, A: and now we have two of them A: and now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn't use it B: Really. A: Yeah, A: I mean it's cause your never home, you know, A: you're working, A: you're at school. B: Yeah. A: Well, I don't know T V shows, A: what can I tell you, um, A: basically junk that's on television B: Yeah. A: That's my opinion A: yeah, A: um, I like things like I just mentioned, A: have you ever seen MURPHY BROWN, or anything like that? B: I don't think so A: You don't think so, A: oh, that's the one with Candice Bergen in it, um, B: Well, see another thing was I worked on second shift for like a year and a half, B: so. I would never see any shows any way A: Yeah, A: that would do it. B: and then before that I was in college for four years B: and I never watched T V then because I didn't have time. A: Right, A: nobody does yeah, then, A: uh-huh. A: I know. B: I mean I did watch T V B: it was soaps and M T V cause the girls I lived with never changed the channels . A: And the, uh, A: well I don't, A: you're probably at least ten years younger then I am A: but I could tell you in school that, uh, the only thing that ever saw in the dorm was, uh, the one soap opera, ALL MY CHILDREN. B: Yeah. A: And until then I never paid attention to soap operas. B: Me too. A: And to this day twenty years later I'm like, I'm in my thirties, A: I'm not that old, A: but I'm going, jeez, I can't believe that thing's still on television B: I know, B: I mean I I almost got hooked on it cause everybody would took about it at dinner and everything else B: it, you know, it was like. A: Yeah, A: they, you know, A: about the only other kinds of things I like, um, A: I like to watch a lot of news, um, A: don't you miss that with not having a television so far? B: Um. A: How long has it been since you've had one? B: Well, about, almost a year. A: Oh my God B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: you've got about another six months A: and then you'll get one B: Well, I mean I never really watched it much growing up A: By then, B: but I thought, you know, my husband would really like miss it because he, he was an only child B: and he he's seen a lot of T V. A: Uh-huh. B: And I figured oh, no B: it will never last B: but. I mean I don't miss it that much. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: my husband is an only child too A: and he did miss it A: that's kind of why we got back after eighteen months, B: That's funny. A: and I'm trying to think about the only other show I watch. B: I've seen CHEERS probably five times B: and I've seen COSBY SHOW probably ten times. A: Yeah, A: I like COSBY, A: L A LAW is probably, A: I've seen CHEERS A: more then that I hate to admit A: but, uh, B: It's pretty cool B: I like that whenever I watch it. A: CHEERS? A: Yeah, A: I thought it was good, A: I've actually been to that bar in Boston A: it's a nice, you know, it's a pretty funny show. B: Oh, you have? A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I've heard it's pretty cool. A: It's just a, you know, over priced downtown, Boston yuppie, you know, tourist attraction. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: I'm trying to think what else is on television, A: I know it's like. B: I watched a lot of T V when the war was on. A: Yeah, A: who didn't? A: Isn't that sad? B: And then, uh, I like watching a lot of like college basketball and, and pro football, A: Uh-huh. B: I mean that sounds kind of stupid B: but, I do like it. A: Oh not, no, I like the pro, actually I like pro basket ball as opposed to, A: I watch pro football A: but I like the N B A play-offs, back when like the Pistons were in them B: Yeah. A: and now, A: where are you calling from? B: Uh, Sherman, Texas. A: Sherman, Texas, oh, B: Where are you from? A: I'm in Dallas A: I was just saying where am I calling you from, you know, A: well then I don't know if you like the, the Mavericks or not, A: they haven't been that good this year. A: Um, we're supposed to talk about television A: let's see A: you don't have a T V. B: So, are you really from Texas though? A: Yeah, A: I'm talking to you from Dallas, A: uh-huh. B: Well, sounds like you're from up north. A: My voice you mean? B: Yeah. A: Oh, no, A: that's just because I've moved around A: and, uh, I'm originally from Pennsylvania, B: Oh. A: so. B: I was going to say. B: Cause I wondered if you really, you know, if had any teams you like watching from up north or something. A: Uh, actually I'm a big Chicago Bears' fan. B: Yeah. A: Real big A: and, uh, um, I always watch them no matter who's on, A: of course you like them too, right. B: Yeah. A: Do you? B: Well, I'm from Indiana. A: Oh, okay. B: Yeah, B: so I like the Bears. A: Yeah, A: there you go, A: and then and, um, I'm trying to think what else I like to watch on television sports wise. A: I like, I like tennis B: I watch, uh, huh. A: so I mean I'm not, I haven't played in years A: but, um, I just like to watch, you know, two players really get, go at it, B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: It gets boring after a while A: but I don't, A: go ahead. B: I used to watch OPRAH a lot in the afternoons, before I went to work and stuff A: OPRAH B: and I see her every once in awhile like if I go workout at T I, A: Uh-huh. B: you know, they have those T V right, in front of the treadmills, A: Yeah, A: on the, on the tracks A: yeah, A: is B: I don't know B: she's not as good as she use to be B: but, A: Maybe cause she got chubby again or something, B: her disposition's gone downhill. A: Was she, was her show big when you where in school since you haven't been out that long? B: Was what? A: Was her show big when you where in college, since you, haven't been that long? B: Oh, yeah. B: It's pretty cool, A: Was it? B: I mean back then B: and the show, did you see the show where she lost all of that fat? A: Yeah A: I saw reruns of it, B: She she wheeled it out on a cart . A: I saw tapes of her A: yeah. B: That was so cool, B: and then man she's really porked out again I guess B: but, A: Gee, I know A: isn't that terrible. B: Yeah. A: I know A: I guess with that money who cares A: I don't know. B: I'd eat too. A: Let's see what else is on television. A: Oh, if you don't have a V C R we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it. B: Really. A: Yeah, A: cause, you know, if you like movies like we do you do it once in awhile A: and then, you know, you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it A: and then it usually comes on television within two years. You know. B: Yeah, B: we got, we've got the dollar Cinema in Sherman B: so we usually see like first-rate movies, right away. A: Yeah, A: really, that's television A: I don't know A: in general on this project we're suppose to talk about A: so I mean, B: Yeah B: I'm sorry. A: That's okay, A: don't, A: I mean, I, I always . B: Well, it's hard to talk about something, B: it's like me talking about taxes or something, A: Yeah. B: I feel bad cause I mean, I should know something about T V shows. A: Oh, that's okay. A: I had one lady one time A: they called in A: I just signed up A: my husband had been on this project, um, A: and I, I, she called in A: and it was all about, we don't have children and it was all about, um, sending your kids to college, and why you would advise them. A: And she was from Boston, A: and she, I shouldn't talk about this but she was, pretend she was a television show, A: and she was very snooty A: and, uh, her kids were going to places like Amherst and B U A: and I said I didn't know what that was A: I she went, oh, A: and I thought, um, A: so I know, A: I mean it's like don't worry about it A: television at least, you know, everybody's, at least seen television. During the war did you laugh when they had that man on, A: uh, what was his name Wolf Blitzer? B: What was that? A: That guy that was a reporter for C N N. B: Uh-huh. A: His name is Wolf Blitzer. A: Did you see it, him when he was doing the coverage of the Gulf? B: Um, I might of. B: I forget. B: Was he the guy that got captured? A: Uh, no, A: that was the other guy from C B S, A: oh, what was his name, uh, B: Oh. A: I can't remember his name. B: Yeah, B: but what about this Wolf guy? A: Yeah, A: but just , A: they made jokes about him like on the CARSON SHOW and all of that, B: Oh. A: Jay Leno. B: You know, what my absolutely favorite show is? A: Uh-huh. B: DAVID LETTERMAN. B: I love that guy. A: Yeah, A: he's funny. B: And SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, B: I use to watch that B: like I'd come home from second shift and watch him like for an hour and a half, B: he's great. A: Yeah, A: SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE has changed a lot if you haven't seen it in about a year. B: Huh-uh. A: I mean I haven't seen it in a couple of months A: but, B: Has it gotten better? A: Uh, yeah, A: actually I think it has, A: I mean they finally like A: and some of those people A: they really have funny characters on there. B: Really. A: Yeah, A: they have one character on there A: they just call it Pat A: and they, you don't know if it's a man or a woman A: And they say well, they're trying to deduce what he or she is, B: Uh-huh. A: so to see if it's a female they say well do you carry a purse A: and Pat says no A: I carry a fanny pack A: So you still don't know because a fanny pack is man, A: or now days, you know. B: Yeah. A: Yeah A: it's weird B: That's funny. A: Yeah, A: it's, yeah it is pretty funny A: I mean they do some crazy things. B: Like when WAYNE'S WORLD, B: I love that. A: Yeah, A: WAYNE'S WORLD, hey man A: And what's that other one where they, where they do the, um, skits, A: well, you've must have seen it recently? B: Well, I don't know, B: I've seen it off and on, I think. A: You probably have some friends that have television B: Uh? A: I said you probably have some friends that have television B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: That's where I've seen it B: because I've seen it off and on probably. A: You know, I mean you're not totally out of the loop. B: Yeah. A: I mean, yeah. B: We, we bug our we, you know, B: one friend of ours got rid of his because we motivated him because we, you know, cause we were getting along out ours B: so he sold his. B: But the rest of our friends we go and watch them. A: Yeah, A: I mean you really, you can do without one A: but after awhile it will start, um, you know, A: I mean you just kind of all of sudden A: cause you're going well jeez A: you hear about something that somebody else talked about, B: Uh-huh. A: and you just end up doing it A: but if you haven't been married that long, you know, you're doing other things B: Is that on tape? A: Is that on tape, A: there you go, A: yeah. B: That's funny. A: Oh, my A: what else is on A: I don't know A: what did they watch in college when you where in, A: where did you go to school? B: Oh, Purdue. A: Oh, that's a good school. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I know about that. A: They don't have a southern accent up there though. B: No. A: You must be native Texan? B: Why B: do I, Do I have a southern accent? A: Well your from Indiana, yeah. *your should be you're A: Oh, real southern, A: yeah. B: Are you serious? A: Uh-huh. B: I've been here three years. A: Deep one, you have a deep one, A: yeah B: Oh, wow, B: that's scary. A: It is, um, A: at Purdue A: I'm trying to think, I went to high school in Chicago, I'm trying to think what Purdue kids watch. B: We watch, uh, M T V twenty four hours a day B: and then every now and then they'd DAYS, they taped DAYS, you know, and watch it like four or five times a day. A: Uh-huh. A: Okay. B: That's the girls I lived with B: and, you know, other then that I'm sure they watched, A: Do you know that I've never, I think other then accept on a commercial or on news coverage or something, like entertainment tonight I've never seen M T V? B: Yeah. B: You aren't missing anything A: That's kind of what I've heard B: It's pretty bad. A: I mean that's, A: yeah. B: Especially if you have kids. B: Don't let them watch it. A: Yeah. A: No A: we don't A: and I wouldn't even I mean I don't even have cable A: I don't think it's worth ten to thirty bucks a month to pay, somebody, uh, to, you know, give me a hundred and fifty, um channel access to something I'm never going to, B: No. A: I mean my neighbor her husband sits in front of the television all of time A: and they've only been married five years have a cute one year old kids A: I swear to God he works from eight, A: Okay. A: Well, I heard Dallas is pretty bad with the crime. B: Well, you know, you know last night I was listening to the, uh, ten o'clock news. A: Uh-huh. B: And for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings, the number of drug deals that were going on, and crime B: and, and it's so depressing just to even listen to the news anymore. A: Uh-huh A: The same way here in Dennison. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean, uh, back a couple weeks ago they found, uh, some people I don't remember at some fast food restaurant. A: They had been, I can't remember if they had been shot or if they had just been thrown in the freezer A: but I'm pretty sure they'd been shot and put the freezer at the fast, food restaurant. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And I've worked, worked in fast food restaurants. A: They don't have that much money on hand, B: Yeah. A: they really don't. B: Yeah. B: I did too. B: I remember I used to work at, uh, Kentucky Fried Chicken. A: Uh-huh. B: And, and I just couldn't believe, um, you know, that B: now I would hate to work at a fast food restaurant or even have my children work in one. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, because of, uh, the crime B: that they would, um, kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there, uh, in their cash drawer. A: Yeah. A: Right. A: My husband worked at a gas station when he was a teenager. B: Uh-huh. A: And he, well I don't know, he decided not to work one night or something A: and one of the guys that was working was shot, B: Uh-huh. A: and, Kenny quit the next day. B: Uh-huh. A: He just, he couldn't deal with it. B: Yeah. B: yeah. B: Oh, I understand what your talking about. B: So, yeah, B: I have, uh, uh, you know, a real problem, uh, B: even though I live further out in the suburbs, the crime follows you anywhere, A: Uh-huh. A: Everywhere. B: it, it doesn't matter if you live in a small town or if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, so, but, I just think about the all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from, A: It just seems like a lot of people are attracted to the bigger cities though, B: Uh-huh. A: the worst part of it. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, I lived in Louisville, Kentucky for a while, B: Uh-huh. A: but, I lived on the outskirts too, A: but Louisville was pretty bad especially during like the, uh, Kentucky Derby. B: Yeah. A: At this time of the year it's horrible to live in Louisville. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh. B: Yeah. B: So, I don't know, um, you know, B: it's asking about what kind of steps we can take, um, uh, you know, just as citizens to try and, um, uh, protect ourselves. B: I know I have, uh, um, home security system. A: Uh-huh. B: Plus, I have the, uh, the special lights on, on the outside. B: And I have, A: The ones that blink off and on. B: Yeah, B: that, uh, A: By themselves I mean. B: yeah, B: yeah. B: By themselves B: if you if there's some kind of movement, then they'll automatically come on. Um, A: Right. B: but, I mean it's just I'm constantly think about keeping us safe and protected, verses, um, A: Uh-huh. A: How many kids do you have? B: Two. B: Two. A: Oh A: a boy or? B: One of each. A: Oh, that's what I've got, B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: It is scary, A: are your are they babies or, B: No, B: no, B: there teenagers now. A: Oh, well good. That they're a comfort to you. A: I've still got babies. A: Okay B: Yeah A: I've got a, a four year old. He'll be four. And a three month old. B: Oh, wow. A: And it's scary sometimes. B: Yeah. B: That's a problem. B: Yeah. A: I'm used to living in, uh, A: which A: we don't live in the city, B: Uh-huh. A: but we just. A: It's still more crowded than what I'm used to, B: Uh-huh. A: I'm used to having, you know, eight or ten houses on one street A: and this one's got houses on either side and, you know, real close together, B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: and just, B: Yeah. B: It's different, B: yeah, B: living down here. B: Now, now the nice thing, uh, B: I feel a little bit more comfort since we're so close together like this. Um, B: I, I feel like that there's going to be, uh, less crime B: or your neighbors going to be watching out for you, um, because it's, it's practically, it's in their backyard, too, A: Right. A: Oh, oh well, A: we think our neighbors are stealing from us, actually my husband. A: They, uh, well, the one of them's a teenager that lives next door A: and her friends are pretty wild. A: They've stolen gas out of our vehicles. B: Oh goodness. A: And so he went and got a locking gas cap for his. B: Uh-huh. A: They weren't stealing it out of mine so much, because my car, the gas thing is kind of weird where it's hard to, syphon gas out. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: So he, he went and got a locking cap A: and they tried to break that off. B: Oh my goodness. A: And you excuse me. He went down to Uba , and noticed that it was hanging off where, where they had tried to break it off. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And they stole our tailgate off his truck B: Oh goodness. A: Well, we can't say they did A: but, B: Someone did, A: We're pretty, A: yeah, B: Yeah. A: it had to be somebody that, you know, could do it in the middle of the night A: and, you know, they'd seen it earlier. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah B: I know that it's a real problem. B: It doesn't matter where you are anymore. A: Uh-huh. B: It's, uh, more of a matter of what you, the steps that you do trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines. And that they'll run a topic into the ground. A: Yeah. B: And, uh. You know, they try to play public's opinion. Which I think is awful, because it usually works. A: Uh-huh, A: true. A: I'll bet that was the case of the, the war in the Middle East. B: Yes, B: uh-huh. B: That, B: uh, lots of new, uh, newsmen were created during that B: so, it will be interesting to see what happens. A: Uh-huh, A: true. A: Trying to think what else is, is current. B: Right. B: Uh, uh, A: Well, um, I don't know what to say A: Uh, that's a bad one, A: they, uh, A: looks like we're going to have an income tax in Texas, B: Yeah, B: I hate to see that, B: but it's, uh, that, you know, if what it's going to take, B: well, you know, we can deduct that from our income tax, our federal income tax. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, you know, but we need good schools. B: Uh, we're more involved in that now. B: And, I, I, I, I think it's better for everybody if we had better schools. A: Yeah, A: that's true. B: So, A: I would think they could find a better way to fund it though, A: but they haven't for, B: No. B: You know, I wish they could have gotten a lottery. A: Well, they're struggling with it. B: Yeah. B: I think, you know, the lottery could have helped, with that. B: I mean, it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax. B: I mean, probably would have paid the same amount B: but, you know, it's not the idea of your paying, uh, income tax. A: Uh-huh. A: True. B: So, A: I, I'm not sure there's a positive solution for that. B: No. B: It'll be interesting to see what happens. A: Trying to think what else is current. B: I, you know, I haven't seen the news in a couple of days. B: So it, uh, B: I'm a little behind on things. A: Well, the other thing I can think of is, uh, what is still going on in Iraq and the Kurd refugees. B: Yes, B: that's, that's sad. B: Yeah. B: They, uh, yeah, they had to choose between the better of the two, two bad situations, B: and, uh, I don't know what I've would have done in the situation. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and, finish the job while we were in there. B: Yeah. B: Right. B: But I understand why Bush, you know, doesn't want to go in and, and uh, take sides. B: I mean, because that would definitely look like another Korea, A: Uh-huh. B: and he'd have all these people jumping down his back, even though I'd agree with it. B: I think he ought to, should've gone in there and blew them away. A: Seems to have helped him though, popularity wise. B: Yeah, it, it, it did a lot. B: He did a real good job I believe. B: I have, uh, in-laws that live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too. A: Hm. B: It, uh, it, uh, you know, B: we, so we kept very much abreast of what was going on. A: Yeah. A: Were, were they in any of the areas where they, some of the Scuds? B: Yeah, B: they were on the, the, near, uh, Dahran. On the, on the east coast. A: Um. A: Um-hum. A: Yeah. B: They were just north of it. Probably about a hundred fifty miles, hundred miles from uh, the Kuwaiti border. A: Um. B: Uh, and they stayed active was the, uh, the military there. Taking supplies out to them in the desert. A: Uh-huh. B: It was, it was a new situation. A: Yeah. A: I'll bet. B: I don't really have much more to say A: I don't know anything else that's current other than the weather A: and, B: You're right, B: and that's, that's awful in Texas A: Have, have you all been getting rain storms down there? B: We got some awful rain, uh, the other morning. B: And today's just been real drizzly. A: We did, we did last night. Uh, some real massive thunderstorms. B: Yeah. A: Apparently, I, I don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too. B: Uh-huh. A: Caused some damage. B: It did? A: We may get some more tonight. B: Oh, well. We, we've just got slight chances of rain. B: But, uh, we had the, we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning. B: Course while everybody was getting ready to go to work. Making nice traffic jams. B: So A: Uh-huh. A: Well the, the ground here is so flat, A: and it's all saturated now, B: Oh A: we're getting some flooding. B: Right, B: uh, when was it, last week, we had all the rain? B: But, uh, B: we, I think we had about eight inches. A: Hm. B: It was between six and eight inches here where we are. A: Goodness. B: And, uh, it, you walk out on the ground, B: I mean you, B: I mean, it's awful. B: It's just so soggy. A: Yeah. A: It's a lot more humid down that way. B: Yeah A: In fact, miserable. B: Well, today it was, I mean, the air was just so sticky, so damp. A: Yeah, A: I think there were places around downtown Fort Worth last night they got three inches in a real short period of time, like an hour or so just, a bunch. B: Goodness. A: Well, I guess that's it B: Right. B: Well it's, A: That's about as much as we can do with current events. B: Right. B: Well, it was nice talking to you. A: Good talking to you, Michelle. B: All right. B: Bye-bye. A: Bye-bye. A: Okay. B: The public school systems, well everybody's has known they've needed renovation for years, but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it. A: Uh-huh. B: The first direction that I can see, or I wish, I would love to see them go with. B: Kids learn at different rates B: and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together. B: You'd learn at this rate B: and that's the only way it's going to happen. A: Yeah. A: That's true B: You've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it, B: and the the other fifty-seven minutes you've been talking about a subject, you've bored them. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: that's, that's very true. A: Um, I guess I can relate to that, because I have two kids that are opposites like that. A: Uh, one picks up real quick A: and the other one doesn't. A: And you're right, they do get bored, uh, really fast, if they already know what you're talking about. A: What do you propose that they do? A: What, what is your suggestions? B: The educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with, uh, the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person. A: Uh-huh. A: Out of each child. B: Out of each child. A: Each individual child. B: Some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff. B: Other kids are going to be really into math, B: some are really going to be heavy into reading. A: Right. B: Instead of pushing the scales too far either direction, I mean it's great to be well rounded and be exposed to all this stuff. A: Yeah. A: That's, B: But why not hit the points the kid's really interested in? B: Because if he's interested, he's going to study it, B: and he's going to learn it, B: and he's going to remember it. A: That's true. A: The only, I think the only thing that they would argue about that, is that, you know, every child needs to learn every subject. A: I mean, that's, that might be the only thing. A: But, I mean, I, I definitely agree with you. Uh, B: They need exposure to every subject. B: They don't need to be masters of it, A: Right, A: right. A: That's true. Uh, B: Everything I learned about ancient Rome has not helped me anywhere in, my adult life. A: Yes, A: I definitely agree. A: There's no doubt about that. A: I, uh, I, I mean, I can relate to that because I'm, I'm going to college right now, A: and I feel like, I mean, I'm taking this history class. A: And, I mean, it's so boring, A: and I just hate it. A: And I think, why do they make us take this stuff? A: I mean, what does this have to do with getting, you know, a computer science degree or whatever, you know? B: What, what type of history class is it that you're having to take? A: Uh, American History. A: We have to take, um, like this is like early seventeen hundreds through, I don't know, I think like mid eighteen hundreds. A: And then we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up, to basically present. B: Well, the early ones they could actually combine two, two, levels of it, the one from seventeen hundred til say, the end of the Civil War. A: Yeah. B: Combine that into one. And then from eighteen sixty-five to present, B: and make that your second step because, To a point, to a point the bottom, you know, the early parts of it, you're giving the foundations of the nation A: Yeah. A: That's, well that's, basically what they're doing. B: and, but even then they're skimming over, B: they're very, almost trivial with it. A: Yeah, A: oh, yes. A: Definitely, A: I agree. A: Yeah, A: there's, B: You know, I mean, if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter, I mean, there's, they make all these people out to be, oh, B: they were great men, B: and they're the father of the country and all this. B: He had just as much dirt on him as anybody else. B: If not more. B: The man was not a saint. A: Yeah. A: That's true, A: yeah. A: Any way, this, this, um, school system thing, A: I, I tell you, I saw something on the news, oh, I don't know, maybe two weeks ago. A: And they were talking about, A: I don't know where you're from, A: but I'm from the Dallas area. A: And they were talking about the Plano school system, that, they had one school that, uh, if the students did something wrong, I mean, whether it was behavioral or, uh, you know, they weren't learning properly or something. They took these students and put them basically in a closet. With no windows. A: They had, a, a table, or not a table, but a desk in this closet, A: and they had to sit in there by themselves. A: Well, parents were getting really angry about this, because they said, Why is my child being put in this closet. A: Well, how is that helping my child, you know. A: And, uh, the, the thing, you know, A: they said, Well, we're giving them isolation time A: and this helps them to think. A: But a lot of kids, A: I mean, if a child has, uh, claustrophobia, I mean, that's just going to terrify him, you know A: and, B: If, if the isolation concept really works that good, why are our prisons overcrowded? A: Uh, that's true. A: That's true. A: But, no, A: I mean, they were, uh, I mean, A: I definitely agree with parents. A: I think that is a very wrong way to handle, uh, disciplining a child. A: Putting them in, I mean, they were, they were they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms. A: They didn't call them closets. A: But they showed these rooms on, uh, you know, on the news A: and, I mean, they looked like a closet to me. You know, with a desk in it, a real small. A: But they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms. A: I said, now what good does I mean, how is this helping? A: I mean, either way. You know, I, I definitely had to disagree with that. A: I think that is, that's not the way to handle a child, you know, discipline a child by putting him in a closet B: the as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that the public school system I want to see changed too. B: When I was brought up, if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough, you were going to get spanked. A: Right. B: Well, then the extreme came in, B: and now we can no longer, spank them, A: Right. B: so we now isolate them. A: Yep. A: Uh B: Okay, B: we've swung the pendulum both ways. B: Let's find a middle ground. B: Instead of, there has to be some sort of discipline, B: and there has to be some sort of punishment. Short of physically isolating the child, and short of physically hitting the child. A: Right. A: Well, B: Let's put him into a situation where, okay, you crossed the line, you broke the rule, you're going to have to pay for it. A: Right. B: But, it's going to tax you physically. A: Uh-huh. A: I, I don't, B: Have I mean, instead have them pick up around the school yard, have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school Do something to beautify the school property. A: Yeah, A: that's true. B: But you cut, you know, B: the, the kid's having to give up his, quote, play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong. A: Well, B: But he's seeing something constructive come out of it. A: um, I have to, A: I think one of the positive things, I mean, one of the things that can come out of, uh, is not just discipline, okay? A: But, okay, A: for instance, one of the things they do at, uh, my kids school, uh, they have what they call, uh, caught being good slips. A: And when the kids are in halls and stuff, and if they're being really good, I mean, just being excellent, they're not, you know, cutting up and so on. A: They're just standing in line, doing whatever they are supposed to, A: they get one of these caught being good slips. A: And then, when they collect them at the end of each week, they get to go to this little, what they call their caught being good store, A: and then they get to spend these like money. A: Well, see, to me, that's positive reinforcement, is much better, much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids, because they're going to be good and try and earn those things, you know, to get the positive part of it. A: I mean, they'd much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked. A: So, they're definitely going to work towards being good, you know, rather than trying to act up and be bad, you know. B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. B: We've been too long, there's been too much negative reinforcement. B: How much, like, the caught being good slips. B: How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, A: well that's true. I think, I think, really though, A: I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need they need to be spanked. A: But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. A: And it really helps. A: And I mean, they, they don't get spanked very often, A: but they, they do when they deserve it, you know. A: But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. A: I mean, I, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child. A: But, you know, that's just my personal opinion, A: and that's not going to, A: I mean, I don't think that law will ever change. A: They are never going to let a, a teacher spank a child again. A: But I don't think, A: I mean, some kids don't get don't get spanked at home A: and some kids need to be spanked at home. A: I mean, don't you think? B: I, most wholeheartedly agree. A: But I don't know. B: I mean, there's a point of over kill, B: but somewhere in, you've got to find an even line. A: Right, A: right. A: Well, there's so many parents that say, you can deal with a child without spanking them. Which is true, you can. A: But there are times when a child needs to be spanked. A: I mean, they do things that they need that. B: Need that shock effect, where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked. A: Right. ends with no further A: Okay. A: Um, I guess what, I guess my task. A: I usually ride my bike. A: I have, uh, a stationary bike and, uh, a regular bike. A: And when I can, I like to ride my regular bike outside, because it's so much nicer. A: The stationary bike is, is so, uh, boring. B: Boring. A: But I have head phones, A: and I, plus I have it, uh, in the living room A: so I either watch T V, or we have a fish tank, A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. A: If, I like to have the T V on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. A: It kind of takes the time away A: and I don't realize, really, that's really the only time I ever watch T V, is when I'm on the bike. A: But, and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, A: and that just kind of gets myself, uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. A: But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it. A: I wish that I did enjoy it more, A: but I do it because I have to not because I want to B: I bought a stationary bike, B: but I find that if I sit on that seat too long, it hurts. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: And I haven't figured how to get that soft, B: and I tried even tying a pillow to it. B: But two years ago, I joined, well, it's not quite two years, it's almost two years, I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano. A: Uh-huh. B: And I love it. A: Really? B: I just love it. A: So is it just women that go there? B: Yeah. B: It's totally women. A: See, I think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place, uh, a, a health club. A: Because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise. A: You know, so I have tried to just do stuff at home A: and, uh, I just feel conscious about it. A: I mean, I'm not big, you know, or anything, A: but I still don't like other people watching me. B: I like to be able to sweat, have my hair a mess. Uh, feel that, okay fine, if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have to be conscious of it being a little bit too low. A: Yeah. A: Right. B: And I, my bathing suit's just one piece, B: so there's no big deal all the way around, B: but I don't have to be conscious of what I'm doing or how I'm doing it. A: Uh-huh. B: And it's, uh, oh, it's just, I don't know, it's, it's a total free relaxation. B: Because, hey, you can do what you want. B: You're a female, B: and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing. A: That's what, B: And they've got such fantastic equipment in there. A: Really? A: That's, that's great. B: Oh, yeah. A: How, B: And I love the water aerobics. B: Uh-huh. A: and so, I went to Hawaii and then to Australia and Japan and China, B: Uh-huh. B: Did you go on the Barrier B: did you see the Great Barrier Reef and, and go snorkeling? A: I, I, actually I didn't go diving. B: Uh-huh. A: I, I'm a diver A: and so, that's, that's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips B: Oh diving. B: Uh-huh. A: but, uh, A: no A: I didn't get to the Great Barrier Reef. A: I drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Adelaide. B: Uh-huh. A: It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. A: The coastline was just incredible. A: It's huge. B: Is it really? A: Australia. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: Uh, but, B: Did you have shrimp? B: I've seen in, you know, B: they, they show all this wonderful seafood and, and great big prawns, you know the big shrimp B: and, A: I don't remember if I had shrimp. B: No? B: Didn't have shrimp there huh A: I don't think so. B: I remember food A: Oh, I like that too. A: But, uh, in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car, A: it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it like in the van, with a bunch of people. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, B: Oh you're adventurous. B: You went by yourself. A: Uh-huh. B: Really. A: And I was by myself in China too. B: Really? A: Yeah. B: Oh wow. A: China was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge. A: But, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time, B: Uh-huh. A: and so I never, you know, got out by myself, or not much, B: Uh-huh. B: Was it very expensive? A: No, A: actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit, A: no A: maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less, A: I don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare A: and, but this is from Hong Kong, B: You're kidding! B: No kidding! B: Uh-huh. A: because I was already in Hong Kong A: and, um, but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there A: and I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu A: and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it. A: It's a little, uh, sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai. A: It's just a train ride. B: Uh-huh. A: And that, A: I had two internal, one, yeah, two internal plane flights and a couple of other things. A: It was really, B: All for a thousand dollars? A: Uh-huh. B: Wow! B: That really surprises me. A: Around a thousand. B: I guess I relate it to, to Japan where things are very expensive, aren't they? A: Oh, Japan's ridiculous. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: And I stayed, I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels A: but I stayed in, A: they were all completely clean, B: Uh-huh. A: and, you know, they were newly built A: and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels, because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: and you don't want to stay in the very, very, very exclusive, because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're, A: Right. A: Right. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Wow. A: Uh, but A: yeah, A: that was, A: I highly recommend that way to go. A: If you're ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman, A: her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston B: Oh really. A: Yeah. A: Uh, and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China A: and she just gave me this woman's name to contact A: and it would really be fun, I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide B: Uh-huh. A: and then, A: Well I grew up out in the country and, uh, was used to having, uh, guns around the place A: and, uh, I'm, uh, not for gun control, in the strictest sense of the, uh, word. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: I, I think I'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself. A: Yeah. B: You know, I have quite a collection myself B: and, you know, I'm a good hunter B: and I started hunting when I was twelve years old. B: Of course, my parents made me take hunters safety classes B: and, you know, I don't want to see them ban guns completely A: Yeah. B: but I don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either B: so, A: Yeah. A: Well I, I feel that its, uh, A: I think the what was National Rifle Association, uh, had this bumper sticker a few years back if, uh, about if you outlaw guns, A: only outlaws will have guns then. B: I believe that. A: And I believe that too because the person that is wanting to, commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gum, a a gun, a knife, a, a rock, a stick, whatever it is, to commit a crime with, B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns, uh, A: we can handle it A: but there's an element that can't. B: Yeah B: and it's, you know, it's got to the point now where even our, our police departments and our D E A agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons B: because everybody that's in drug trafficking has got them. A: They have got them outgunned. B: You know. Yeah. B: So. A: There was a an article in the paper just this week where I think it's, uh, one of the gun companies, I can't remember which, was developing a ten metal, ten millimeter automatic pistol for the F B I which would give them additional firepower. B: Um. A: It had, held like a fifteen shot clip, which, uh, would be able, they would be able to put down anything that came at them, B: Yeah B: Yeah, B: that would be, A: but you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun, uh, a thirty-eight, uh, B: Yeah, B: that's, A: Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good. B: No B: it's sure not. B: Huh-uh. A: Yeah. A: I have lived in, uh, Illinois at one time A: and they, they passed a, uh, it wasn't really gun control A: but it was, you had to register as a gun owner, A: you didn't have to list your guns, B: Yeah. A: but you had to have this card, A: it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition B: Um. A: and that was the first, uh, A: this was twenty years ago. B: Yeah. A: But they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect. B: See in California they, In California they make you register when you buy ammunition. A: Pardon? A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: You have to sign a, you know, B: they take your name and driver's license number, hunter, hunting license number and all that good stuff, before you can buy any big ammunition. Especially for handguns, A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: now rifles aren't too bad, B: but, you know, any kind of handgun at all, if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have to buy it, or sign up for it, A: Yeah. B: so. A: We lived in Tennessee for awhile A: and I bought a pistol there A: and there was a fifteen day waiting period. A: You had to fill out an application and, go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted B: Uh-huh. A: and, then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing. B: Gee. B: Gee, that's not a bad idea. A: No, A: I think that, uh, you know, a, a waiting period, uh, can make a difference B: Yeah. A: but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that. B: Yeah, B: yeah B: it is. A: So there's, I don't, think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because, B: No. B: the only way they could do it I think, would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun. A: Right, A: right. B: You know, I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit, course, B: I, I feel kind of weird about that anyway, B: I think if somebody shoots somebody, they ought to be shot. A: Yeah, A: I'm, B: So. A: We, we're getting into capital punishment now B: Yeah, B: but, you know. A: But I, I agree with you there that, uh, B: It would definitely be gun control A: Yeah. A: The, uh, the, again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: It's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose, legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: And I'm in favor of keeping the, the illegal guy from getting one in his hands A: but, the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element. B: Myself. B: Yeah. B: Well and they're actually a necessity in life, you know. A: Oh yes. B: They're not, you know, B: not everybody needs a gun B: but sooner or later I need one. B: You know, whether I'm out hunting or you know, B: I'm never had to protect my life or, A: Yeah. B: well I did in the service but not, you know, not on the street B: so I don't really need one in the, in the aspects , A: You don't have to carry one in your car or your, uh, or your pocket all the time. B: No, B: huh-uh. A: Yeah. B: No. B: So mine are, you know, I use mine for recreation, A: Yeah. B: I don't, B: and I enjoyed my guns. A: Yeah. B: I have a good time with them B: so, A: Well I know what, uh, A: I took my kids out and taught them out, how to shoot a gun. A: My wife the same thing, uh, she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that I have an arsenal or anything, B: Yeah. A: but we have several guns around the house A: one of these days my grandkids probably. B: Probably. B: Yeah. A: But I think it's, uh, A: you got to have, have the A: living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot A: but, uh, still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that when, it's not like on T V when someone gets shot, uh, they get back up. B: No, B: huh-uh. A: If someone gets shot with a, real gun they don't get back up. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: I had to explain that to my, B: I've got a six year old now B: and he, you know, B: I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old, well B: they understand now. A: Yeah. B: You know I've taken time to teach them B: and now the young boy wants to know B: and, you know, like I told him, you're a little bit young for a gun. Let me go out here and, you know, we would start with the B B gun deal, you know, A: Yeah. B: so he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows B: and I took it away from him, B: I said now, you know, so he's learning the hard way B: but at least it was a B B gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something B: so, A: I remember I had an old uncle up by Tulsa, Oklahoma that took me out and, uh, showed me. A: This was, it was not my, it was my mother's uncle, A: this was a gentleman in his sixties, B: Um. A: and he took me out with him and, uh, single shot twenty-two, and taught me how to shoot. B: Uh-huh. A: We went squirrel hunting A: and, and, uh, he taught me how to shoot, uh, a old single shot twenty-two B: All right. A: and, I was probably about twelve at the time, B: Uh-huh. A: and I thought that was the neatest thing A: and, of course Uncle Sam took me out, took me hunting with him B: Yeah. A: and he let me shoot and showed me how. B: All right. B: I think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one. A: Right. B: You know, I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away, B: so. A: Oh, yeah. A: Well that's about all I, A: we agreed pretty well on this I think. B: Yeah, B: I think so. A: Okay. A: Well it's been real nice talking with you. B: All right, B: have a good one. A: Okay, A: bye. B: Bye-bye B: Do you have children? A: Uh, yes, A: yes, A: I have a daughter. B: Do you. A: Yeah. B: How old is she? A: She's only about, uh, uh, a little less than two years old. B: Uh, I guess you have not reached the stage where you need to, uh, promote a college or anything, huh. A: No. B: I've got one that's seven and one that's three, B: so, we, uh, we started saving, B: but that's all. A: Yeah B: So, do you, is there, are you planning to, like, encourage your children to go to a particular school? A: Uh, no, uh, um, A: no particular school. A: Uh, I think that's really a decision that, B: That you are going to let them make. A: They, A: well, help them make in terms of, you know, what they are, they are wanting to do. B: Right. B: Uh-huh. A: You know, that, that's a big influence, I think and, You know what, not only what you can afford, but what, what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Right. B: Uh-huh. A: So, uh, you know, you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do. B: Yeah. B: Where did you go to school? A: Uh, University of Mississippi. B: Oh. B: Was that local or, uh, A: Uh, well, it was, well, it was within the state. B: Uh-huh. A: But it, it was not necessarily local, it was, B: Yeah. B: But I, I mean, so what's, , A: What's the criterion for choosing to go there? B: Yeah. A: Uh, well, at the time, I was, uh, thinking of going pre med B: Uh-huh. A: and in the state, uh, they had the best pre med uh, curriculum for the, uh, state institutions. B: Uh-huh. A: It was choice between there and, uh, a private college that, uh, was a bit more expensive. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: At the time, we really could not afford it A: so I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me. B: Yeah. A: It, A: uh, I enjoyed it. B: So you, did you commute everyday then B: or, A: No. B: Oh, okay. A: No, A: no, A: it was a six hour drive. B: Oh, okay, B: when you said it was quite a, quite a way away, I did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour B: or, A: I was, uh, it was like another world. B: Uh-huh. A: Basically, it was a, no it was a, A: did not get home that often, you know, A: and at that age it's, uh, it's kind of, kind of difficult sometimes. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: Especially, if you have not been away a lot that extended B: Yeah. B: So, did you go there, like, straight out of high school? A: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Uh, see I did not get my degree until later on, B: so I just finished mine a couple of years ago. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, you know, I guess, you know, when you have to do it that way, it makes, makes your choices a lot easier B: but, A: Uh, that's true. A: Yeah, A: that, that's like, you know, when I went on to get my, my master's I, uh, basically was, you know, it was where I was at the time. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: You know, I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled B: Right, B: right. A: and I was trying to work. A: But, uh, so when you are first going to school that, you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go. B: Exactly. B: Yeah. B: which group do you work in in T I? A: Um, uh, the computer science center. B: Oh, uh, where is that at? A: Uh, north building. B: I see. B: How long do you work for T I? A: Uh, about three years. B: Did you work somewhere else, B: like sounds like you got your master's before here B: or, A: Uh, yeah, A: I have, uh, uh, A: no A: actually, I mean I came straight from school to here. B: I see. A: So, cause this was the first, first real job after getting my degree. B: Uh-huh. B: After your master's or after your, A: After my master's. B: I see. A: My undergraduate degree was not in, not in what my master's was. B: I see. A: So I made a career change basically. B: Uh-huh. B: I see. B: Well, let's see B: I, have not you know, B: there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools, you know, just like you said. B: Uh, depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford, different things like that, B: so I, I have not really made up my mind, you know, whether to encourage them to go different places A: Yeah. B: or, A: One day I would like to, uh, you know, the, uh, A: I, I like the school where I went. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean, and I would not hesitate at all to, to encourage her to go there there if she wanted to. B: Right. B: Right. A: Or the school where I got my master's at, which, which was a different school. B: Right. A: And, uh, I liked it almost as well. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, but, uh, you know, that, I'm not going to hold them to that just because I went there. B: Right. A: I, you know, think that's B: Yeah. A: If they want to, that's fine, but otherwise not. Although I uh, would get quite a break on, on tuition B: Yeah. B: Um, because you went there. A: Yeah, A: because they, uh, allow for, uh, uh, tuition, uh, break for out of state students who children of alumnae. B: Um. B: I didn't know that. A: Well certain schools do it. B: Yeah. A: This school does. A: So, uh, It's, it , B: Huh. A: I, I was involved in some, uh, oh, alumnae recruiting, uh, here in town, uh, recently, uh, well last year B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, and it was kind of fun, because you are trying to to, trying to get people interested in your school, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: And they were, A: this was a college night at a, at a high school in Richardson. A: And it was, B: Uh-huh. A: And there were a bunch of kids, you know, and a bunch of schools. A: There were a hundred schools, probably there all competing for the same kids. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: It's kind of interesting to, to, to talk up, you know, your, school B: Yeah, B: your own school, A: And, I was surprised by the number of kids that came, came by and had heard of, you know, our school. And, and were interested in it. B: Uh-huh. B: Um. A: Uh, you know, we, uh, A: situations like that, you don't realize, you know, until you start thinking about it, the kinds of advantages you school may have over others. B: Uh-huh. A: And so, I, I was real, real pleased with that. A: That worked out so well. B: Yeah. B: So did you drum up any interest then A: I think so. A: I don't know offhand A: but, uh, it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there. B: Uh-huh. A: So, there, There was one mother who, uh, came by right, even, before we started, who, who obviously was, uh, very interested in getting her, her daughter in or, or having gotten her daughter in or something B: And that, A: and she was wanting some more information. A: But she was, her, her daughter was, uh, a, a, a majorette or something. You know, a baton twirler or something B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: and she was she was, letting us know she, how, how good her daughter was. A: She had cards printed up, actually describing, you know, business cards describing her daughter's, uh, you know, she had won several different twirling awards, and all this, B: Oh, really. B: Uh-huh. A: and she was, had these business cards she was passing out A: and it was quite a production. A: I think some parents go a little bit overboard. B: Yeah B: it sounds like it. A: Yes. B: Well you know I think Richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely B: Okay, B: well the topic is selecting care for the elderly. A: Uh-huh. B: And I don't have elderly parents, yet but not that far in the distant future. B: What about yourself? A: Well, my parents are both in their seventies. A: My, my mother and stepfather, and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies. A: And, my, uh, uh, father and stepmother are not in very good health. A: So this is something that is, B: A concern of yours right now. A: Yes, A: it is. B: Are, are they living independently, right now? A: Yes, A: they are. B: Oh. A: They are. B: Have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that? A: Not for them, my, my mother and stepfather have, have, uh, set up an arrangement where they have a large home and, uh, two of my sisters and, and their families, one of them's husband and then all the children are living in this home. A: Its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms A: and, and, uh, they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen. A: And, and, uh, my father bought this, uh, my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care A: and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home. B: Oh, that sounds the ultimate. A: Unless, unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home. B: Well, even at that point, most care can be given at, in the home. B: That sound like just an excellent solution. B: You must feel real good about that. A: Well, I, I felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also. A: I, uh, I read a lot A: and then I know people then have visited nursing homes and, uh, have had great, grandparents in the nursing homes A: and it was not a happy situation for, for any of them. A: And, and, uh, we have a very active nursing home here in Plano that, that has, uh, activities going all the time A: and they have, uh, A: even the people that are wheelchair bound and, and really are, are incapacitated. Go and, uh, participate in olympics B: Uh-huh. A: and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here B: Right. A: You know, so there are a lot of, a lot of activities going on all the time A: and this is a nursing home, A: it's not a senior citizens home. A: So that the people are really, uh, B: Really in need of a nursing home. A: Right. A: They need, the nursing care, B: Right, B: uh-huh. A: and, and, but it's a very expensive solution. B: Well, it's, you know, B: I think we just, you know, listen to, is the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes. B: It's just a matter of finding, a good home. A: Right. A: Right. B: And, and then, of course, there is always the problem of being able, able to afford either of those solutions. A: Right. A: Uh-huh. B: And that, I think is what is scary, B: and I also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from. Is when people have to put people in a nursing homes B: and they really can not afford the best. A: Right. A: And that's right, I, well I took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation A: and, uh, they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had, had, uh, apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating. B: Oh. A: And, uh, he had apparently had not been in the home too long, just a week or so, A: but when they, the family came in to see him, they had not been made aware, A: I was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance A: and I overheard their conversation. A: And when the family walked in, his wife and daughter and son-in-law, they were not even aware of what had happened. B: Oh, goodness. A: So, I told them he strangled on some chicken A: and, uh, they said, the, the woman, the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or, so, you know, B: Oh. A: and I thought B: What a shame, B: they put him in the home so that he could be cared for A: Right. A: Right. B: and then they could have done that well at home. A: And then she was upset, A: he had on two different shoes, one of which was not even his. A: He had on a pair, of slacks, B: Oh. A: and the wife said "these are not his slacks" A: and she said "I just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean." A: And, B: You hear these stories, all the time. A: Right. A: Right. A: Well, I, this was just something that I was, I witnessed to. B: You happened, B: Right. A: And, and, uh, at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in. A: And we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour B: Oh. A: And, with just a curtain, of course, between us and, and, uh, B: Right. A: they revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth, A: and he was definitely, A: just by looking at him and the way he acted, you could tell he was in need of, of nursing home care, A: but the family were all talking about, uh, putting him in another home. A: They said he will not go back to that one. B: Well, good. B: Good, B: I'm glad they have a solution. To do that, A: I'm glad they the option. B: yes. B: I know. A: I, I would hate to be in a position where that was all I could afford A: and there were not, there was no choice. B: Exactly. B: My, uh, my ex-husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for, oh, it must be seven, eight years, B: and, uh, and, uh, It's just her, her condition deteriorated, deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home. A: Oh, my. A: Um. B: As the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from, from people who have been independent all their lives. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: Like this was a really neat vital woman B: and you get in a nursing home B: and the first thing that happens you have to share your, your whole living space, with someone that you have never known before in your life. A: Right. A: Right. B: And oh I, I do not know what the answer is, B: but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there B: and it, I think it does, B: a lot of it goes down to just money. And family support, A: That's right. B: uh, if you, you know, have family that, uh, you can live with. A: Visits everyday. B: Right. A: Right. B: Right. B: I, I really, B: I think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care, you know. B: You would do your research B: and you would go visit. A: Visit, A: right. B: And, uh, hopefully, they would have, they would have it so that you could go there anytime. A: Right. B: Because if you could not go there anytime, then that would make you, a little bit A: Suspicious. B: right. A: You know, I, I, my, I remember my, my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died A: and I guess there was not a name for what she had at that time, A: but I guess Alzheimer's would come as close as anything, A: she really was not aware of what she was doing. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, I I can remember she had several strokes A: and the nursing home was right next to a hospital A: and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days. A: And it was, she was, it was just like keeping something. B: Well, we've talked a little bit about the Plano school system. B: Um, I, I really have been pleased with Plano. B: I have a child who, uh, B: my son is learning disabled, A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, I thank God every day that I have the resources that we have tapped into. A: Now, is he the elementary school? B: He's in elementary school. A: Uh-huh. B: And he's not severely learning disabled. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, you know, he just, He's being helped. A: But he is being helped. B: He, he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math, A: Uh-huh. B: and they recently released him from, resource, which I'm, I was thrilled, A: Oh, great. B: I really was. B: I, I just thought that was so neat, that they got him over that hump. B: And, um, he's in the Herman Method of Reading. B: I don't know if you're, familiar with that. A: No, A: that's something new to me. A: I'm, B: It is something new, B: and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters. A: Oh. B: Um, A: I think I read about that in the paper. B: It's wonderful. A: Doctor Haggard is, is heading that up. B: Yes, B: and it's wonderful. B: He didn't have a problem with reading. B: As a matter of fact, he's reading on level. B: The problem was his spelling. B: And, you know, in, in watching the way he has struggled, A: Uh-huh. B: it's interesting, because I'm convinced I have the same learning disability, or had, that was ignored. A: Oh. B: And, A: Right, A: so you worked, you learned how to solve your problems on your own. B: That's right. B: And, and so it's, you know, it's not an intelligence problem. B: It's just a problem with learning. A: Has, has he had this since kindergarten, A: or is this something that maybe learning phonetics, A: and then he just didn't learn the right way? B: Well, you know, it's funny. B: When, um, when he was in first grade, he had trouble with, with spelling, A: Uh-huh. B: and I would say to the teacher, you know, it's amazing. B: He will be able to, B: you'll say to him, spell cat, B: and, you know, he'll say C A T, B: and then he would go to write it, B: and he would write C O T. A: Okay. B: And I kept saying to the teacher, something is wrong here. B: Something is wrong here. A: You're right, right. B: And the teacher kept saying, oh, he has a May birthday. B: He's just immature. A: Right. B: Well, second grade it was, B: I will, B: these teachers as far as I'm concerned are absolute saints, because in second grade, it was about the second week of school, I went up there, B: and I, I requested a conference and, because all year long they kept telling me I was crazy. A: Good, A: good, A: that's great for parents to be involved. B: Well, I was, B: and I, and I went up there the second week of school B: and I said, you know, something is wrong, B: and thank God the the head teacher, the team leader, was a special education major. A: Oh, how great. B: It was, it was B: and, She had picked it up, A: So she, she was able to zero in. B: yep, A: Oh. B: she had already picked it up. B: And she said, you know, we, we were going to call you if you hadn't called us. B: We think there's a learning disability B: and we think he needs to be tested immediately, because, you know, once the first report card comes in, they, have all these people being tested, A: Huh. B: and she said, I think we can get him real fast. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: And sure enough, they tested him B: and, you know, he qualified for, for the help, B: and it's been great, B: and I, and I thank God I'm here, because I, I know I have a sister who has the other extreme. B: She has a, a child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted, B: and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her. A: Right. A: Oh, no. B: And, and to me that's the same thing. B: It's, it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored, this poor gifted child is being ignored. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Right, A: but that's something that parents, I think, are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child. B: That's true. A: So, because, that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home B: That's true. B: Uh-huh. A: but learning disability, unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that, then it makes it real difficult B: Uh-huh. A: and this is, this to me is the benefit I see in public schools is that, that, uh, you do have government money to fund, the kinds of programs that these students need, B: Yes. B: Right. B: Right. A: and I'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem, they test kids before they take them, B: Exactly, B: and, They don't take them, A: and if they're a behavior problem, they're out. B: that's right. A: That, A: and, and, uh, this is kind of a rejection type of thing, B: Right. B: Uh-huh. A: and, and we get it even at our level in, in, A: to know except about what it, about what concerns them. A: Yeah. B: And these are the people that make the foreign policy B: and it, it's probably basically, uh, B: I would not be surprised if the Kennedy Foundation or some of those don't have a lot of, uh, financial holdings in, in Central and South America. A: Probably. B: Considering the Kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway. A: Huh. B: Every time you drink Scotch, you're paying Kennedys. A: I don't drink Scotch. B: Good. B: Don't ever drink Scotch, B: it's terrible. B: I quit drinking Scotch when I found out about that, B: but, anyway. B: But, uh, as far as, as far as, you know, Central and South America, we, our policy pretty much, uh, it depends on who we're, what government we're buying down there at the particular time. A: Yeah. A: I, think we're trying to stay, uh, stay friendly with uh, the, uh, the Brazilian and, and Argentinean governments because they're producing so much, uh, agricultural exports. B: We, A: We, don't want to piss them off and have them over produce B: Yeah. B: Although we do need to do something about, you know, B: of course, in Nicaragua and around there with the Sandinistas and the Contras, that's been going on for years. B: But then, hell, it's probably still be going on long after we're dead. B: It'll still be the same thing. B: Those people down there don't really, B: I mean, A: I think it's going to have to get worse before it gets better, A: you know, the same old cliche. B: Well, I think basically, they can't figure out what they want down there. A: Right. B: If you give everybody what they wanted there is a complete democracy, those people wouldn't know how to react because they have no education. A: Right. A: And they'll just pick crooked people again. A: And then people, the, the wrong people will just fight their way up to the top again, A: and it'll all, be for nothing. B: It's all tradition. B: It's all traditional. B: They have to, B: you have the ruling class B: and you have everybody else. A: Yeah. A: Well, I guess that's about five minutes. A: Appreciate talking, to you. B: was very pleasant)). B: All righty. B: Good, talking to you. A: Hey, what was that book, A: what was that book that you were saying to read, again? B: Tom, Clancy. B: It's called A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. A: A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. B: Uh-huh. B: He he's the one who wrote, uh, RED OCTOBER, A HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. A: Okay. A: All right. B: And I think if you read that, I think you'll get a real kick out of it. A: All right. A: Thanks a lot. B: All righty. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye. A: Um, B: Hi A: one thing you know that I always think about when I think of public education A: cause I went through the public, um, school system of Boston, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, I always felt that I graduated high school A: and I still didn't even I, I couldn't put together a map of the United State. B: Um. A: You know what I mean. B: Uh-huh. A: An yet I felt that I got a good education A: and I, I did well in school A: but you tell me to name, you know, five continents A: an I, couldn't do it. B: Uh-huh. A: I just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education, B: Uh. A: and the people are, are leaving school not even knowing some common sense things. B: Yeah. B: One, B: well, talking about public education, um, I'm, we're doing a proposal, A: Uh-huh. B: it's, we're doing it at N C State, A: Yeah. B: we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum, A: Uh-huh. B: So that's kind of in a higher level A: Right. B: So it's interesting that you chose that topic A: Yeah, A: um, did you do through a public school system or private? B: Yeah, B: well, I went through private an until ninth grade. A: Uh-huh, A: did you notice a big difference? B: Oh, yeah, B: a big difference. A: Like in what sense? B: Well, um, in, uh, public schools I guess there there are a lot of, of, you know, B: people can take lower level courses an get away with learning nothing. A: Uh-huh. B: But, um, private school you couldn't do that, A: Uh-huh. B: you had to learn. A: Yeah, A: I work in a temporary agency A: an they're people that come in, you know, every day to fill out an application, B: Uh-huh. A: and they'll have to bring somebody with them, A: and they will show that they completed, um, four year of high school, A: yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application, they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves, B: Uh. B: That's bad. A: it's just incredible. B: Yeah, B: our State cut a whole bunch of a, I think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget. A: Really. B: So they're making all kind of cuts B: in college people cannot, I mean, the teachers can't make tests any more, B: and the library canceling all of it's subscriptions. A: Yeah. B: It's pretty sorry. A: I know, A: um, they, uh, A: I forget A: I think it's, um, some place in New York because they're having budget problems, they're closing the libraries. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports, or anything like that, B: Uh. A: they're not cutting in any other corner A: they're closing the libraries. A: That to me shows a little, uh, switch in priorities. B: Yeah. A: You know. A: So do you go to college right now? A: Are B: Yeah, B: it's my last year A: You're a, so you're a senior now. B: Yeah, B: I'm working on my projects trying to graduate A: Oh, good for you. B: Yeah. A: That's great, A: um, is, is N C University is that, uh, State, B: N C State. A: What did you say? B: N C State. A: N C State, A: that's a State University then. B: Yeah. A: I see. A: And you're from there also? B: Well, yeah, B: I was, uh, I was born in B: and then I lived in most of my life. A: Uh-huh. A: I see. B: And now I'm back here going to school. A: Well, pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college. B: Yeah. A: It's just a outrageously expensive. B: Luckily state is one of the cheap ones. A: Oh is it. B: Yeah. A: Well, still though A: I mean, you know, thousands of dollars, B: Yeah, state's not that bad A: Oh, well, that's good. B: Yeah. A: That's good. A: I went to a private university A: and, um, I don't know A: I look back now A: and I, I think that I probably would have done it differently if I, um, you know, could do it over again. B: Yeah. A: But, um, I have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didn't even go to school, some, some of them, A: and I still feel like they came out knowing just as much as I did. A: I really do A: and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say A: but, um, B: Yeah, A: I don't know, A: I, I B: Where did you go? A: what? B: Where did you go? A: I went to University. B: Uh-huh. A: It's in Massachusetts. A: And, um, I really felt like I've been working now for about four years, B: Uh-huh. A: and I, I feel like what I've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school. B: Oh. A: And I know that I'm drawing a lot of what I learned in school, you know, A: I, I probably just subconsciously rely a lot on, on art. A: But, um, I don't know A: my sister's a principal at a school, A: and one thing she's trying to instill in kids, um, besides just reading and writing are just some, the golden rules, B: Uh-huh. A: she calls them just some basics about, um, you know, you don't take what's not yours, A: uh, and if you want to, you know, you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission. A: Like no hitting, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: no pulling hair or anything like that, A: and, uh, the school that she's in is a, um, it's basically for minorities, A: um, there's a large minority population. A: And, um, she's really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there A: I think they don't value that type of student as much as you get, in some. B: Yeah B: that's, sorry. B: That they, that they like pick on the advanced students and pay more attention to them, ignore the others. A: Yeah, A: it's true. A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: And I don't know if it makes them feel better A: I mean the do teachers get, A: I mean personally I would get more satisfaction out of taking someone that wasn't as successful. B: Yeah. A: And seeing what they could do verses somebody that did excel in, in areas and just watching them get better, you know. B: Yeah. A: That's not much of a challenge. B: That's true. A: But do you have any ideal what you're going into when you graduate. B: Um, graduate school A: Oh yeah. B: Yeah. A: Do you know where you're going? B: I think I'm going to Chappel Hill. A: Where's that? B: That's in Chappel Hill B: the A: Oh is that North Carolina? B: Yeah. A: Oh, okay. B: Never heard of the, uh, Tarheels? A: No, A: I don't know that area. B: The A C C Tarheels, U N C? A: I know it. B: Oh, uh, A: I don't get down there very often. B: They won the final four, in boy's basket ball. A: Oh, really, A: well the way I pick the final four was, um, by the state that had the warmest climate. B: Uh-huh. A: So that's how I chose all mine, A: so you can tell that I really didn't have that much to do with any of it. A: But, A: so obviously you're into education. B: Yeah. A: If you can be going, A: my husband went to, is in graduate school actually right now. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, A: I don't know A: I give you a lot of credit. A: I couldn't do it, A: I, I couldn't wait to graduate and have, it be all over. B: Yeah, B: I know. B: Oh. B: I can't wait to graduate either, now. A: I know. B: I've got all of this stuff due B: oh wow. B: Overloaded. A: Yeah, A: I kind of know what you mean. A: Well, it was really nice talking to you. B: All right. A: Okay. A: Good luck. B: All right, B: thank you. A: All righty, A: take care. B: All right, B: bye. A: Bye-bye. B: Clanking ishes oman and children A: Well, as much as I'd, uh, I'd like to say that I'll be looking for a flashy convertible or, uh, or a four by four or something, A: I guess the next car I'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door B: What kind of a car do you have now? A: Oh, we've got a, uh, an older Delta Eighty-Eight, A: and then, uh, our, our newer car is a, uh, a Corsica. B: Yeah. A: And we'll probably be looking for something about that, uh, that same style. B: Yeah. A: That same kind of four door, hard top style. B: You got kids? A: Uh, no A: but we're planning for it. B: Okay. A: So, uh, in fact, uh, our Oldsmobile is a, is a like an old Delta Eighty-Eight A: but it's in pretty good in really good shape. B: Yeah. A: And we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles. B: Yeah. A: So that's probably where the first place we'd look. B: Huh. A: But, uh, B: Well, we've always had, uh, Fords. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership A: That'll do it. B: Yeah. B: That'll do it. B: Um, but, yeah, we're, we're in the same shape. B: I think our next car will be a, you know, some big old four door, uh, something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons, A: Yeah. B: and we've got a minivan, A: Uh-huh. B: and that's great. B: And I drive, uh, B: well I used to drive an Escort, B: but it died on me. B: So I, I mean I, I, I used to run it, I, uh, where we used to live, I used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day. A: Oh, geez. B: And, uh, and this Escort took it all. B: And it, it, it got up to, uh, uh, I was at ninety-four thousand miles on it, B: and the engine just went. A: Uh-huh. B: So I, I, I bought a used, uh, Dodge Aries, which has been okay. A: Yeah. A: Really? B: I, I mean I've haven't had it that long. A: Uh-huh. B: But it, it it's an eighty-five Aries, B: but it only had thirty-four thousand miles on it when I bought it. A: Oh, geez. B: And I just, you know, I just drive it to work. B: So it's just a ten minute commute every day. A: Uh-huh. B: So, uh, it doesn't get much of, uh, B: I mean, it's not like I'm putting it through its paces. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: But I think, uh, B: and it's a four door which is nice, A: Uh-huh. B: but it's still a little cramped. B: I've got three kids, A: Yeah. B: so I, I, A: Sounds like you, you need at least like a Taurus size, or something like that. B: Yeah, B: that's what, I was thinking of, B: was a Taurus. B: Uh, A: Yeah. A: I, I know a lot of guys at work, A: they, uh, the ones that have, uh, families, uh, A: and they still want kind of a sports car. A: They've been, uh, a lot of them have been getting these Taurus S H O's. A: That I guess it's the sports version of the Taurus? B: Oh, really? B: Yeah A: In fact, it comes with a standard stick A: and, uh, and a lot of those. B: Ooh. A: And it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that. A: But, uh, B: Yeah. A: and usually they're in like black, and gun metal grey and those kind of colors. A: You're not going to see too many, uh, you know, green ones or blue ones or anything like that. B: Yeah. A: They, they put them in sporty colors I guess. A: But, uh, B: Yeah. B: Well, my wife wants a Miyata. A: Oh, well sure A: That's what, you know, A: until, until you look at the price tag A: and then you go, What? B: Right. A: What would I, besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun, what would I really do with this car? B: Right, B: yeah. B: I know, B: I know. B: It's like I, I guess I could fit in it maybe A: Yeah. A: I, I went, I went through that when I first got out of, uh, college. A: I had an old car that I bought just to get to, to my my first job. B: Yeah. A: And when I got there, the first thing I did was trade it in on a Spitfire. B: Oh. A: And I, I knew that was going to be the only time I could afford a two seater, uh, sports car. B: Yeah. A: But that, that just does not make it as an only car. A: It's, uh, it's like I, I would, A: I bought a set of stereo speakers B: Yeah. A: and it was one of those cash and carry deals. A: I had to take them one at a time, with the top down. A: And it was winter, so I was in like this coat with the top down, B: Oh, no! A: and the speaker in the passenger seat. B: Yeah A: And I drove that one home, A: and then I went back and got the other one and put that in the, passenger seat and drove that one home. A: And, uh, funny, funniest sight. A: And you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Well, I, B: you know, it's funny. B: Most people that I've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college, or, you know, or when they were single anyway. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: They'd, they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last. B: I never did that. B: Uh, you know, my first car was a Toyota Corolla. A: Oh, really? B: And, uh, because I got a good deal on it A: Yeah. B: and, uh, that was a great little car. B: Actually I met, B: that's how I met girls was, I'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission, which I, I had never, B: I, I'd learned on an automatic transmission. And so, so I'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car. A: Uh-huh. A: Boy, that's a good deal. B: And, uh, in fact I married one of those people A: Ah, okay. A: Well, I'll have to remember that if I ever get in that situation again B: And it worked. B: Yeah, B: it worked all right, real good. A: Huh. A: Because I, I know we've, uh, A: that's, that's something that, that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission. A: My, uh, my wife just can't, can't, uh, A: she really doesn't want to learn I guess, the, uh, the standard shift. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: I fact, I, I remember once we, uh, we, uh, went, uh, went on a, uh, test drive. A: We got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said, you know, I'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll test drive a car. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: And we went, uh, we went, uh, we went to a dealership A: and, uh, it, it was she, she did pretty well. A: But it was one of those things where we just went to a big parking lot B: Yeah A: and the, uh, dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking, A: because that was all it was. A: It was, it was the funniest thing, A: it was like, uh, a big Le Baron, A: it was a Le Baron with everything on it, B: Wow! A: but it had a standard shift. A: It was the craziest thing I ever saw. B: That's weird! B: Yeah. A: And, and, and that's probably why they were trying to sell them, I guess. B: Huh. A: And, uh, we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth. A: She did pretty well after a while. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, it's just kind of hard to learn, I guess. B: Well, my wife, B: I mean, she'd always driven standard transmission. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, and, B: in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission. B: In fact, the minivan's a, has a stick shift. A: Um, okay. B: And in, B: this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything. B: You know, it's got automatic transmission, cruise control, you know, electric locks. A: Oh, geez. B: You know, it's like, it's like a luxury car except that it's the Dodge Aries you know. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: So, uh, A: Oh, well. A: Well, I guess that's, I guess that's about all I've got to say, about cars B: Well, you, um, B: the, the thing about this, uh, B: I will say this about the minivan. A: Uh-huh. B: We thought that was a luxury car when we bought it. A: Uh-huh, A: I would think so, A: yeah, B: It, it, A: because it's so big. B: Yeah. B: And, and it was quiet, B: it had a stereo system. A: Oh, yeah. B: We never had it, you know, B: we always had the A M radio. A: Sure, A: sure. B: And, uh, of course this has, this that had speakers that you can control from the back seat. A: Uh-huh. B: And you can change the channels on the, on the radio from the back seat too A: Uh-huh. B: And put speaker phones in it. B: So. A: Now, now, now that used to be a luxury, A: but I bet on the next time you buy a car, that's going to be mandatory. B: Right. A: You've got to have that now. B: That's right. B: That's right. A: You're used to it A: and you got to have it. B: And you've got to pay for it too. A: Yeah. A: That's true too. B: And I bet, and I bet it costs twice as much as, as when I bought mine A: It, It probably does, A: it probably does. A: But, uh, B: We, A: Oh, well. A: Well, Bill it's been nice talking to you. B: Nice talking to you. A: Okay, A: you have a good evening. B: Thanks a lot. A: Um. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye-bye A: What kind, B: What kind of cars do you, do you usually drive? A: Right now we, I've got a, uh, four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda. B: Oh, my goodness. B: Well, we're, we're, we're sort of, sort of a General Motors family, B: I guess that's the way we were raised. B: And, uh, uh, we were overseas with T I for a number of years B: and when we came back we suddenly find out we've got five licensed drivers in the family. A: Oh, goodness. B: Yeah, B: and four cars B: and we bought some year old cars from National Car Rental. A: Really? B: At least two of them. B: We bought an Olds Calais and a Buick Skylark. B: Uh, for, you know, B: they each had twenty-one thousand miles or something like that. A: Uh-huh. B: Turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them B: and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that. B: Uh, then we've got an eighty-six Chevy Spectrum that we bought new. B: My daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her. A: Uh-huh. B: And we've got a eighty-four Toyota that we bought used. B: So we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers. B: It's like musical chairs A: I bet. B: You're one short. A: I bet. B: And, uh, B: but you know, it's interesting the two, B: even though my dad was a Chevrolet man forever and ever and ever B: and we were in the retail milk business B: and he had all Chevrolet milk trucks B: and, and we bought automobiles and all that, B: it was almost like B: and a Chevrolet dealer was our friend B: and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a, but a Chevrolet it would be like going and spitting on his grave B: But, uh, A: Yep. B: as we got older and got away, B: and then we thought, well, you know, you still could buy General Motors products B: and it was probably not that bad. B: But, uh, we lived in Malaysia for T I in nineteen, uh, eighty-one, two, three, and four. A: Uh-huh. B: And, and, of course you don't buy General Motors products over there A: No. B: But we bought a Volvo B: and I have never had a car that I've loved more. B: I just can't afford them here. B: Uh, but I, I just loved that car. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, we bought a, uh, B: we lived in the Philippines for T I in eighty-five, eighty-six, and eighty-seven B: and we bought a, uh, Ford Telstar, B: which is somewhat similar to the Taurus. B: It's sold in, uh, in uh, the Far Eastern uh, Far East countries more than here. A: Uh-huh. B: But we really liked that. B: And have you had experience with cars other than the ones you have? A: Well, yeah A: we had, uh, we had, A: these are the first cars that my husband and I have ever purchased ourselves. B: Um. A: The others were hand me downs through the families. B: Yeah. A: And those were always G M cars. B: Yeah. A: Uh, Buicks and Chevrolets. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, we were real happy with them, A: but all the ones that we ever had were the, you know, eight cylinder, B: Oh, yeah. A: really rugged, G M cars. B: The the big, B: Yeah. A: And all we had heard was, was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars, A: and we both drive, well, forty-five miles round trip every day. B: Sure, B: sure. A: And so we wanted a smaller car, B: Yeah. A: when we got ready to buy, we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage A: and quite frankly, we were afraid of the, of the G M small cars. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: You know, as far as durability. B: Right. A: So we kind of, A: when we had our larger cars, we didn't mind, uh, keeping them up, B: Uh-huh. A: you know, doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often. B: Yeah. A: But, once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them, all of them, you know, A: it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: it seems that something goes every month. A: Yeah A: it, B: And I'm afraid we're going to be in that in another year with all of ours, B: you know, B: we got three eighty-sixes and an eighty-four A: Uh-huh. B: And we'll probably be there with all of them. B: You know, it's the same thing, you know, B: I don't know whether, uh, you classify the Skylark and the Calais as, B: well I guess they're intermediate. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, but, uh, we went on a family trip to Massachusetts B: and there were five of us B: and five, five of us never go anywhere together here. B: everybody's heading off in their own direction. A: Right. B: And I rented a Buick Le Sabre, A: Uh-huh. B: and it's the first big car I had since I had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy-six to eighty. B: And it made all the, B: I, I had forgotten what driving a big car was like. A: It's like a yacht. B: It was just nice. B: It floated. A: Yeah. A: What, A: we, we sold or we, we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru. B: Oh, yeah. A: Yeah, A: it was a great car. B: Yeah. A: It just, A: we ran the wheels right off of it. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: yeah. B: And, uh, you know I've read, B: I'm in the quality business at T I, B: I'm a quality manager B: and we're, we're uh, we deal, B: we sell, B: I'm in the semiconductor group B: and we sell to, uh, Ford, Chrysler and G M, uh, G M Delco. A: Uh-huh. B: And there is a, amazing, B: I am just, uh, really impressed with the, with the quality consciousness that the, these companies have put into their procurement B: and it's, I, it's come out as a result of the competition from the Japanese. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, uh, I B: and, you know, we used to think Ford products were tinny. B: I mean I was growing up, B: I was taught when I was growing up, you know, that, that that real people bought General Motors products, B: and peons bought, Ford products. A: That's right. B: But just with the quality requirements that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants B: and they're really, uh, uh, stressing this partnerships in quality, B: and you know, G M and Chrysler are doing that, B: but I really think Ford's got a ship position in this right now. B: And I think it's showing up in their automobiles. B: Their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, uh, we went to, uh, Austin a while back to a basketball tournament B: and we were going to be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there, B: so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down, we'd rent one, A: Uh-huh. B: and we went up to the local Budget B: and we were going to get a Olds eighty-eight or something. B: He said I'll tell you what, for a dollar a day more I'll give you a Lincoln Town Car. A: Um. B: And we drove that down B: and I hated to turn that back in. A: I bet B: We had that for three days. B: And I absolutely loved, B: except I couldn't want to have to park it in tight places all the time. A: No. B: Uh, A: I wouldn't want to have to pay for the gas, either. B: but I absolutely loved that automobile. B: And, you know, it wasn't that I'd, B: driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon, B: but on the trip down and back I filled up both coming and going B: so I knew what I actually got on the trip B: and it was about twenty-four miles a gallon. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, and, you know, we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it, let it float. A: Uh-huh. B: And, it was pretty nice. B: Are, are, are you planning on getting any additional or other cars? A: No time soon. A: Uh, we're, our, our, we won't have any more licensed drivers for about thirteen years. B: Um. B: Oh, yours is small. A: Yes. A: So, we, uh, so we don't plan on purchasing any more any time soon. A: Both of our cars are getting, oh, around sixty thousand miles on them. B: Um. B: Oh, yeah. A: We drive a lot. B: Yeah. B: You got another, another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, we've got, B: probably we'll get something in the next couple years. B: My son will graduate from high school this year, B: and, and he's going to go to Richland College one year behind us, A: Uh-huh. B: it's right, B: in fact, uh, our house is adjacent to the Richland property. B: He wants to go to Texas Tech B: and he's probably going to have to go to Richland a year to get some grades in order, B: but, uh, the next year when he goes out to Tech, he wants a pickup, B: and I want, a pickup. A: A pickup aint. B: I may get one and not let him have it B: But, we have been looking at these red B: they, they're very popular around here. A: Uh-huh. B: These, uh, uh, red Chevy pickups, B: and, uh, we'll probably do something like that, B: uh, uh, incidentally, B: uh, uh, I don't know, B: uh, the, uh, the Credit Union has got a deal now where you decide what you want B: and you call this number B: and, uh, they go negotiate the price for you. B: And, and, or, or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, my boss just bought a Chevy pickup B: and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way. A: Really? B: Yeah. B: And, uh, uh, you know, you, you figure out the options, go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and, and tell him what you want B: and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy, a certain person at that dealer's place. A: Uh-huh. B: So I'm going to try that the next time I buy one. A: I think that would be a good idea. B: And, and, so, you know, I can go around and comparison shop and see if I can get a better negotiation on my own. B: But, once, one thing that's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating. A: Yeah. A: I've, we've, we've, we've kind of been the types that will say, this is what we intend to spend, B: Yeah. A: this is the car we want, A: will you sell me this car for that price. B: And for that price. A: And, and we've had A: we, with our, A: when we bought our Subaru, the guy was like, you can't do this to me, A: and we're were just, like, okay fine, we, we won't then. B: We'll go somewhere else. B: Yeah. A: You know. A: I mean he's like, no, no, no. B: Yeah. A: But, B: And, uh, and I, I think that's probably the way you've got to do it. B: When, when I was young, I went in and bought a, uh, or made a deal on a sixty, B: this is nineteen sixty, B: I'd first come to Texas, and made a deal on a sixty red Impala convertible that I just loved, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and this guy gave me this deal, you know, B: I told him how much I wanted to pay, B: and for every fifty dollars he'd have to go in and check with the boss B: and then I'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate, uh, we would go ahead and buy. B: Uh, uh, if he could get this rate I promised to buy B: and I left there on a Saturday afternoon just totally exhausted. B: I, I was only twenty-five years old or something A: Uh-huh. B: I, I left there B: and I, I, uh, I'd never done this before because I'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from, B: and, uh, uh, so I, I got back B: and a salesman that lived in the apartment had, asked me, uh, uh, if, B: he'd heard I was going to get a car, and asked me what I paid for it. B: He said, well, hey, uh, before you go buying anything, B: he says call this friend of mine at Will's Point. B: There was a guy that owned a Chevrolet dealership up there. A: Uh-huh. B: And I called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning B: and just driving fifty miles out of town, it was a difference, B: and, I mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars, B: but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty-five hundred, A: Goodness. B: is all we paid for cars in those days. B: And, uh, uh, so I called back the guy in Dallas B: and I told him that, B: I'd left him a check for tax, title and license and everything, B: and I said I want to cancel my order and, and don't try to cash the check because I'm going to, I've stopped payment on it already B: and he says oh, somebody's taking, B: he said what did you get a deal for, Bill. B: And I told him, B: he says, somebody's taking you for a ride. B: And I said, no somebody took me for a ride last Saturday A: That's right. B: And, uh, uh, and I, I find that, uh, B: and for the longest time then I drove up to Will's Point B: and, and the, and the fellow died since then, B: and, and some of his relatives have taken over the business B: and that, B: but B: and, since then I had ... B: Okay, B: well yes, B: we do have pollution in Houston B: and it, A: How bad is it? A: Do you have smog like they do in California? B: Well it, it B: some, B: I think it depends on, uh, you know, what the, the cloud cover B: and like right now, it's, uh, it's kind of overcast, you know, B: just, it's hot, A: Uh-huh. B: and the sun is trying, tries to shine through B: but it's, it's holding in this, this pollution B: and I, A: It depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion, I take it. B: I think so, B: and, uh, A: Yeah. B: and we have, uh, Pasadena, Texas which is sort of between here an, you know, heading toward Galveston, B: I mean it's still part of, it's part of the Houston metroplex. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: What do you think is your primary cause of it. B: Well, I think it's industry B: and I think it's cars. A: You do? A: You really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas? B: I don't, I, B: well maybe not, B: but, it, it sure, it sure, B: you know, it, B: I, I know that when I'm, when I'm behind a car B: and, uh, sometimes, uh, I can really smell especially diesel and things like that, A: Uh-huh. B: you know, comes right into my air conditioner B: and, you know, my head and my B: I'm so stopped up right now, A: Um, A: my goodness. B: I don't know if it's, uh, if it's partly from what's blooming, you know, right now, pollen and stuff like that, B: that's part of it, B: but, um. A: Uh-huh. A: I think a lot of it's industrial. A: I also think, uh, that, uh, there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles A: but it's mostly from older automobiles. A: I don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting, uh, frankly. B: Uh-huh. A: I think that, uh, I think that, uh, uh, A: if, uh, A: I, I, I heard a story a while back A: something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent, or, take all the cars off the road that have been, uh, manufactured say before nineteen seventy-five, that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining. B: Uh-huh. B: You mean, uh, fifty percent pollution total from that comes from, A: Yeah. A: From, from cars A: that is, not, not total but just from cars, A: okay. B: Oh, uh-huh. A: So, that I think would be tremendous help. A: But I happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical A: and it just keeps getting, uh, gives me good service A: and I don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money. B: Uh-huh. A: On the other hand I know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars I have. B: Uh-huh. A: But I don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies. B: Right. A: And, uh, that may be part of the problem. B: Do you all have pollution in your part of the country, uh, from industry? A: Yeah, ause A: yeah, A: yeah, A: oh, uh, yeah, A: it's, it's, uh, pretty heavy up here I think A: but I think it's mostly industrial, is what I really, uh, believe is the, the main problem. A: And, and, uh, ause A: and, uh, uh, people, uh, I don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should. A: I, I we, we seem to have a high, uh, cancer rate up here in Maryland. B: Really, A: Yeah, A: and, uh, B: like what B: any particular kind or just all kinds? A: Well, for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant A: and, uh, I think, A: of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody, A: but, uh, this state was like the second, A: my wife's a registered nurse, A: and I think this state was like second this year from the top, in terms of, uh, cancer rate for just all kinds. A: And I can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution. A: I just don't know exactly what it necessarily is, A: but I just can't believe it is. B: Um. A: Now we have a lot of pollution being caused by uh, fluorocarbons which is the, like freon twelve and freon twenty-two. A: They use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps, B: Uh-huh. A: and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners A: and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer. B: Uh-huh. A: And I can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer, that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also, A: and having all kinds of effects, A: and. B: Well what can we do about the, the, the, the air conditioning problem? A: Well they're working now, A: I know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working, uh, feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons, B: Uh-huh. A: and who ever does is going to make, uh, a mint. A: Because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons, then, uh, B: Is that also what's in, uh, aerosol? A: Well they used to be, A: but they made them take it out of that. B: Even, so, so the aerosol is still aerosol, A: Right. B: but it doesn't have anything that's damaging. A: No, A: they, they, they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers, B: Uh-huh, B: well that's good. A: and that was a move in the right direction. A: We are doing some things to try to correct the problem. A: But there are more things we could do A: and getting rid of old cars, like I said is one way to help correct the problem. A: Uh, uh, just trying to I think be careful, uh, with the way you handle garbage, A: I notice in this state, A: I don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not, A: but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces, uh, you know, containers in, A: yeah. B: Here, they've just started, started doing that, B: it's, it's, you know, B: you're not, you don't have to, B: but you know, B: I know I am. B: I save, A: Yeah, A: well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too. A: But they, uh, A: in one of the counties here, they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police. A: They have a lady that goes around like a meter maid A: and she spot checks people's trash. B: No kidding, B: really, B: oh. A: And if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash, they'll fine you fifty bucks I think the first time and two fifty the second time. B: Is that right. B: Well, we need to do something, B: we need to get serious about it. A: Yeah, A: you, A: right, A: you've got to get people to see A: and surprisingly enough just handling of trash, uh, can cut pollution, uh, from, uh, uh, from just throwing it in a dump, or, or, or, where ever else they used to do with it, maybe used to burn it. A: They've stopped that up here too. B: Uh-huh. A: But that, that will cut pollution too. A: Because you get a lot of out gassing from these things, I think, decaying and and trying to, A: for instance cans and bottles, they never go away at all. B: Uh-huh. A: But on, on the other hand, I don't guess they're polluting. A: But plastic containers and the like, uh, they may be, A: I'm not sure of that. B: How much does, uh, planting more trees and things like that help? A: Oh I think that's very important to do. B: too. A: I, I really think that, uh, trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very, very important thing. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, that can help to cut pollution, I guess some. A: I, I don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air. A: I would hope that they would help some, though. A: That's for sure. B: I think, uh, it seems like there was something going on, around here, that, you know, B: we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff, A: Uh-huh. B: and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out, you know, like in the middle of the night, they would go ahead and do it anyway. B: I think they got caught. A: Oh good. B: But I wonder how much of that kind of stuff, you know, goes on. A: Well that, uh, that I think may go on a lot A: and the primary reason I think it may go on a lot is just as you said, somebody happened to stay up late at night or something. A: I don't think we have a adequate policing, uh, particularly on industry. A: Uh, we have good policing, at least in this state and, and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too, of car pollutants A: because we have to go down, uh, once a year here in Maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content. B: Uh, we have to, uh, we have to have a state inspection every year. A: Uh-huh. B: Do you all have that? A: Uh, no, A: we don't have a state inspection, B: So, B: which I, B: I B: I would A: but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state. B: So I'm I'm assuming that, you know, they check, they check everything for safety B: or, A: I don't know, A: uh, that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities. A: But in this state we have to, uh, pay eight dollars and a half and go to a, an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are, have been made starting in nineteen seventy-three. B: But that's all they check for, B: they don't check how good, B: if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough. A: No, A: no, A: we don't have inspections like that. A: Now, I'm in Maryland, A: in Virginia they check that every two years, I think. B: We do that every year. A: And I think that's a good idea too, A: not, not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily, A: but I think it's a good idea. A: The emission check, though, is required in Maryland A: and it's also required in Virginia, uh, a sister state to, to this one. A: And that's, that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants. B: Well I'll have to check, B: I'm not sure if, if our state inspection B: once a year has to do, you know, B: if they check the, uh, A: Uh-huh, A: well if they don't I would imagine in time they'll get a law with. get around to it, A: and if they don't then that's something I would certainly, uh, uh, suggest you be willing to uh, uh, be for in terms of, uh, B: Oh, I would A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: I'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or, or, or anything. A: Oh yeah, A: I, I agree. A: Now that's another area we haven't even discussed A: and that is water pollution and various of the other types of, uh, of, uh, like food pollution. A: I mean you, you hardly ever hear, hear anybody say anything about food pollution. A: But I think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries, A: so, uh, hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of, uh, pollutants in our food. A: But water pollution, uh, A: I've worried, especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like. B: Uh-huh. A: I know a lot more people are going to bottled water. B: Well B: and that's not necessarily the answer either B: because they've found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap. A: Yeah, A: tap, A: yeah B: So, B: but a lot of these, uh, B: some of this B: well, you know, a lot of people have well water, B: in fact in this area too B: and, an, you know, B: and, uh, A: Uh-huh. B: if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're, what you're drinking B: and I, I know a lot of people, you know, have that B: and, you know, you have to wonder if that, you know could have an adverse affect on them too, if they don't, they don't get it checked. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course, have it checked A: because it seems, uh, A: when I was a kid growing up down south, uh, I used to go out in the country where my grandparents were A: and we had a well, A: it was one of those draws that, A: I forget what you call those things, B: Uh-huh. A: and, and that was some of the best tasting water, A: I mean, I can still to this day taste that water. B: When we were, B: when I was growing up I lived in Huntsville, Alabama, A: Yeah. B: and their water supply came from, uh, spring. A: Uh-huh. B: And it was like ice cold, spring water B: and I guess parts of the, the city still you know, get that, B: but, uh, that was, that was really wonderful. A: Oh, I bet it was. B: It was really, really good. A: Yeah, A: once it's been filtered an if it's a deep enough well, filtered through all the earth and everything I think that, uh, A: it depends of course where you are. A: A good well, though, I think is very healthy ... A: The Latin American situation in, A: the last development I know of was the military and financial assistance Columbia for the, for the drug, uh, control. B: Uh-huh. A: And I support that fully. A: I'm not sure we have the right solution to it, A: but at least we're, we're going to the source of the problem. A: And, the source of supply. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, the problem is here, A: but the source of supply is there. B: That's true. B: Very definitely so. A: In fact I think a lot of the, A: I've been to, uh, Peru several times. B: Uh-huh. A: I've never been to other parts of South America, A: but, uh, I have been to Peru, A: and they need some assistance down there A: and I'm sure that, uh, as an undeveloped country they look, look for it, A: but there is not exactly a lot of, uh, physical responsibility there. *listen; probably 'fiscal' not 'physical' B: No. B: Very immature in that respect. A: Yes, A: right. A: And I, I think that, uh, they need guidance and assistance, A: but they need to learn how to stand on their own, own two feet also. B: I agree. B: I think that for so long power financially, uh, governmentally, every which way was in the hands of such a few that there's not the middle class that we, we perceive. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, no, the, and the poor are extremely poor. A: I know, B: Are extremely poor. B: That's correct. A: I know, uh, some of the areas in, in Texas seem poor, A: but until you've seen some of those, uh, native, Latin Americans come down from the hills, you can't imagine what poor is. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, the worst scene I've ever had I think was, uh, someone eating out of, out of a garbage can on the streets in Lima, Peru. B: And, and just very happy to get that. A: Oh, yes. A: Yes. B: I have a brother who spent two years in Bolivia. A: Uh-huh. B: And this is very much his, you know, reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor. A: Oh, the, there's a joke, A: the, the graft and the, uh, payoffs down there are are an accepted way A: and, in a way, B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: And there's, there's a sad joke. A: I guess all jokes are really sad, A: but there's a joke about the, uh, Ambassador from Latin America that came to visit a Senator in the U S and was taken to his home for dinner A: and the, uh, home was palatial. A: They had five or six servants, you know, and, and, a lot of expensive, uh, holdings and all that, A: and the Ambassador said, but I know what you make as a U S Senator, A: how can you afford all of this? A: And he said, come I'll show you A: and he walked out in the backyard A: and the, uh, Senator said do you see that hospital over there? A: And the Ambassador said, yes. A: And he patted his pocket A: and he said fifteen percent. A: He said, you see that school over there? A: And the Ambassador said, yes, A: and he pot, patted his pocket and said fifteen percent, A: so, B: Oh, gosh. A: so the next year the Senator went to Latin America to visit the Ambassador and was treated to dinner in his home A: and it was twice as large and four times as many servants. A: He said, well I know how poor your country is, A: how can you afford this, uh, in such a poor country, A: and he, he said, come I'll show you A: and he walked out the backyard A: and he said, do you see that hospital over there? A: And the Senator looked A: and he couldn't see anything, A: he said, no. A: And the Ambassador potted, patted his pocket and said one hundred percent A: so, B: Yep A: Yeah, A: that, A: it's a sad story A: but, B: Intentions, intentions A: Yes, A: yes, A: but it, uh, it is a problem. B: I know. B: Uh, I have a sister-in-law who is from Nicaragua B: and her family, B: her father was a fairly, uh, high ranking official under Somoza. B: And when that went down the tubes they had to get out. A: Uh-huh. B: And seventeen children, filtered through into, into America through Guatamala, through Mexico, through Honduras, A: Um. B: you know, two here, three there, one here, you know, this kind of thing until, A: Yeah. B: and now, uh, couple of the older ones stayed or went back, B: but the rest of them now have their American citizenship and are leading productive lives, A: Uh-huh. B: but, you A: Well, the the other instance I think of their inability to, to handle things, the cholera, and hepatitis epidemics now in, in Latin America. B: Yes. A: And it shows the, the unpreparedness for such, such a problem. B: Yes. A: And yet they're so, B: Oh, the stories she tells, you know, are just unnerving just unnerving. A: Yeah. A: And they're, they're so rich in resources there. A: They're very rich in oil and gas. A: And they're very rich in gold and silver, and very rich in, in, uh, natural resources such as the fish and, uh timber, and, and copper and all types of, uh, resources B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: but they, B: And the uranium. A: Yes, A: and, A: but they don't have, A: it's sort of like Russia, A: they don't have the ability to develop it. B: The technology. A: Right. A: And they, they're very, B: Well, B: and, you know, they're very willing to be taught in many cases now, too, B: but, you know, there's just always this kind of resentment underlying B: I think that when they receive help from us, they want it, B: but, they don't want it, I mean A: kindergarten like about two thirty. B: And I had to leave work. B: It was, it was five o'clock in the evening B: and I found out he was still there at school. B: And they were calling me B: and they said somebody's got to pick him up. B: And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up, she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school. B: I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff. B: And he had a hundred and four fever. B: They couldn't, uh, give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything. A: Right. B: I was so furious. B: I, I quit that job B: and I stayed home for awhile longer. B: Then I went and got a, uh, a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better. A: Yeah, A: a little more flexibility. A: You can come and go. B: Yeah, B: but, uh, I haven't had any good, really very good experience with child care A: Yeah. A: When, when our kids were small we had a couple of, uh, good, good women who, uh, would often uh, get them to come to the house. A: So, who's your favorite team? B: My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers. A: Pittsburgh? B: You bet. A: I used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little. B: Well, I, uh, B: when played he was from my hometown in Alabama, A: Oh, really? B: so I kind of grabbed on to that team, way back when. A: Huh. A: pretty A: that's good. A: I, I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain, or steel curtain. B: That's right. B: How about your favorite team? A: Huh. A: Well, last year it was Buffalo A: and I, I still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just, they just impressed me as being so efficient A: and they never score. A: They never blow out their opponents. A: They just score just enough points, B: Uh-huh. A: and that really impressed me. A: But then down here I A: is pretty close to New Orleans A: and I've been keeping up with the Saints a lot. B: Well, they are exciting, aren't they? A: Yeah, A: the Saints are starting to impress me this year, you know, a lot. B: Boy, B: they are, they are just a fun team to watch. A: This, it, they are really. A: Did you see the game Sunday night or, Sunday afternoon? B: Uh, no, B: I didn't. A: It was funny. A: There were, they uh, a fireworks display at halftime. B: Oh, yeah? A: Yeah, A: and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire. B: Oh, you're kidding A: So, they had to stop the game lieu the third quarter and put out this fire. B: Oh, my A: Those big piece of something came flaming, falling out of the roof and landed on the field A: so there's this big fire on the field A: and they were dumping the bucket and everything. B: Oh, I can't believe that. A: It was A: I mean, you just really can't tell what's going to happen. B: That's hilarious. A: I know. A: It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints. B: Uh-huh. A: And Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal. B: Oh. A: And it, it was beautiful, right down the middle. B: Oh, boy. B: He is tough, B: he has an incredible leg. A: He is. A: Yes. B: Well, do you think they're, they're going to be able to make it this year, past the first playoff game? A: Uh I I sure hope so. A: I'm not sure, I'm not sure who they play. A: Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams. B: Who's that? A: It's pretty much going between Washington. They are undefeated. And, uh, Buffalo, New Orleans, and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice B: Right. A: and one of those was to Buffalo. A: And they beat the Saints. A: Their only time they lost. B: What do you think about, uh, Houston? A: Houston. A: I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis. B: Oh, yeah? A: Yeah. A: Uh, from what I saw they were playing, A: when I was at the game we sat right on the front row, right behind the Houston Oilers, B: Huh. A: and from what I saw the game Houston, Houston impressed me a lot. B: Huh. A: But my brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night, A: and if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night. B: Oh, yeah, B: he's he definitely, uh, is one of the best I think. A: He's, A: Yeah, A: the, their, their backfield is really impressive. A: Haywood and Drew Hill and B: Right. A: they really impress me. B: Well, they squeaked out a game on Sunday. A: That's right. A: Who, who did they play? B: They played Dallas. A: Dallas, A: that's right, B: They won, in overtime. A: all because, A: That's right. A: I remember that now. B: So that was, B: I, I watched that game B: and, uh, that was, uh, A: Do you have a favorite between those two? B: Well, because I'm right here in Dallas I, I kind of pull for Dallas. A: Really? B: Yeah. B: Well, also Houston is, uh, in Pittsburgh's division B: so, I'll almost always root against them. A: Well, that's true. A: I hate to say it A: but I hate Dallas B: That's okay B: Well I, you know, I, I was never really a big Dallas fan until we moved here A: Yeah. B: and they just kind of grew on me. A: Yeah, A: I imagine. A: That's the way, A: I've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two A: and they, they've actually started doing something. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: So, I've actually paid attention to them. B: Well A: Well, do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in? B: To tell you the truth I haven't paid too much attention to that. A: Really? B: Um, what cities are they looking at? A: Uh, right now I think this Memphis, they're, they're trying to get the teams. B: Uh-huh. A: And that's, that's where I was when I saw, uh, Houston play. B: Uh-huh. A: Saint Louis is trying to get a team. A: Uh, Baltimore is trying to get a team, A: and there's some other city. A: I'm wanting to say Raleigh A: but I'm not sure. B: You know, I think you are right. B: I think it is Raleigh. A: Think so? B: I think I remember hearing that. A: Uh-huh. A: Because I know they've got a football team A: but I think it might be them. B: That would be fun. B: I'd like to see some more teams get in. A: I would, definitely. A: I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after. A: And right now I think Memphis and, it's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it. B: Uh-huh. A: Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis A: and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did. B: Oh, really? A: Yeah. A: It's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two, A: I think that, uh, one, uh, advantage of having, uh, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, uh, convict someone who, uh, really shouldn't be convicted. B: Definitely. A: Um, and I think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps to ensure that. A: I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted. B: Uh-huh. A: Have you ever served on a jury before? B: Uh, I have twice. A: Oh, okay. B: It was a pretty wild experience. A: Uh, what sorts of cases were they? B: They were just, you know, small time cases where, uh, trailers and banks were involved, you know. A: So were they criminal or civil? B: They were civil. B: They weren't they weren't any criminal. A: Oh, okay. A: What, uh, what was the verdict? A: Did the, did the jury have trouble reaching a decision? B: Uh, the jury, it was, uh, let me see, I think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people A: Yeah. B: so it was, B: they, B: and, uh, the one changed his vote at the end. A: So did it become? B: So it became unanimous, you know, after they turned it in A: Yeah. B: and then he changed his mind after they turned it in A: Uh. B: but it then became unanimous. A: Uh. But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, right? A: You just needed a majority? B: Right. A: What was, what was the other case? A: That was also civil? B: The, the other case was just traffic, B: the, B: and, you know, it was seat belt law A: Yeah. B: and it, it didn't even hardly go through, A: Oh, didn't really even count. B: so. A: Yeah. A: I'm, I'm a college student A: so I haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long B: Yeah. A: um, and, uh, I did get one summons actually at one point, A: but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time. B: Yeah. B: Well, you learn a lot going to the juries like that though. A: Yeah, I mean, I, I really, I would like to, uh, to do at some point, um, A: but, I, I haven't. A: Uh, one, one thing that I, I think is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, I, I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now, A: but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well. A: Especially sort of. B: I wouldn't think that it does I mean, from, from my, from what I experienced in them, A: How, B: it didn't, you know, it didn't turn out the way I planned it, I mean, the way that I would think that it would go. A: Uh, you thought it turned out pretty well? B: Yeah, B: but it was, you know, it was, B: jury was unorganized B: and it was, it was just wasn't organized enough for me. A: Yeah. B: I'm not used to it not being organized, B: and I just assumed that it would have been. A: Oh, so it was just kind of a zoo A: and the jurors just sort of, A: someone had to figure out what was going on? B: That's about what it was. A: Um. That's interesting. A: Did it, did it work out pretty well in the end? A: I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, uh, sort of a moderator role in the trial A: or, B: Yeah, B: they, well they picked one person, B: and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have. A: So it it did end up working out pretty well? B: Yeah, B: it ended up working all right. A: The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes B: Yes. A: you know, it's not just a matter of, um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy, A: and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract, A: it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues, A: and I wonder if, uh, if there's really, um, if the system works adequately in, in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion. B: I, I don't think that they, they, they educate them enough to, to really know what's going on. A: In, in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind. A: So. B: Yeah, B: the, the bank was suing them for, uh, because they went to get the, the trailer that, which was, uh, seemingly their property. A: Yeah. A: Uh. B: It was on his property. A: Oh, so the deal was that he had, uh, borrowed money from the bank to buy it, A: and he hadn't made the payments. B: Right. B: So they came to get it. A: Yeah. B: And then when they came to get it, well, it was on the landlord's property B: and he wouldn't let them take it off. A: Uh, so they were suing to get it back. B: So, and they are, it was a double wide, B: so they'd already taken it apart. A: Uh. B: So they left it there A: Yeah. B: and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it. A: Uh. B: So they were suing him for the money, B: and, you know, there's no way they could because it, it was the moving company, A: Uh, I get most of my news uh, from newspapers really. A: I read the daily newspaper, uh, the HOUSTON CHRONICLE A: and sometimes I'll read like the, uh, WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES. A: I don't subscribe to either, A: but sometimes I get a hold of copies of it. A: Uh, how about you? A: Do you, uh, mostly get things from T V or B: Yes. B: I actually get most of my news coverage off uh, computer networks. B: However, I do also watch television news, uh, usually in the morning once a day B: and I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL most every day. A: Oh. A: Oh that's interesting. A: You said computer networks. A: Uh, what, uh, what sort. A: I am fairly knowledgeable of B: Uh well, well DOW JONES for example have the, cause the uh, news wire A: Uh, okay. A: That's interesting. B: and it's picked up and actually available, uh, at my office, B: so, it's, no fee, or subscription either to read at my leisure B: and it's sort of by category. B: For example so I can read a certain business or topics. A: Oh. A: is it, is it the A P news wire A: or is it something that is, uh, a little bit different from that? B: Well, uh, it's similar to that, B: but it's DOW JONES, which is, uh, the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire. A: Uh, okay. A: So, that's that's interesting. A: Okay. A: Yeah, A: I've had, I had access in the past to, uh, uh, the A P news wire A: and I thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news. A: Uh, I've never used the DOW JONES news wire A: but, uh, A: yeah A: it, uh, A: do you get any, uh, do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader, like more long term analytical sort of approach? B: Uh, well actually not. B: Uh, I do, uh, follow, uh, uh, uh, B: I don't know how to how to describe it B: so I'll say a religious newspaper which, which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense. B: It's a weekly but, uh, but not, uh, not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things. A: Yeah B: I'd like to say that however, uh, that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires A: In what way? A: In like, in sort of like, uh, uh, quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like, view point or the way the news is presented or whatever? B: Uh, I think that it, I think that it has to do with, uh, B: I personally think, uh, B: I, I have a problem with their viewpoint B: and I personally think that, uh, that there's a strong there's a strong bias in the media. A: Yeah. A: Well you won't offend me. A: So go ahead and say A: Yeah. A: Like a liberal type of bias. B: Yeah. B: Absolutely. B: Uh, after all, who, who writes. B: People who are journalist who are trained to write B: and they're, that's a liberal, uh, a liberal field at least from academia A: Yeah. B: and, uh, the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in, I find their descriptions to be wrong A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: and it, A: They, they generally make mistake on anything technical at least B: That's right. B: Well, even if it's not technical. If it's, uh, some social thing or whatever. It doesn't matter. B: If I am an expert in it, they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think I'm not expert in it. B: They're telling me lies. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Do you, by mistakes, do you mean just like honest mistakes A: or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things? B: Uh, I think both. B: Uh, by deliberate I, uh, I mean mistake, mistakes of omission or, uh, or, uh, biased toward a particular view point a particular liberal view point that they have. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: So, uh, uh, to give you an example, uh, we will go out of the printing media. B: I know of cases where, uh, we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but, with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you. Which is sort of like a deliberate bias. Which is which is rather disturbing. A: Huh. A: Huh. That's disturbing. B: I mean he does that. A: I haven't really noticed them doing that, A: but whatever, A: again I don't watch T V news that much now. A: If I had access to C N N, I would watch T V news more. A: Uh, I don't you know, but I don't usually. B: Yeah, B: I don't have access either. Although, I did at one time B: and it was, B: I did during the Gulf War B: and it was addictive. A: Yeah. A: Did you, did you think that C N N, well, the Gulf War coverage would be kind of, uh, an abnormality? A: I just I guess. A: I would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say C N N T V news compared to the three networks. A: Uh, you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever A: but I, I guess you wouldn't. A: You probably, A: if you just watched it during the Gulf War, that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much. B: Yeah, B: well during that small sample, I would think that everyone was just about, just about the same, except the three networks, radio television programming. A: Yeah. B: So, if at a particular time, you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by, uh, turning on C N N A: Yeah. B: and you, A: Anyway, uh B: How about you. B: What do you do with your budget? A: What do I do, A: uh, at the moment it's under chaos. A: Uh, right now I'm just, uh, A: I, I don't really have a budget per se. A: I'm, I, uh, it's called living within your means You know, which means at the moment, paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: That's true. A: Uh, but, uh, no A: I don't really have a budget at the moment. A: Uh, but I have uh, I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month A: and then I don't, usually don't exceed that unless I, unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another, like if I have car expenses A: and then that, then it goes through the moon, A: so. B: Yeah, B: that's sort of a problem. A: Yeah, A: so uh, what do B: We're trying, we're trying to, uh, B: so far we are in the clear credit wise B: but, uh, the other side of it is, B: so, not much on that side of it to add to it. B: We're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that B: but, A: So you can afford to get a house? B: Yeah, B: we'd like to do that some day. B: We have this dream. A: Yeah. B: But, we don't know how long it will be a dream. B: We, we're kind of real, we're real happy that we don't have any debt, B: but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this, uh, economy right now B: so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what, the little bit that we do get, you know, on top of expenses every month. A: Yeah. A: So, what do you and your husband do? B: We're missionaries actually. A: Are you really? B: Yeah, B: uh-huh. B: And, uh, it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have, uh, like, uh, uh, support quota A: Um. B: and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here. A: No kidding. B: And it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home. A: I see. B: So, A: Overseas, where would you be going? B: Africa, B: Nigeria. A: Really. B: Yeah. A: Really. A: How long would you be there? B: About four years. B: We're career B: so, we, we go over seas for four years B: and then we come back for a year. B: We go over four, B: we come back for a year. A: With, with what Church? B: Uh, we're with Wycliff Bible Translators. A: Oh yes. A: Yes, B: So. A: I, uh, I know who they are. A: They, uh, they have an office, uh, in in Costa Mesa as I recall. B: Yeah, B: they could very well B: and, A: There, there was, uh, you know, there was a fairly large building that that was well that belongs to them. A: So, uh, are you, uh, are you, uh, active in translation? B: Uh, we will be. B: I was over, over four years doing language surveying which is the first step. B: You're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need. A: Uh-huh B: And, uh, came home and got married B: and we will go back as translators cause we want to raise a family B: and it is easier to raise a family as translators. B: Well, I always wanted to do translation, B: but as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier. B: You know they really need surveyors cause you could, you're free to travel anywhere. B: You don't have kids hanging around you and stuff. A: True, A: true enough. A: So, uh, what, what, uh, what languages do you speak besides English, of course? B: Well, I have a smattering of about ten different ones, B: but there's, B: I'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other, you know, B: since I did you know, complete a survey in one area, I'd switch to the other. A: Uh-huh B: So I know the greetings in about ten, and how to do market stuff, B: but in about, uh, about five I guess, I can do better in it. B: And my French is pretty good B: but it's, uh, French B: so, uh, I'm terrified to speak in, uh in France. A: In France. B: Yeah, B: because they're real snobby about their language B: and French is street French B: and I just picked it up off the street B: and I knew what I was, I knew what I was communicating, B: but I didn't know what I was saying. B: I never sat there and got a direct translation B: and said something here when I came home and French to somebody B: and he paled and said, uh, I'm not going to tell you what you said. B: So, since then I have refrained from speaking any French B: So. B: In A: Uh, B: I don't know what I said to him B: but, uh, I didn't ask him either. A: Must have been terrible. A: The, uh, A: was it Henry Macon said that the, the, uh, language was like a man slowly bleeding to death. A: So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die A: and I, it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that. A: Free style English is just, A: takes on, A: uh, some of my things, A: I, I'd like to have a short work week you know, B: Oh, okay. A: and and we need, you know, better health insurance and you know, B: Okay, B: we can start off there. B: Let's just get started. A: Okay. B: If you don't want to, you know, uh, talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it A: Okay. A: Okay, A: so I just press one then A: right? B: Right. A: Okay, A: ready? B: Yep. A: Okay B: So, so you think, uh, I think that a short work week is real nice. B: Uh, I have a thirty-seven hour work week. B: How about you? A: Well, well right now, I, I'm just a student. A: I only work part time, A: but I've work in the job force before B: Uh-huh. A: and forty hours is just too long. A: You just don't have any time to do anything. A: It seems like, Saturday you get get off, A: but Sunday you're getting ready for Monday. A: And if we get have a if we could have a thirty-two hour work week, with that happen is that, for every four people we could give another job. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: And then that way everybody would have a three day holiday, okay. A: And that way that more, that would make a bigger market. A: We'd have, uh, more recreation. A: People would have time to do it. A: There would be less of a stress level. A: We'd have, we'd have less crime. A: We'd have to we'd have to build less prisons, you know, less police force. B: Yeah, B: it all makes sense to me. B: Although, there may be more crime. I mean if people have more leisure time. B: It's not clear. B: And that, A: It, it, that's, that's a possibility. B: Yeah. A: One, one of the problems they're facing now, a lot of people now, is that the health insurance is that the small business can't, can't offer health insurance B: Uh-huh. A: and it, it's too costly A: and what, what is happening is that they're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it, okay. A: So they get a specific rate. A: Well what happens is that if people start becoming having chronic illness and, and things like that, A: what happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money for one particular, B: Right. A: it's called a a group, A: well what will, well what happens then is that they cancel, because they just can't cancel an individual. A: So they, they have to cancel just like life insurance. A: They have to cancel everything. B: Uh-huh. A: So what they do is that, that they cancel the insurance A: and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage. B: Right. B: So, A: But, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm satisfied with my job. A: I'm, I'm an engineering student. B: Right. A: And I work for my instructor A: and I'm I'm not a typical student. A: I'm, I'm older. A: I'm, I'm in my thirties, okay. B: Yeah. A: And so I have a lot of job experience A: and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants A: and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose B: Yeah. A: but in, in the same token, it's a very, really enjoyable for me because I don't have to have, you know, nobody breathing down my back A: and and one of the things that I, I really hate about jobs. I don't, I don't like bosses that, that you know want to yell at you and you know are down on your back and all this and that. B: Uh-huh. A: I, I just really can't deal with that A: so, B: Yeah A: What kind of, what kind of jobs have you done? B: Well, well, I do uh, research in computer science B: and I've just been doing that for a few years now B: so uh, I, my job has most of the benefits I want. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, what I really like is, I like being, B: like they send me to conferences for instance, but probably not as much as I'd like B: but, uh, you know, that's just nice being, you know, having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of, B: uh, they also, B: a really important thing to me is when they, uh, they pay for continuing education. B: Like, I, I get night courses that they they'll cover right now B: and that's really good A: Yeah, A: that's just great. A: You have what you might call knowledge power B: Right. A: you know, when when you work at a company whether you know it or not, is that you're categorized. A: Some people can be let go and replaced like, uh, say, uh, a typist, uh, somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist. A: But if you're a person who, that's doing computer type things and you have the, you have the knowledge, you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system, well then you're you're vital to the company B: Uh-huh. A: and you get more benefits A: so. That's where I, I, I'm like, A: I'm into computers too A: and that's one of the things that I've found in any one, one of these jobs and anything I've done is that to have knowledge. A: When you have the knowledge, you're you're not going to, uh, you know, be let go, A: be one of the last ones to let go anyway. B: Right. A: So what I, A: Well, what were you saying? B: Okay. B: I, I think we're started now. A: Oh, okay. B: Uh, do you want to go ahead and start? A: Uh, well, I haven't really been up to date on a lot of music. A: I've been in school A: and I haven't really gone out, and bought any or listened to much on the, on the radio except for classical A: and, uh, B: Well, you like classical music? A: Yes. B: Uh, I like classical music. B: I like rock and roll. A: Uh-huh. B: I like country and western A: Okay. B: Uh, I, I like all kinds B: I like, I like different things about each one of them. A: Well, I like most of them except for country music. B: Oh you don't like country? A: No. A: I think I, I might like dancing to it A: but I don't like listening to it. B: The, the kind of country I like is kind of the older country music. Not the, not the kind like Kenny Rodgers and stuff like that. A: Oh. B: That's, uh, that's a little bit to, uh, B: they're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing, B: you know what I mean? A: Uh-huh. A: what's the old country music like? B: Oh, like, like Hank Williams. B: Like the old Hank Williams. B: Even, even Hank Williams, Junior is real good stuff. A: Uh-huh. B: The kind that A: Oh, okay. B: uh, this stuff, makes you cry it sounds so sad B: I mean you A: That's the kind you like you mean? B: Yeah. B: sometimes I do. B: I mean, not all the time. A: Oh. A: Oh, okay. A: Well, I guess I, I like the blues a lot A: and I guess you could say it's similar as far as the kind of the way they do it. B: Yes. B: And I I, I do too. B: I also like jazz. A: Yeah. A: Me too, too. A: I guess I like A: except heavy metal A: and, uh, most rap I don't like. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: You're, you're about like I am B: I, I can't, watch M T V anymore. B: I used to love M T V. A: Oh, okay. B: And I can, I can barely watch anymore because, uh, they have this heavy metal stuff on there B: and, and I can't even, you know, I can't like that. A: Yeah. B: And, and I liked, uh, Aerosmith and Led Zepplin and, uh you know, and, uh, jeez who else is there. Van Halen. A: Uh-huh. A: Okay. A: Okay. A: Yeah. B: Now I like, I like groups like that. B: But when you get, uh, B: I, I even like Guns and Roses, some of their stuff. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, some of these groups now like Slaughter A: Oh, I, I really haven't listened to that B: Some of them are just really rough. B: So, so you went to school then in, B: I'm surprised you didn't go to, to any parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff B: or, A: Well, uh, I used to a long time ago A: but since I've started back into school now, I haven't really done that much. A: I've been pretty busy. Uh B: Okay. A: but, uh, A: so no A: I haven't. A: I, you know, I used to go out and dance a lot A: but I don't do that anymore either A: So. B: Oh, I see. B: Are you married at all? A: No B: Okay A: I've just been real busy with, with lots of other things. B: Well, how old are you? A: Twenty-eight. B: Okay. B: So, you, you were out of you went to school for awhile and quit. Then went back. A: Well, no. A: I, I went to school and got a degree A: and then I worked for awhile. A: And then I just started, I started back a year and a half ago. A: Changed directions. B: Oh, okay. A: Yeah. A: How old are you? B: Oh, I'm, uh, twenty-eight B: I was born in sixty-three B: I guess we're the same age then. A: Oh, okay A: All right. A: Yeah. A: And, uh, I didn't really start getting into music until I went to college because, uh, my parents didn't really have music in the house. A: Put it that way. B: Oh, B: Were they religious? A: Yes. B: uh, I see. B: I, A: So, I'm always behind. A: I'm, I'm not, I'm never really up to date on all that stuff. A: But I know what I like when it's, uh, when I like a sound. A certain kind of sound, A: yeah. B: My parents were very musical. B: My mother had a piano in the, in the house. A: Uh, A: Uh-huh. B: My father likes, uh, country western music. A: Okay. B: He's from, uh, West Virginia. B: So that's what he grew up listening to. A: Uh-huh. B: And he's always liked it B: and, and, you know, he's probably about fifty-three years old now, B: so he grew up like in the late fifties B: and you know, when they had that, the Elvis Presley music and stuff like that. And that kind of rock and roll A: Huh. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: so he likes that. B: And my mom always liked that kind of stuff. B: My mom likes like, uh, Doris Day, you know. A: Oh, really. B: She always had those, these old Doris Day records and stuff like that, though. A: Oh, well. B: So, you know, I grew up listening to that stuff. A: Yeah. B: But, uh, I could see why you went, uh, you know, I could see why you were kind of sheltered I guess from, from music. A: Yeah. A: Well, I, I do play the piano, you know B: Oh, okay. A: But, uh, I, I like the, uh, early seventies, late sixties rock. Kind of stuff, the old stuff. B: Oh, okay. A: And, uh, B: Yeah, B: so do I. A: Uh, B: Do you like, uh, like Van Halen or anything like that? B: Or how about Brian Adams? A: what kind of music is, does what songs does he play? B: It, it, B: THIS LOVE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE. Uh, SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE. A: Uh-huh. A: I think I've heard SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE. B: Yeah. B: He sings that. A: Yeah. B: He's, he's from Canada. A: Okay. A: I'm not, I'm not very good at remembering the, uh titles, B: The titles and artists. A: yeah, A: but I can remember this, the song. A: Yeah. B: Well, do do you watch music television, M T V at all? Or V H One? A: Yeah A: No, A: I don't watch T V much at all. B: Okay. A: So. B: do, do you get cable? A: No. B: Oh, B: okay. B: That's, that's A: No. B: you have to get cable to get those stations anyhow. A: Yeah. A: So. B: But, uh, yeah. B: I like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos. A: Uh-huh. B: I like watching that kind of thing. B: It's, A: Do you like, uh, like someone recent? Like Enya? A: Have you ever head of her. A: She's not rock A: but she, she's from Ireland. B: No, B: I haven't heard her. B: Oh, okay. A: And, uh, she's gotten some, uh, she's been on like the top ten, I guess, or whatever. B: Oh, really. A: She, she did A: Okay. B: So how serious is the, subject of crime in your area? A: Well, needless to say, here in Washington, D C this is the war zone. A: Uh, D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital. A: It's, uh, it's really bad here. A: Uh, for example, the, uh, local high school, uh, they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns B: Jeez. A: and they're starting to, uh, get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school, of all things. A: So, B: Well, luckily, it hasn't gotten that bad here. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, but it's on the uprise, especially in a lot of the, uh, outlying agricultural towns. Uh, because you end up having a lot of gangs forming, uh, largely around the Hispanic core. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, it seems to be that, uh, gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions. A: Uh-huh, A: right. A: That's how they, uh, they bind themselves together in groups, I guess A: and, uh, B: Yeah. A: Now, the, A: interestingly enough, I don't think we have here, a, a lot of gangs, but, uh, only a couple, uh of, not a whole large group of them, but, uh, just a few. Most of them centered around, uh, drug territory. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And so they're protecting their economic interests, I guess. B: Yeah A: And, uh, nowadays the latest thing I've, I've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as, uh, crimes involving stealing cars is that, instead of stealing, uh, cars like at night, breaking into them or whatever, they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up, A: and then as you get out of the car, they just, uh, step up and, uh, take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house. B: Well, that's efficient. A: Yeah, A: that's the, uh, latest thing. A: That way there's no damage to the car or anything. A: They just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want. B: They're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. A: Just wait for you to drive to your house, A: you get out A: and they get in A: off they go with your car. B: Wow. A: So it's, A: uh, I think they call it car jacking around here B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: I'd heard that phrase. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah, A: that's kind of the latest thing, A: but every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides, A: so it's, uh, it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here, A: we're from, uh, I'm from Ohio A: and my wife's from Florida A: so, B: Uh-huh. A: And we've just come from twenty years in the military and, uh, which is an entirely different environment, A: so this is a whole new thing for for us to, to have to put up with A: and it's, uh, really scary sometimes. B: Yeah, B: there aren't that many, places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays. A: Right. A: And it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, of course, the mayor, uh, of D C is having a real problem, uh, trying to, A: what do you do to, to reduce crime in a, in a major city like D C where it's a way of life for everybody. A: It's, uh, I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem. A: I don't know what, what the solution is. A: Uh, there's no way they can stop the drugs, A: and that's what's causing all the killing. B: Well, uh, there's a couple of things that I've heard, B: uh, most of them are fairly, uh, radical in terms of what you'd have to do. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, course the, the reason that, that these kids tend to, to turn toward the drugs and everything else seems to be just, you know, the, the, the end results of, of poverty and, and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else A: Uh-huh. B: because, I mean, you know, the parents aren't making a living at anything. A: Right B: Uh, A: And they see all their friends and neighbors, uh, B: And they're accidental parents half the time anyway. A: Yeah, A: and their friends are driving Mercedes A: and, so it's actually, A: they grow up with that as their way of life A: and, uh, I think, uh, to a large extent, they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised. B: It's illegal, B: but it's not wrong because all their friends do it. A: Right A: exactly, A: so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes A: and they they say, well, it's, it's the law that's, uh, got to be changed instead of their way of life, B: Yeah. A: so, I don't know, A: it's A: I'm glad it's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy. B: Well I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of, of an actual solution to the problem. Uh A: Uh-huh. B: the, the social, the other social problems wouldn't, wouldn't go away. A: Right. B: Uh, A: They've always been with us. B: I mean, there's, there's been a lot of, uh, B: and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus, B: but then, the more I thought about it, the more sense it made, is that, uh, alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow, A: Right. A: Okay, A: looks like we're ready to go. A: Capital punishment, uh, A: the problem I have with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime, A: but I don't think that it really actually does that. A: I don't think it deters anybody, because most of the time crimes are, uh, are committed with a, without any thought to the consequences A: and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe I shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, I might get the gas chamber or something like that. A: They worry about it afterwards A: and then they try and get out of it. A: And, uh, how about you B: Well, I think that in some cases, it is warranted. A: Uh-huh, A: I do, too, A: yep. B: And I don't, B: I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah, A: you still have to do it. A: I, I, B: I mean I mean, I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer A: Uh-huh. B: or, A: So you're in, you're in favor of capital punishment, then. B: Well, for some things. A: Right. B: I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Needs to be punished or, uh, eliminated from society. B: I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. A: Right. A: And then do it all over again. A: Uh-huh. B: And I don't think that, that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. A: Have to agree with you, A: and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. A: I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes, A: but, I tend to agree with you that, uh, we should have it A: I just, I don't know that it's always effective A: but I guess we, uh, we're kind of stuck with it. A: It's, it's a difficult, uh, problem, isn't it, to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime, uh, B: But, then, you know, I think that, that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. You know, just, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Right, A: uh-huh. B: and I don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment. A: Uh-huh, A: huh. Do you think they should be punished at all, or, uh, like go to prison, uh, A: because they're not really a danger to society. A: It was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that. B: Uh it is to a certain extent A: Uh-huh. B: but I think, B: I don't know because, A: I know they put, uh, put them in jail sometimes, I guess. Uh, B: I think in B: and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and, and the extent of the abuse and, and if another alternative was available. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Um. A: Uh-huh. A: You know, now, I wonder what you think about this A: and, uh, unfortunately, we, we don't get to do it, A: but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. A: So if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to, uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. A: And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to, to get revenge on them A: and, uh, but, I, I don't think that's done much anywhere A: That's kind of drastic punishment. B: Well, I think that would be kind of drastic punishment. A: Right. B: And, A: Might make you feel better A: but B: But, one thing, I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: But, like I said, if, if someone is, is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. A: Uh-huh. A: Right, A: because they're a danger to everybody else. A: Huh, that's interesting. A: I have to, uh agree with that. B: But, A: There's a lot of folks, probably, that are in prison that, uh, that aren't really a danger to society, huh, A: and, uh, B: And a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison. A: Right. A: Right, A: probably more of them then the other way around A: Interesting. A: I don't, I don't, not sure A: I, I'm in Washington, D C or at least very close to it. A: I'm not sure what kind of, uh, capital punishment we have here. B: Well, I know in North Carolina, we do have capital punishment. A: Uh-huh. B: And I'm I'm from South Carolina. A: Well, we, in, in, in our family, have been pretty remiss in trying to, uh, you know, keep track of, uh, daily finances. A: Uh, the, uh, way back, what, twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer, I did what everybody else does, which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks, and, you know, checkbooks and all this kind of thing A: and we kept that going for about a month A: and it became so onerous that we gave up on it B: Uh-huh. B: That sounds about right A: You know, so, uh, the only thing we're, you know, that we do now is, uh, I keep a, a little spread sheet of, uh, what I call the net worth calculation which is just the, the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth. A: Uh, and I only update that, oh I don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. Every three months. Just, basically when the statements come in. You know. Just to see whether or not we're falling, you know, getting ahead, falling behind or staying even or what. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: Uh, that's really about, you know, the extent of, uh, of the kind of, uh, financial score keeping that we're doing. B: Uh B: Well it's kind of difficult for me. Because right now, uh, like most teachers, I'm laid off B: and A: Huh. A: Oh dear, that's terrible. B: so, um, I spend most, you know, B: I substitute a lot. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's a lot, it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not, to try to keep track of finances. A: Uh-huh. B: And, but I know how much I have to bring in a month B: And that's about it. B: That's about as far as we go. B: And then anything extra is, you know, more or less split up between all of us. And just thrown in the kitty, more or less, for a rainy day A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, I see. A: Are you, are you married? A: Are you living with a bunch of, with, with people that you're sharing expenses? B: Uh, no. B: I'm a single mother. B: I have three children. A: Oh, I see, A: uh-huh. B: So, uh, right now, we're on, we get you know, aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it. B: And my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support A: Oh dear. B: So right now I know what I'm getting from the state B: and, uh, I have to balance, more or less, what I get from the state with my bills and, uh, you know, try to work as many days as possible. Any time they call me in. A: Uh-huh. B: But I still have to figure out. B: If I work too many days, then I lose all my state aid B: and if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills B: and it's like a juggling act every single month. A: Uh-huh. B: Like this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in B: but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation. A: I see. B: So, you know, the four days before, they only have a four day week A: Uh-huh. B: and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in A: oh, I see. B: They don't like to be absent before a vacation. A: Oh, sure. B: But we're shopping around as far as, well I'm shopping around as far as trying to get, uh, that's why I'm doing this, to get some extra money. And, uh, getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts. A: Uh-huh. B: My kids are in Boy Scouts B: so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts B: because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me. B: So it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit. B: But, you know, we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul. B: I guess we're in the situation that a lot of middle-class Americans are in. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: you're the first, you know, uh, A: my next door neighbor just lost his job. In a, you know, one of these, uh, B: Oh, my Lord. A: his company went broke. I mean went, you know, bankrupt. A: Actually, it was a subsidiary of a, of an outfit called U S Shoe or something. A: it was a computer subsidiary. A: I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company. B: Really. A: But, uh, you know, they just folded it up and, uh, uh, told him to, A: they took the top management and gave them jobs with the, with the corporate, uh, at the corporate front office B: Uh-huh. A: and everybody else was sent packing. B: Oh A: Uh, hang on one second A: I've got B: Sure. A: uh, somebody was knocking on my door here. A: Uh, it sounds like, in a certain sense, at least at the present, A: I mean, it sounds, sounds terrible to say, A: but at the present stage, you probably are even more in the market for a, a budgetary thing than, than most people probably might be. In terms of keeping, keeping score of input and output. B: Right. B: Uh-huh. B: Definitely. A: Do you have, do you have a computer at home A: or, B: Uh, yes B: we do. B: And we try to, A: Uh-huh. B: you know, I keep track of every penny. And, more or less, enter it in. A: Uh-huh. B: Every single day I'm at the computer. A: I see. B: And, it's like, okay, what do we have left, what do we have to pay, what have we paid this month. What hasn't come in yet, you know A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Have you, do you use a standard, uh, a standard spread sheet A: or I mean, A: Okay, A: this topic is, is Russia a threat to our security? A: I think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time. A: how do you feel about it? B: Well, they do have, uh, a major internal problem B: Everybody wants to defect, B: and I can understand why. B: Um, I think their biggest problem is just, you know, obtaining food to live, B: so when you have the basic needs, uh, being unmet I don't think you think globally as far as, you know, being a threat to other people in the world. B: So, as soon as they get their, their own home country taken care of, then they'll consider, what they can do with the keeping those full A: so they've dropped the, uh, A: they're not nearly as selective as they used to be. B: Yeah. A: And, course, that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex. A: You start letting that happen and they go down A: and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things A: so, uh, I'm sure that aggravates it also. B: Yeah. A: But, unemployment now in Dallas, or in Texas is up around six point, A: I guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling. B: Yes. A: Well, lots, right? B: Right A: Finally. B: Really, B: what, what do you do, now? A: Well, we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the, uh, Boy Scouts our boys have been involved in have, uh, had a huge recycling bin, over at Resurrection Lutheran Church B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, so we've done that for quite some time, A: but since the price of paper has gone down A: like it's about a fifth of what it used to be B: Oh, really? A: so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the City took it over. B: Okay. A: So now we just put ours out for the City of Plano. A: Do you live in Plano? B: Yes, B: I do. A: Okay, A: yeah. B: Yeah, B: and I'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins. A: Right. B: Have you had yours now? A: Yes. B: Yeah. A: Although just, just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that, uh, work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs. B: Oh, that's why I asked you. A: Yeah. B: and not everyone got theirs right away. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: And I, I was so relieved because I've been making a real concerted effort, make, you know, recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it. A: Uh-huh. A: Right, A: yeah, A: we used to take ours there. B: And, uh B: my garage was just getting overwhelmed. A: I know. B: And, of course, I didn't go weekly, B: so it became quite a big thing, A: Right. B: and, uh, A: Right, A: I'm really glad they do it. A: Uh, yeah, A: I do news, mostly newspapers and, uh, plastic two liter diet Coke bottles And aluminum cans some, B: Yes, B: yeah. A: but I don't use as many of those. B: Uh-huh. A: I guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really, that are really dirty that you have to wash out B: Yeah, B: well, I found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two. A: Uh, ha. B: Uh, ha, A: Wasting all your time and effort and, Putting it in there. B: Thinking I was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: But, uh, you know, but it, it's not that hard now that I've got this system under control. A: Got your routine down. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: Well, I guess there are some places, uh, in the north, in particular that, uh, have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle A: because they charge you, let's see, they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight. B: Uh, uh-huh. A: So if you recycle things, of course, then you don't have all that weight in there. B: Yeah, B: I do find that I don't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are, are being tossed in with the recycling. A: Right. A: That's right. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, I don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than, uh, B: what are some of the things they don't recycle. B: Oh, one thing I thought about the other day were batteries, B: just everyday regular batteries. Supposedly, you know, leak and, and contaminate the landfills A: Um. A: Right. B: and, yet, what am I going to do when I have a couple double A batteries to toss out. A: Yeah, A: right. B: And they don't take, A: Probably going to throw them in your trash B: Yeah, B: that's what happens B: because, A: Well, there are places that take car batteries, A: but I wonder if they would take, B: Yeah. A: I mean, not that it would A: kind of a pain to, you know, drive over somewhere special just for that, for two little tiny batteries A: but, B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: but I think the city one could possibly look into that or something. A: Yeah, A: that's true. B: Uh, if they've got these bins for all the other little items, B: I'm sure if people will have batteries, uh, you know, quite often to, to toss out. A: Right, A: that's true. A: Uh, when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the, uh, the truck came by, well, we all ran out to watch it because, you know, we'd never really seen it pick up our stuff B: Uh-huh. A: and one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he, uh, scanned across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff B: Oh. B: Oh, is that right? A: and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just, you know, scanned it, A: so I don't know why, what that was reading it for B: Huh. A: but, uh B: Registering our garbage A: they must be trying to keep track of , you know, who is doing it, or what, I guess. B: Yeah. A: I don't know. A: Another, B: Wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year A: Ooh, for those who are really cooperating. B: Yeah. A: Now, that would encourage it. B: Well, except I know it would just not be cost effective. B: They've already got all this money out on hiring, uh, getting the trucks and hiring people to work them. B: I'm sure they couldn't afford that. A: Sure. B: But A: Sure. B: uh, A: But the garbage, uh, A: now there is just one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of two. B: Yeah. B: Oh, yeah. A: So that's interesting. A: Uh, also, slightly off the subject, but our, our big green garbage thing got stolen. B: Oh, it did? A: Uh-huh. B: Gosh. A: And we we called the City A: and, uh, they, they brought us a new one A: and they did not charge us. A: And they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen. B: Oh, my goodness. A: Isn't that sad? You know. B: It is sad. A: And just, B: You know, B: they paid for those things anyway. A: Oh, and they must be, Yeah, really expensive. B: Or, our taxes do. A: I mean, of course, we were hoping we weren't, we weren't going to have to pay for it, you know B: Uh-huh. A: but, I mean, what would somebody do with them. A: Arlington, Texas A: now since I got somebody from Arlington, Virginia one day B: Is that right? A: Yeah. B: Well, I never thought about that, B: but there is an Arlington, B: like I had a call the other day from Birmingham, Michigan you know, A: Oh B: and I was thinking yeah, and I was thinking A: Birmingham. B: the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama. A: Right. A: It's funny how many names have been used, uh, all over the country. B: Yeah, B: well, tell me what kind of books have you read? A: Well, to tell you the truth, I've been going to college for the last four years A: so mainly, text books. B: I was going to say, not fun kind, right? A: No, um, A: but, I, I really tend to like biographies a lot, not necessarily always heavy ones B: Uh-huh. A: but, you know, sometimes A: I just read one about Grace Kelley. A: I love to read about real people. A: To me, half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories B: Yeah, B: it is, B: because you know that's it's really and truly a true thing. A: Yeah, A: it happened. B: You know, I read one about Bob Hope that I liked. A: Really? B: Yeah, B: that was real good. B: I'm like you, B: if it's not a heavy biography, you know I enjoy it. A: Right. A: I used to like to read about royalty a lot. A: I, when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived, I think, in Europe. A: That was my thing for a while. B: I was trying to think, uh, B: I read a, uh, a novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all, B: and there was a murder. A: Oh, really. B: Yeah, B: it was some time ago. B: Seems like it was THE SPY WENT DANCING, or something like that. A: Oh, it sounds like fun. B: It was a lot of fun because they used these real names, you know. A: Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers, you know A: Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those. B: Yeah, B: in fact I believe it was B: because, A: Really? B: Uh-huh. B: I believe. A: Sounds like something she would write. B: Yeah, B: I think it was by her, now that you mention it, because someone had given it to me, B: and I thought, well, this will be great, B: and it was. A: Yeah, A: I've heard that she's done you know, her books are really interesting, A: and they always sell well. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, B: Well, when you use real people like that, I think royalty, especially, you know. A: Yeah, A: brings it to life. A: I know, uh, the some of the British people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty. B: Yeah, B: but you know, that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth, you know. A: I know, A: our movie stars. B: Our movie stars, B: because it's totally different concept to us. A: Oh, right. B: I haven't, I haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either. B: I have read, uh, mostly novels. B: I went to visit my daughter in Florida A: Um. B: and I took a novel with me, uh, and read it at Thanksgiving time, B: and, uh, it was, uh, one of those generation novels, you know A: Oh, yes. B: starts out when they're small and continues through generations A: Oh, I always like those. B: and I like that. A: Have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch? B: Yes, B: I have. A: Isn't she fabulous? B: Oh, she is wonderful. A: Oh, once you A: I don't like to get one of her books A: because, I, I just live to read. A: I'll, I'll skip everything just to get back to the book B: I stayed up one night, I think until two in the morning finishing one of hers because I I could not put it down. A: Oh, yeah. A: She's just a, A: I don't know, A: does she, how often does she come out with them. A: I probably have missed the last few since I've been back in school. B: Well, no, B: it seems like she doesn't write as often as, oh, well, like Danielle Steele and those silly things. B: She writes the same thing. A: Well, she can, she can turn them out overnight, I swear. B: Yeah, B: and, and they're the same silly things, B: I mean, if you've read one, I mean it's, It, it's practically the same thing over and over, you know. A: Yeah, A: I've never read a whole one of hers, I don't think. A: And think how rich she is. B: Yeah, B: wouldn't I, you know, B: I'm criticizing her, B: and wouldn't I like to have her money A: Oh, yeah. B: because they go from hardback to paperback B: and she has millions of them. A: And then make movies out of some of them. B: Uh-huh. B: You know, mini series and so forth, B: and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often. B: I have not seen as many of hers. A: Well, hers are so involved, A: and they're so such a higher intellectual level, because she quotes a lot, you know. B: Uh-huh. B: I think she does a lot of research, too. A: I do too, A: so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers, B: Huh-uh. A: but oh, her books are just incredible. A: I don't think they've ever made a movie, do you? B: No, B: I don't think so, B: and I've often wondered why, haven't you? A: Yes B: You know, I, A: well, no, uh, A: I really just thought about it now A: but there's just, B: Yeah. A: Maybe it's because they take so much in. A: I don't know. B: Uh-huh. B: Maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them, you know. A: They're so big B: Uh-huh. A: they're such, you know, A: it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND, I guess another three hour movie B: Yeah. B: And maybe that turns people off, B: but look at GONE WITH THE WIND, you know. A: Oh, I know. A: It's about one of my favorite movies. B: Uh, have you, uh, gotten into SCARLETT yet? A: No, A: it had such a bad press, A: I wasn't too . B: Yeah, B: that's exactly what I was going to say. B: I was amazed, B: because I, B: in the beginning when it was on, you know, on route coming out I heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad, A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: and then when it came out, all I heard was just, oh, how bad it was, that I didn't even want to get it. A: Me, either. A: Do you know anyone that's read it? B: Huh-uh. A: No, A: I haven't heard of anybody that's read it, either. B: No. A: I think it was on the best-seller list, though for a while. B: Well it wouldn't surprise me, A: Are you there? B: Uh-huh. A: Okay, A: now tell me your favorite team. B: Uh, baseball? A: Yes. B: Well, I've been kind of been intrigued with the Rangers, uh, more so with, uh, uh, their management than anything else. B: I, I don't follow baseball that, that closely, B: but, uh, you know, since I live here so close to Arlington, uh, that's the team that I've been kind of following. A: Okay. A: I think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us A: where do you think they're headed, A: so we'll have to talk about the future with the Rangers. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: What are your thinkings on what they can do, what they'll be able to do? B: Well, I think that, uh, you know, with, uh, so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money, it's, um, you know, I think B: I'm not real sure about B: do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's, uh, A: Well, I heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down. on his, B: Yeah B: that, he was willing to come down a little bit and, A: Yes. A: And the Rangers go up a little bit, A: uh-huh. B: but a little bit from three, you know, from thirty million dollars or thirty-five B: that's a lot of money. A: I think the entire baseball, A: yeah, A: they're the ones that probably are paying the highest. B: Yeah, B: they are. A: And I think this is absolutely ridiculous. B: Uh-huh. A: No. B: And I really think, I really think that, uh, that they ought to, B: I'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money. B: I think they should, uh, uh, pay him what his salary is going to be, uh, and let him, B: because he's got one more year before he turns into a free agent. A: That's right. B: And then, uh, who knows, B: if he produces next year, they may have to end up paying him anyway, B: but if he doesn't, then his market value will go down B: and they can pick him up for, for a lot less than, than they would, uh, if they paid him the you know, the six million dollars a year this year. A: . A: What I saw on the news today, that A: Buechele was back just to visit. B: Uh-huh. A: I'm awful sorry he's not still. B: Oh, yeah, B: but you know, what, he, B: that was a great deal for him. A: Oh, I'm sure it was. B: Yeah, B: it was a great deal for him B: and, and, uh, he just signed on, uh, B: I think it was like a five year deal with, uh Pittsburgh. A: Pittsburgh. A: Yeah. B: So, you know, he's real happy there. B: As far as the Rangers are concerned, I think, I think they need some, definitely need some pitching. A: Yes, sir. B: Uh, and so I, you know I, A: Well, what do you think of Howse, who is the coach for the pitchers? B: The pitching coach? A: Yes. B: Well, you know, I was just looking at the news tonight, B: and they showed a, a, a black guy that was was helping out, uh, His assistant. A: His assistant. A: Uh-huh. B: And I think that's a, a great addition. B: I mean, he seemed to know what he was doing B: and, and, uh, A: I really wish they could see fit to get rid of Howse. B: Oh, you don't like Howse, huh? A: No, A: no, A: I really don't. A: And I'm not going to stand up, you know on my, soapbox and say that, A: but I'm, not fond of Howse A: and I'm not fond of Grieves. B: Oh, Tom Grieve? A: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: I'm, I'm not sure that, um, that they're ready to get rid of, of, uh, Tom Grieve yet, B: but Howse might be a different, uh, situation, B: and I think you're probably right, that they, that they need some, you know, some changes in, uh, pitching coach, maybe B: and, um, A: Well, I'm just gullible enough that I think Bobby Valentine is, um, uh, doing all right A: and I'm sure, B: You do, huh? A: Well B: That's contrary to, uh, popular belief, you know A: Oh, I know, A: I know so, A: but I would like so much for these Rangers to get their act together and give, um, oh, uh, Nolan Ryan the support he needs. B: Oh, I know B: You know, it's too bad that, uh, it has to be a forty-two year old guy to, to lead the, uh, the Rangers, you know. A: I understand. B: They need to have some, some young guys that can take the lead B: and, and, B: uh, Yeah. A: Well, I just oh, I have so many mixed emotions about all this. A: But I think with their new stadium, they should go and let, A: Okay. B: Well, if you're from Iowa, you must be very artsy crafty. B: Everyone I've ever known from the Midwest can do everything with their hands. A: Oh, well, actually I'm from California A: and before then I was from Utah. A: So. B: I didn't know anyone ever moved from California to Iowa? A: Well, I grew up in California, A: and then I went to school in Utah, A: and I got married there A: and we stayed there for a while, A: and then, now we're in Iowa B: I'm teasing, only because I'm from Indiana. A: Oh, really. B: I really like, I like the Midwest. A: Oh. B: But I married a Texan, B: and they have a way of dragging you back home. B: Anyway, we're supposed to be talking about crafts. B: Do you, um, do you have any hobbies that, that you do things with your hands like knitting or, A: Um. A: Well, I crochet, A: and I do water color, A: and I, um, sew A: and I do fabric painting. B: Oh, you do a lot then. B: Do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching? A: Um, I've done some cross stitching. A: I haven't tried any needlepoint yet. A: How about you? B: Um, actually I, I'm pretty untalented A: Oh, right. B: I used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting, um, B: but I, I don't know, B: somehow I don't have the time anymore. B: But I have all these friends that wherever you go, they, they sit down and the next thing you know, they pull out of their, uh, bags some, their most recent, uh, needle craft A: Oh, really. B: and in December everyone was doing stockings, you know these gorgeous, detailed minute, tiny stitch stockings. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, gosh. A: Oh, yeah, A: well those take a lot of time. B: Yes. A: I only can do things that are pretty fast, because we just, um, got our baby last year, A: and I just don't have the patience to just, you know, do something. B: Is this your first baby? A: Uh-huh. B: Have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets? A: Um, I crocheted an afghan for our bed. A: That's the only thing, A: and, and I did a quilt, A: let's see, I've done a quilt for our baby A: and I've done a quilt for our bed, A: but I mean, B: Did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself, B: or how did you make a quilt? A: Um. A: Um, our baby's quilt, it was a pre, like the design, A: I just went around the design in the quilt. B: Uh-huh. A: I didn't piece it or anything like that A: but, uh, B: But you actually hand quilted it yourself? A: Uh-huh, A: and, B: Did, did you need a loom, B: or were you B: was it small enough that you could just hold it? A: Um, I put it on the frame, the quilting frame. A: Have you, are you familiar with that? B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: okay B: But, um, my, again, my mother back in Indiana, B: we had a quilting frame in our basement, B: and she would, she would quilt whole quilts by herself. A: Oh, my God. B: Um, yes, B: which, B: I was always amazed. B: I have one of them. Um, B: but, uh, you know, to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that, it's a tremendous amount of work. A: Well, I haven't done tons of them A: But, um, I used to do more before, um, before I had, before we got our baby, A: but. B: Oh, you think, children, B: you can, um, use crafts to make wonderful things for children. A: Uh-huh. B: I think when babies, B: I think afghans and, and the crocheted little sweaters, and, are, are wonderful. B: And, and they'll wear them A: Yes, A: exactly. B: Once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear them A: Well, one thing that I like about this fabric painting thing is I can just make a T shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then, um, cut out a little pattern from the material, from some material, like flowers or something, and make, um, a design or, you know, a little arrangement or something on the shirt and, you know, fuse it on with Heat and Bond, or whatever and then paint around it. A: And I usually sew, sew around the flower, whatever first, A: and then I paint around it A: so you can't see the stitching as much. A: Does, does that make sense to you? A: So. B: Oh, yes, B: I think it's very clever. B: It's, uh, funny that you said. B: For Christmas, my daughter and I received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for us. A beautiful Christmas design, A: Oh. B: and they were matching B: and they were lovely, B: but when I washed them, although I took the precaution of turning them inside out I really didn't do anything else. And truly, everything fell off, or most of it. A: Oh, sure. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, really. B: So I had, I went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back B: and I bought the paint and redid most of the edges A: Oh. B: and, and it was salvageable B: and I, B: but it's, B: so I'm familiar with that, B: but I think you're very clever to, um, sew around the edges. B: I think gluing alone, certainly if you wash it any amount of time, it tends to kind of come loose at the edges. A: Well. A: Yeah, A: someone told me that, that it, that they had done it both ways, A: and I've always, after hearing that, I always sewed it on, even, even with the, uh, a loose zigzag even helps A: And, um, A: Okay. A: So how do you just figure , B: Well, you know, it depends upon our weather here. You know, B: today was a beautiful day B: it was like, uh, uh, summer day. B: It was seventy degrees B: so so I dressed in, uh, uh, a light weight skirt, A: Wow. B: it's a, uh, ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater, cardigan over it. A: Uh-huh. B: Because I had some appointments at the office today, some interviews B: and so I had to dress up anyway B: and then I wore heels, you know. A: Uh-huh. B: But when it rains a lot, which is has been doing here a lot lately, uh, very often, you know, wear, uh, pants and boots you know. A: Oh. B: So how do you dress? A: Well, um, I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I was working at now. B: Okay. A: Um, when I was a teacher, um, in Utah, I would generally wear, um, dresses and heels and things like that, B: Uh-huh. A: and even when it, um, rained and snowed I just braved it A: and I wore heels anyway B: Yeah. A: And, B: I, I can see, B: I, I've been a teacher so has my daughter B: and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that, it was tiring. A: I know, A: it might kill you to go up and walk up to the door B: That's right. A: but you're going to look nice for the kids B: That's right B: and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids, right? A: Oh, oh, yeah. A: Well, I need all the height I can get B: Yeah, B: I do too. B: So to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades, uh, older grades, I had to wear heels. A: Oh, yeah. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: we too. Um, A: if it was it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots A: but then I would change, um, into heels, as soon as I got to my desk. B: Uh-huh. A: So, um, B: Of course, we wear, uh, an unlined boots, you know, B: it has a heel on it. B: They're the kind of boots that I wear to work B: and we wear them, you know, B: they're a leather boot that you wear B: and as I said they have a regular heel on them, high heel. A: Oh. B: And they wear them, we wear them a lot with shirts and things. B: Uh, it's kind of a, B: I can't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots. B: They're not a cowboy boot, B: but they're just a real pretty boot, B: but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain. A: Oh. B: As I have a private high school that I run here and so when I'm interviewing a parent, of course I feel like I need to wear heels you know, and look like I'm a business person. You know, because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle, if you wear boots too often, you know. A: Sure. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Huh. Well, um, B: Of course, you probably wear coats a lot. A: Yeah, um, A: the first two years I was in a room where they didn't heat it A: So I did, B: Oh, my goodness B: so then you had to. A: Yeah, A: and then the third year we, um, got heating A: so it was nice B: Yes. B: Then things improved, right? A: Right, A: uh-huh. B: But of course, here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know, you know, A: Oh, that's nice. B: and, uh, that's very seldom B: we, it depends upon our winter. B: We have a few days you might wear a coat, winter coat, you know, B: but most of the time you can wear a sweater B: and we just don't wear coats much. B: We often laugh about even when it turns chilly. B: We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh. Nice. A: Well B: It's really different. B: Let's put it that way. B: Are you not teaching anymore? A: Uh, no, A: we, we moved to Iowa A: and, um, I'm working at a day care right now. B: I see. A: And so the way I dress is really different because I'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months. B: Oh, so you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet. A: Yeah, A: I wear, uh, tennis shoes, and jeans and things that, you know, are sort of, um, B: Yeah, B: uh-huh. B: More practical. A: not, A: yes, A: it doesn't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something. B: When you were teaching, did you ever have, uh, uh, a blue jean day or anything like that? A: Yeah, A: but I never wore jeans because, um, I thought that was too casual B: Yeah, well, A: For, B: I know that some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day, B: and I always thought it was kind of out of, got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too. A: Yeah, A: really. B: It's all right for the students, B: they look tacky a lot B: but I didn't think teachers should, you know. A: Yeah, A: that's how I feel too. B: Yeah. B: Do you like, uh, uh, Iowa? A: Um, oh, it, there's some good things about it A: but I've seen. A lot of things I'm not used to yet, um, B: Where did you live before? A: Um, we lived in Utah before A: and, and I grew up in California. B: Oh, well, that's quite a change from California to Utah, A: Well, uh, what is your favorite kind of music? B: Well, I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be, uh, classical music. A: Oh, same here. B: Oh, really. A: Yeah. B: What type of music do you like in the classical area, B: or what era do you, era do you like the most? A: Oh, well, I guess I like a wide range. Uh, everything from, uh, from Baroque through at least some modern music. B: Uh-huh. A: And my wife and I these days are especially into opera. A: We've been sort of opera fans for a few years now. B: Um, do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages? A: Well, we, uh, generally, A: the places we've gone they sing in the original languages. B: Uh-huh. A: Like the Dallas opera here normally does, I guess. B: Uh-huh. B: I, I haven't gotten into that too much because, I, uh, if I don't know the story line and, um, I don't speak the language, then I have difficult time, comprehending what's going on. A: Well, one thing that's helped us a lot is that, uh, you, you know, you can buy a lot of these operas now on video uh, video tape B: Uh-huh. A: and so we have quite a collection of those, A: and you watch them at home, A: and they have subtitles, A: so you, you figure out what's going on after a while, A: and then you can enjoy it in the, uh, theater. B: Oh. A: But, you know, the, uh, Dallas opera now has, uh, super titles on, on all their performances I think. B: What is that? A: Well, they, they give an, uh, an English translation on a, on a screen up above the stage. B: Oh, I didn't know that. A: Yeah. B: That can help people like me. A: In fact, they even do that for operas sung, sung in English, because it is hard to understand the words sometimes. B: Well, I can understand that. B: So, I'd say, Vivaldi is probably my favorite, uh, composer. A: Yeah, A: well, I really like Vivaldi. A: Uh, he's, uh, definitely one of the, one of the top of that era. B: Yeah. B: I like Baroque music, B: I like full body music, uh, with the, um, um, with brass and winds, woodwinds, instruments, you know. A: Uh-huh. B: Course I like, uh, also string instruments, B: and I have two string instruments in my house. Uh, instrument players, B: both my sons play string instruments. B: One plays the cello B: and the other one plays the viola. A: Oh B: So, I get to go to at least four or five concerts a year A: Uh-huh. A: How, how old are they? B: One is thirteen and one is eleven. A: So they're doing this in school, or what? B: Yes. A: Uh-huh. B: Yes . A: Well, you've got half a string quartet there. B: Yeah. B: We're on our way. A: Yeah. B: So, uh, um, I try to enjoy all of it. A: Well, since you seem to like, uh, Italian music, have you ever, uh, gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era, the, uh, period right before, actually before Vivaldi, I guess? B: Um, a little bit, B: but, um, a lot of the, um, music I don't know about, uh, as far as the titles, B: and I have to listen to it, and and figure out, what I'm listening to. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, I do belong to a Musical Heritage Society. A: Oh, yes, A: uh-huh. B: Do you belong to that? A: No, A: I don't, A: but I think I know what it is. A: Isn't that a, uh, uh, see, A: can't you get records through that or something, recordings? B: You can get recordings. B: Uh, they know have them on compact disc or or, uh, or cassettes or L P A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, they do their, they do a lot of original recordings themselves. A: Yes, A: yeah, A: I think, uh. B: But they also, uh, they also, uh, go to the different composers, or the different, I guess, B: what do you call them the guys that orchestrate the the conductors. A: Uh. A: Uh, yes, A: right B: Yeah. B: They go to conductors, uh, B: and, and they actually have them perform the music, B: and they record it. A: So, they're actually commissioned performances. B: Sure. B: A lot of them are. A: Uh-huh. B: Or they will find out when they're performing, B: and they will, uh, record the music at that time. B: And so, uh, it is, uh, uh, high quality grade music, B: and, of course, now they're getting, they also have a jazz section, B: and they also have a, uh, more contemporary and American uh, composer section. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, I had heard good things about the, uh, Music Heritage Society, A: but if I get involved in one of those things, I end up spending all my money on on music. B: Yeah. B: Well, you can control it. A: I almost, uh, almost, uh, bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago. B: Oh, really. A: Yeah, A: my roommate signed me up. A: He got a bonus record, A: and I got a lot of bills B: I see. A: So we have to watch that. B: Well, that's good. A: Uh, do you play any instrument yourself? B: Yes, B: I, I play guitar and, and early years played saxophone. A: How do you feel about the Viet Nam war? B: Huh, well, um, you know, I guess it's pretty deep feelings, uh, B: I just, uh, went back and rented, uh, the movie, what is it, GOOD MORNING VIET NAM A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh. A: Yeah, A: I saw that as well. B: Got that, uh, uh, some insight there, to, to kind of help me put together the feelings. B: I really appreciated the, the whole, uh, English class where the, uh, the, uh, fellow just wouldn't do it, you know, B: the guy's gouging, gouging your eyes out, B: what are you going to do? A: Uh-huh. B: You know, what for him to finish me off B: And, uh, it, it was, uh, good to remember the, uh, that, that kind of Asian philosophy that, uh. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, were you ever in Viet Nam A: or, B: No, B: no, B: I was kind of an in-between, uh, finally drew a high draft number, B: and you? A: Um, I was much too young, A: I was born in sixty-seven, A: so. B: Oh A: Um, you know, both my, well, both my brothers were, um, draft age, A: but neither of them wound up going over, which, I think they were very happy for. B: Well, I, personally, uh, you know, uh, I just went in limbo. B: I had a passport and was ready to go or um, out of the country or join special forces, either one. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, I just didn't know. B: So, uh. A: Well, um, so well do you, do you feel that it was worth what we did over there? B: Um, yeah, B: just a second. A: Okay. B: Okay. B: Sure, B: now. Well, Mark, um, what was that again? A: Um, do you think, I mean, do you think, our the investment in lives and money was worth it? B: No, B: not, not really. A: I totally agree with that. Um. B: Um. A: What, what effects do you think it's had on our country? B: Downside. Um, uh, well, B: the says we should, uh, go into the grief that, that's there B: and, you know, presidents have always avoided that as a country. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's pretty serious, really, you know, B: lot of things that aren't being addressed. A: Uh-huh. A: I think you know, that's pretty typical that, of the entire, entire involvement over that, you know, that nothing was really addressed, A: it it wasn't, you know, it was never A: we, we announced that we were going to war, A: it was such a gradual and subtle, you know um, you know increasement of, of force that. B: Yeah. B: Gulf of Tonkin, uh, resolution B: and was it a dolphin or a torpedo. B: You remember that? A: I vaguely remember we, um, we had a, we had a, um, spy ship torpedoed or something. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: only only it was foggy B: and finally President Johnson said, well, they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo. A: Oh B: Isn't that something? A: Uh-huh. Um, A: so, um, do, do, do you think that like, uh, um, for example like in, in this past war, in the Persian Gulf war that, uh, that you see, it seemed to me that, that Bush was going, going to extraordinary lengths to, um, you know, prepare the country for war. B: Uh-huh. B: Hey Mark I've got to go, um. A: Yeah. A: Okay. B: We'll see you. B: I guess our five minutes are up according to me. B: Are they to you? A: Uh, I wasn't really keeping count. A: But I guess, A: good-bye. B: Yeah, B: okay, B: bye-bye. A: Bye. A: Okay. A: So, uh, Mike, what are your opinions on, uh, trial by jury? B: Well I work for an insurance company B: so I see a lot of, uh, verdicts that are pretty crazily decided. Um, by juries particularly, B: and I know in England the judges set all of the awards. B: You know juries will decide the guilt or innocence, B: but then they leave the awards up to more learned people. B: And I think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: That, that seems to make sense A: but leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the, uh, kind of the rate for different . B: Oh, exactly. B: Each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what, um, the going, you know, if you will the going, uh, award should be for a certain type of case, you know, within some kind of range. A: Uh-huh. B: When you get one way out like that B: but then really doesn't wind up penalizing the person that they went after. B: Who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us. If they get some of those mega awards against them. A: Right. B: You know, they're not going to sit there and lose money. B: If they are losing money, then they're going to raise rates. A: Right. A: they B: So it all comes filtering down to us all individually. A: Right. B: And, uh, granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged, you know. A: Well, how do you feel about setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb. A: Do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts? B: I don't know. B: You know some of the health insurance is written that way. You know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it pre specified in the policy so much B: but I don't know that you can necessarily put a, a value on somebody's limb, uh, arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases. A: Uh-huh. B: I think maybe you look at, uh, the age of the person and their station in life and, and, uh, how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up, you know, with, with that. B: I mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old. A: Huh. B: I, I think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there. B: And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing, A: Uh-huh. B: and that can be part of continuing education, maybe for judges A: Yeah. B: I don't know. A: Right. B: You know, to get into the economics of things, uh, B: because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards, it really, you know, ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away. A: Yeah. A: That's true. B: If it's a company, you know that they're insured. Unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages, A: Huh. B: I think those should be uninsurable. B: I think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that, that did the damage. A: Oh, out of A: As opposed to the insurance paying the bills, B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, we're, Who, who B: For, for honest mistakes where they've done something and, and something happens. B: One of their employees causes damage or something. B: Sure. That's what they buy insurance for. A: do they get, they get insured, they get insured from other insurance companies A: or how does that work? B: Well, I was just talking about any company. B: Uh, let's just say a lumber manufacturing company A: Oh, okay, A: your talking about B: and, uh, somebody is on the premises A: Sure. B: and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift B: and he pushes the wrong button B: and he drops a load of lumber on somebody B: and it injures, them. A: Okay. A: Well, B: Sure. B: Insurance should pay for that. A: But in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance, if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings. B: Well I'm not talking about any loss. B: I was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of, the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due. B: And then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a usually a lot less. B: But it's an, an amount they're, designed to sting them a little for their, negligence. For gross wanton negligence in a claim. A: That, A: For, oh, A: Uh-huh. B: And unfortunately the the, B: lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too. A: Uh-huh. B: So again, it never really penalizes, the company doing the wrong. A: Right. A: That will, B: They can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to. A: Huh. B: And if, if they know some practice is wrong, you know, B: I'm not talking about your isolated occurrences, B: I'm talking more about the, you know, the thing that they know, B: maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there B: and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that. A: Sure. A: Okay. B: Then I think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket. A: Go ahead B: Oh, okay B: Yeah, B: the, uh, subject is child care and how to determine child care, B: and that's, uh, an interesting one for me to talk about since I have no children, B: but I did run a child care facility for a while. A: Um. B: And, uh, have some, A: Well, you should, you should have some opinions on that, then. B: I do have some thoughts on that, B: yeah. B: Uh, it's, uh, an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for, or parent for a lot of people there, B: and, uh, it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities A: Well, I guess if I were going to choose, I mean, my first consideration would be safety. B: Right. A: My second consideration would be, uh, uh, health. B: Right. A: And, uh, I guess my third consideration would be, uh, warm, environment, warm personal environment. B: Well, right. B: Uh, in Texas, we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate on a, at an institutional level and at a, like a small home level B: so you meet the standards, B: but then after that there's, there's a lot more. B: I think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff, is qualification of people who work there, and in hiring people who would work at the, uh, day care, the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people, uh, in terms of, not just, just B: because somebody has a child or, uh, likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that that, uh, A: Oh, absolutely A: As a matter of fact, I believe that the safety and, and health, uh, issues, uh, depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children. B: Exactly. B: And that was the most difficult thing of all, to find the, the right people, the qualified people. A: And it's the most difficult of all for a parent, judge, uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving, B: Oh, A: but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children, and be aware of what the safety hazards are, B: Oh, exactly. B: And the other thing that's difficult in, uh, it's a too small setting, like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child, because you don't want to just warehouse the child, B: and I didn't want to run an institution where that was the case, where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four, five years or so important B: and you have to have the right kind of enrichment B: and that, that includes, uh, an atmosphere in which the child is safe and, and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for, B: but also his, uh, developmental needs are cared for, too. A: Maybe the right thing to do is to, uh, when a couple has a child, then they should both take, you say the first four or five years are the most important, and I think I would agree with that, they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting. B: That would be lovely. A: Get rid of all these child care centers, at least for young kids below the age of six. B: Uh-huh. A: And then uh, and then, of course, to make up for that, uh, the, uh, parents would have to work in their later years longer, you know, A: in other words, they probably would not work, may not, may end up not working at all in the twenties. Uh, B: Well, that's an interesting thought because, A: But then they have to work from age thirty or, or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety. B: That would be okay B: That would, that would help on the other end, too, in, in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be. A: Right, A: well, you know, the, uh, uh, the world is changing uh, from from, uh, industrial, uh, base to, uh, information base A: and so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work. B: Uh-huh. B: That's exactly right. A: All you have to do is have a sharp mind, A: and I believe that, uh, mental acuity is easy to sustain, maintain, if you just simply continue to exercise your mind. B: Oh. A: So I think a person could work, uh, into the seventies, eighties, even nineties for that matter, A: if they didn't have to do a lot of physical, uh, labor, they could maintain, uh, A: Your turn. B: Okay. B: Uh, I don't think they should abolish it B: I think, I think if they put it into force more often, they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got. A: But not for petty theft? B: Right. B: No, B: no. B: For major things like premeditated murder. Mass murders. Uh, you know, that type of thing. B: I don't think it should just be used loosely. A: Well, it should be used as a deterrent do you think? B: Well, A: Or should it be used, uh, B: Yes, B: yes. B: To prevent these people from ever getting out on the street. By, you know, some technicality. B: And they go down the line ten years B: and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before. A: Uh-huh. B: And, you know, that's about the only thing. B: Like for petty, for theft and, and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know, B: I don't think they should do that. A: Well, you know, there's this old, uh, Jewish, is it, saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. B: Oh, well, I guess, if I, if it was someone in my family, I'd probably feel that way. B: You know, I've never had anybody in my immediate family, uh, murdered B: and so I really wouldn't know. B: But, but I feel like if I did, I probably would feel that way. A: Well, one of the things I was thinking about is, uh, you know, from society's point of view, if you put a value on each person, what you want to do is to maximize the end game value. A: So if you have someone that, that destroys that value uh, then what you want to take steps to, uh, minimize the loss. B: Uh-huh. A: Of course, you have to also put value on the criminal. B: Right. A: So if you terminate him, that's a loss of value. B: Well, that's true A: So, you know, if you weight everyone equally, then you have to say, well the likelihood of not terminating him, A: if you don't terminate him, the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person. A: In other words, you'd have to, you'd have to murder more than one other person uh, in order to justify taking his life. B: Besides him. B: Okay. A: Another way you could do it is weight this value by, uh, the value to society of the people. Uh, which is pretty delicate thing to do. A: But one way of doing it is, uh, by income. A: So if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money, which is often times the case, then then he's obviously not worth very much B: His life isn't worth very much then A: and so, uh, the likelihood that, you know, maybe expected, expected murders by him is, is, uh, integrated over the income of the people, uh, that he murders is maybe, you know, a loss of, who knows, eight hundred thousand dollars. A: Uh, but if he only, uh, integrated, you know, integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is, uh, small, less than eight hundred thousand dollars, then you terminate him A: Of course, one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm, is you find that it's more easy, it's easier to, uh, to, uh, terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less. Which means, well B: Right. A: I suppose you could say, well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation. B: Potential. B: I mean that's, that's the key right there. Potential. A: Uh-huh. B: Now, are they, are they rehabilitative or, or not. A: Now that's all fine and well and, and, uh, good philosophical. A: But if you're involved yourself, personally B: Uh-huh. A: uh, I know I have a friend whose, uh, son was murdered, uh, on the night before his sixteenth birthday. A: And let me tell you, uh, I, I knew them personally, uh, not intimately, but quite well A: and, uh, you're talking about real trauma. I mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies. B: I can imagine. A: The father, you know, A: of course, a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get, I think, in terms of psychological impact. B: Yes. A: Uh, and, B: Was he murdered? B: Did they find who killed him? A: Oh, yes. A: They found him A: and he is on trial for capital murder. B: So it hasn't been a long time ago. B: Just recently. A: Uh, well, actually he has, I, I'm sorry. He was convicted, uh, A: and, of course, now, you know, and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process A: but B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: That appeals process, I mean, it's what, you know, really, you know, just drags out and out and out. B: My brother-in-law here in Texas, his, by marriage, my sister's, uh, husband, his sister was murdered down here by a guy in, in, well actually in Houston B: and, uh, he, B: Okay. B: Go ahead. A: Uh, well, you know, uh, I think public service is a worthy thing A: and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs, uh, such as Peace Corps that promote that. B: Uh-huh A: Probably the most popular they, they have, you have quite the problem with, uh, the ghettos, B: I don't know, B: do they call it the barrio down there. A: That's the barrios A: but it's, it's I don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city. A: It's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks. B: Yeah, B: but I heard that San Antonio, unlike like, like a city like San Diego it it just has a really bad problem. A: I grew up outside of Houston A: and I don't think, uh, as far as gang violence and things, I don't think it's any worse here than in Houston. B: Yeah, B: like say Houston. B: Now I would, now me not even knowing anything about Houston, I would think that it's a pretty calm city. A: Houston is not at all. B: No, huh, B: there's a lot of crime? A: Yes A: there's quite a bit of crime. B: Oh, my, um, B: yeah, B: like I, we're so protected up here, B: it's, it's really strange. B: I mean our red light district, I mean, uh, you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: and we're just so protected. B: But, it's, it's, over in the Mid East, especially Israel, it's just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system, when it comes to the Palestinians. B: You know, the Israelis can do anything they want B: but when it comes to Palestinians, if they're out in the street at night, it's, it's really looked on as odd. B: Um, usually they're, they're bussed in to the, the, um, Jewish neighborhoods, and the Jewish cities B: and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories. A: Huh. B: So they don't have that. B: But, uh, what do you think about the mess that's, we've created in Iraq? A: I think it's unfortunate, uh, as far as the Kurds are concerned, A: it, A: I B: It's just what do you do for them, B: you want to do something for them, B: but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the, the country. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: we can't get involved in their civil war, um, unfortunately, A: but we've kind of driven these people out. B: To do it, B: yeah, B: but you see President Bush is telling them rebel, you know, uh, uprise. B: And that's what they did B: and now they're like asking him for help B: and he's like, no we can't get involved. B: What my husband had very strong feelings, B: he, uh, agreed with, um, the General Schwartzkopf, B: he said, um, he should have let, Bush should have let him finish his job. A: Sure. B: He should, he should have let them, um, corner the Republican Guards, A: Well I think the war ended too soon. B: Yeah, B: exactly, B: that's what everyone says. A: Yeah. B: everyone I talk to, they says, you know, B: it's real easy to say that. A: We, we didn't damage enough of their arsenal. A: We damaged most of it A: but we, we should have gotten, made sure we got everything. B: Yeah, B: I don't think the higher ups were thinking about what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine. B: They're going, oh, well it's not going to hurt us B: so we're just going to let them go, B: but really we didn't think about the people that he was going, B: and I mean, he, he's just, A: Unfortunately though, the, the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of Kuwait. A: And once that was accomplished it, B: They, yeah, they, they did, they stuck right to their goals, A: Yeah. B: and right, B: what they were going to say. B: And the American people, when this first started, they were even reluctant to let them do that. A: Yeah. B: So they were, they were playing it very safe, B: but, you know, it, an ounce what do they say, an ounce of hind sight is worth, whatever. A: Yeah. B: they, I don't know, they, it, Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done B: and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it, to you know, the, uh, the go ahead to do it. A: Yeah. B: Because he had the B: he knew what was going to happen, more than any of us. B: it was going to make such a mess. B: I mean I feel really sorry for these people, B: these people are middle class people, just like us. B: Can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood, A: Yeah. B: and you knew this, B: these people are going to come B: and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you. B: Of course, you're going, just going pick everything up that you can carry B: and you're going to run. A: Uh-huh. B: And it, it's just too bad that we couldn't see that. A: I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet. That I, I still feel like there's more to come. A: I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned. B: Well you know what I was hoping? B: I was hoping Iran was going to take a very, um, dramatic stand and invade, you know, B: and then like Iran's the big bad guy, you know, B: but, really, if, if they were going to save people's lives, A: They've got sixty or so of Iraq's planes. B: Yeah, B: I know, B: it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict B: but, I, I, you know, I almost swear, I'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians, B: why they didn't go save, B: I mean, I don't know if the Kurdish, B: I know the Shiites are their people. A: Uh-huh. B: But, I don't know, B: I think they have a bond with the, the Kurds. A: There are some Kurds living in Iran. B: Yeah, B: I, I think they should have just done more, uh, B: and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid. B: It's, it's just so complicated. A: I was real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as, as much as they did. B: Oh, yeah, B: well, you, B: knowing them, they're very, um, oh, B: I don't know, B: almost compare them to a very egotistical man. A: Uh-huh. B: You're damn right, B: I'm going to protect my family, you know, B: so, I, I was amazed too. B: I was really, I was really, um, proud of them, though, that they stayed out of it. B: But, A: Yeah, A: it and from, from what I can tell if they had gotten into it, it would have started a whole new war. B: Oh yeah, B: I was, I B: that part scared me. B: That, that, um, the Egyptians would pull out B: and I just saw atomic bomb, A: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, A: I, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on A: and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. A: That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, A: because I, because we never went to war. A: I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out A: and I, I feel like it went on and on. B: Right. A: And I, I guess I see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had, where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for, for what was happening. B: Right. A: You know, I just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman A: and I'm not sure that's our role, A: but. B: Yeah, B: I, I agree with that, B: I was, I was fairly young at the time too, B: I, I really don't have very many memories about it at all, in fact. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, my husband is a Vietnam veteran B: and you know, he in looking at the Persian Gulf war that just went on, he, B: it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have, from the people or the administration, either one. A: of static throughout Don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time? A: I mean I do think that, it's been too long in coming A: but I feel like maybe the American people and, and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that that those, B: Right. A: so many people were opposed to the war, A: what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it A: and those guys were there doing their duty. B: That's right, B: I mean, they weren't there by choice B: and, and, A: Yeah, A: and I, I think that we learned from that A: and I think it, it's one of those things that you learn the hard way. A: It was a tragic mistake, B: Right. A: the way that they have been treated over the years and I believe that's just now turning around. Just now, you know, trying to be rectified A: and I'm, and I'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally, on so many of the people. B: Right. B: No, B: I don't think you can B: and I, I agree with you that I, I think that the, the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in, in, in every aspect of it B: and I, I agree with you also, that I feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war. B: I mean they're still not settled over there. A: No, A: they're not. B: And I have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way. A: Yeah. B: I think we're going to end up back there in a few years or, if, if not sooner. A: Well I, I appreciate the A: I feel like President Bush is in a hard spot. A: He went over there to get them out of Kuwait, which he did. B: Uh-huh. A: And then he has backed out, A: he has pulled out. A: And I realize they're still saying, well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein, A: so why aren't you helping us? A: And you see, I think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation. B: I think it would too. A: And I don't think the U S will stand for it. A: I don't think he would do that, B: No, A: uh, I think we learned too much of the effects. B: Yeah, B: I agree with that. A: Uh, you know whether it was justified or not, I know, that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause. A: I, I feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and, and beat the communism, B: Uh-huh. A: but, but I think somewhere that got lost. You know, in the long term effects of the, of the war B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: and, B: you have to, you know, you have to give Bush a lot of credit for he, he said that's what we were going there to do B: and he did what, what he said B: and he did pull out before it got any further than that where, where it would have turned into more of a police action. Uh, or more of a political action I guess, you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do as, as another country. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: I mean, my, my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries B: and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address. A: That we don't get fixed. B: That's right. A: I know. B: And, and that's what frustrates me more than anything. A: And I, I believe that we have to have a military A: and I believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us. B: Right. A: But I also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward. B: I think there's a lot of waste B: and, and they don't, if they could just cut out all the fat and, and get it lean, and start addressing some of the other issues, B: I think we could take care of everything. And quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world, you know, who just end up using things against us later on anyway. A: I know, A: I do think that in the Middle East war, um, A: I think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with, uh, kind of a different attitude. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, I think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more. B: Right. A: An, uh, and I think that's good, you know, B: Yeah. A: I think that's a good, B: Yeah, B: a lot of good has come from this one. A: I think so too. B: And I think, I guess, in, in, uh, ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war B: because like we, we said earlier, that, you know, the a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of, of that war B: and and, A: And perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam. B: Right, B: exactly. A: So, I, I, I do think that, we've learned from it, B: Uh-huh. A: you know, I, I, I wish there weren't war B: Yeah, B: no kidding. A: But, uh, I do think we learned. B: And I just, I just hate the emotional price a lot of the Vietnam people paid, for, you know, nothing. A: Yes. B: I mean, it was, they're, they still don't know what they were there for. A: No, A: there was no feeling of accomplishment, no goal, A: no, B: No. A: we went in A: but what did we do. A: We lost lives A: and, and what were we trying to do. A: Who knows. B: Yeah, B: that's true. A: And, I, I think you're right, A: uh, I think you're right there. A: Um, I do remember when it was over. A: I remember when they were coming home. A: Uh, but, I remember the feeling back then, you know, A: like I feel like right now, I feel like this country has been behind this war. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, yeah, A: there's a lot of people that aren't for war. A: I'm not for war, B: Right. A: but I believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right. A: I don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam. B: Right. A: I just remember, A: oh yeah, A: our guys are over there A: and it's sad A: and we shouldn't be fighting a war A: but there was no, let's support them, you know. B: Right, B: the, B: when this war broke out it frustrated me all the antiwar people and, you know, their, all the demonstrations that were going on. A: Yeah. That's right. B: I felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity B: because those kind of people, I mean, you know, they're the kind of people who are, who've always got to have a cause, whether it's good, bad of indifferent. B: They've got to have a cause B: and, and, I, you know, nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're, you're supporting the war. B: you have to support the people that are there. A: That's right. B: And for some reason those people don't see that. A: They don't see it as supporting the folks, the people. B: No, B: no, B: they don't B: and, you know, they're just real shallow people. A: I would agree with you there B: Yeah. A: I, I agree. A: Um, and I, and I recall when President Bush said that, you know, A: he said look, A: I, you know, I'm sorry that you're opposed to the war. A: There's a lot of us that are opposed to war A: but, uh, you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing. A: And I remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that. B: Yeah, A: But, B: I mean they're not helping anybody. B: That's the, that's the whole point, A: not. B: they're not doing anything for anybody except themselves. A: That's true. B: And I don't even know what they're doing for themselves. You know. A: Uh. A: Giving a soapbox to stand on B: Yeah A: But, well, I just, I, I'm glad we've learned. A: I'm sorry we had the experience of Vietnam. B: Yeah. A: And, uh, and I'm, I'm, I'm especially sorry for the people that are, you know, have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally, A: because, you know until the past four or five years, nobody ever really worried about that, for them. B: That's true. B: Yeah. A: And, and I think that's where we as American people really failed, you know, failed them. B: Uh-huh, B: yeah. A: So, I don't know. A: Well, do you have anything else you want to say on this? B: No, B: I guess not. A: I think this is the first time that I haven't been cut off by the computer B: I know, B: we get cut off all the time, too A: Usually I can talk all day A: but this is something to me that's sad B: Yeah, B: it is. A: So, well have a good day A: and I appreciate the conversation. B: Thanks, B: same here. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye-bye. A: So the general topic is hobbies. B: Yes. A: Let's hear about your hobbies. B: Well, let's see, B: what kind of hobbies do I have? B: I guess, uh, I, it's more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing. B: I enjoy playing basketball and, and basically all kinds of sports. B: And, uh, A: Any handicrafts? B: Excuse me. A: Any handicrafts? B: No, B: not, not really, um, B: no, B: I'm really not too creative B: well, I, uh, you know, around with my hands and things like that B: I leave that more up to my Mom A: So, um, I think I'm in handicraft. B: Oh, yeah. A: I think it will become resume writing. B: Oh, well, let's hope that you, you aren't employed by that craft for too long. A: Uh, yeah, A: I, I hate to think about it A: and, and I'm getting rather good at reading want ads. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: it, it, B: what kind of time frame is it, uh, looking for the, uh, different shifts up there? A: I A: who knows. B: Is it, uh, B: basically, I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it, Texas, A: No, A: all means about fifteen to twenty percent, of, of, oh, B: Oh, wow. A: I'm sure the number's somewhere classified A: but some of the internal news and the news services, A: so, it's approximately six fifty, B: Uh-huh. A: so ten percent of six fifty, is sixty-five A: and twenty percent would be one thirty. B: Wow, B: how about that. B: Yeah, B: that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney. A: Yeah, A: that's possible. B: How about that. B: Well, that's, uh, that's unfortunate B: is there many other, B: are you in the defense? A: Oh, yes, . B: Is it, uh, many other corporations in the area? A: Uh, I saw Seven Eleven that was hiring. B: Well, I'm sure with the new, uh, contract awarding B: I, I think it went to Lockheed, didn't it? A: Yes. B: That, uh, I hear they're hiring all over the place for that. A: Yeah, uh, A: no, A: Apple's coming to town A: and, and that has some opportunities B: Oh, really? A: and, uh, and, B: Now is that ad good just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs? A: Colorado Springs specifically, A: yes. B: How about that. A: And, uh, and, uh, M C I coming if, if, telemarketing is your bag. B: Uh-huh. A: Personally I'd rather die a slow painful death A: but, B: Well, you in the, uh, computer operations or in the actual, uh, manufacturing? A: Uh, I'm a defense worker. A: I'm, government tool control specialist. B: Right, B: yeah, B: that's why I was in the Deseg down here in Plano also. A: Are you still employed? B: Am I still employed by T I, B: no, B: I took a leave of, of T I back in November. A: Oh. B: Actually, December was my first month away from them. A: Exempt or ? B: Exempt. A: Oh, yes. B: It, uh, unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't, uh, it was purely by my own choice. B: It wasn't, uh, there was no incentive for myself to leave, B: but it was just an opportunity arose B: and decided to take it. A: Oh, so, you didn't even get the severance package. B: No. B: I should have taken the, the, the, you know, uh, option when that was there, B: but it was just, I missed it by a couple months. B: But, you know, what can one do. B: I'm just happy still to have a job. A: So, are you happy with what you are doing now? B: Yeah, B: I am kind of happy with it, B: it's getting better all the time, B: I knew it would be different from the very beginning, B: but, you know, as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system, B: so I was in the computer operations B: it's, uh, you know, it all starts to become similar B: there's, you know, there's benefits B: and there's things that weren't as good, A: Yeah. B: but as an overall package, I'd say I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out. A: Good, A: good. A: Well, it hasn't been a long time T I A: or I, I'm significantly shaken by the situation, but not devastated. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the, the fact that, that is more in the support of the manufacturing B: and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the the defense area but manufacturing in general. A: To tell you the truth, I'm, I'm, I'm not really worried. B: Uh-huh. B: That's great. B: That's good. A: And, and I seem rather happy about it most of the time, just, just to know, what's, possibilities are, you know, what might happen. B: Uh-huh. B: Sure, B: yeah. B: Sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table. A: But still in all, it feels funny. B: It may be a blessing in disguise. B: I know a number of people who are, uh, surplused B: and they're just, B: actually, what the positions that they found outside of the company were much, much better than the ones that they currently had inside. A: So, despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or going for walks in the mountains, I can't seem to get into it right now. B: Exactly. B: Uh-huh, B: well, I'm sure it's just with the, the, the, the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you decide on a pass , A: Uh, situational. A: I've, I doubt I'll be here in six months. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, would you like to be there? A: I, A: all things being equal, yes. B: Uh-huh. A: But, or, or even somewhere better, B: Sure. A: but, God this is much better than west Texas. B: Uh-huh B: Well, just take the day, A: But then they, they tell me Hell is much better than west Texas. B: Well, actually, uh, the, the Plano, Dallas, Houston, you know, Austin that whole area is, is actually quite, quite nice. A: I, my little brother lives in Austin right now. B: Oh, that's a beautiful place. A: Goes to U T. B: Uh-huh. B: That's just fantastic down there. B: Take it more as a, B: this is your opportunity to do whatever you want, B: pick out where you want to live, B: and then once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do. A: I see that's the problem. A: For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do, and where I want to go. And just kind of go with the punches. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Sure. A: And now I feel lost. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: that's a, B: it, it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it. A: Oh, I had job offers. B: Uh-huh. A: But, I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave. A: And that, B: Uh-huh. B: Well, the best thing about it is that you can, uh, try something B: if you don't like it, shoot, move on to something else. B: That's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here, B: I'll take a chance, B: if I don't like it, I'll go someplace else, do something different. A: Oh so, had you been with T I long when you changed? B: Five years. B: Yeah. A: I've been with them sixteen. B: Yeah, B: I can imagine, you know, the longer and longer it goes, A: Actually, seventeen now, A: and, oh, yeah, A: momentum is, uh, driving force in our lives. B: Uh-huh. A: But so, yeah, A: I'm looking as, as a opportunity. B: Well, that's good, B: you've got a good attitude about it. A: And, and I'm looking at it as a change. B: Uh-huh. A: And I'm looking at it as, as an adventure. B: Right, B: there you go. B: That's the way to do it. A: And maybe I'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I don't get laid off between now and then. B: There you go, B: that's the thing to do. B: That's much funner than doing any kind of job. A: Ha, how about we end this? B: That will work out just fine. A: Nice talking to you. B: All right, B: nice talking to you. A: Bye. B: Good-bye. A: What's the, uh, A: in Texas law has a, uh, what does it have, it has a death penalty doesn't it? B: Oh, yes, B: yeah. B: They just, uh, started it again, too just late, or, within the past few years B: You know for quite some time, just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty. A: But now it's coming back into favor. B: Uh, yes. B: Well, they find it is more deterrent. A: Well, my sociology class at S M U's taught us that it was not a deterrent. A: Uh, but now that's just what they said. A: Uh, I don't know maybe, maybe if I went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent. B: Well, uh, if you, You know, compare the figures, I think that's where they're, uh, they're coming from. A: Maybe they've changed their minds. B: The, uh, A: Maybe that's it. A: Maybe that's it, A: because that was back in the seventies. B: Oh, they're yes. They are. B: That was before the, uh, uh, they adopted the death law again B: But, uh, I, I myself am in favor of it, uh, particularly for, uh, well I think Texas has a good, good law. Uh, crimes, murders related with, uh, drugs or killing a policemen. A: I think, A: I agree. A: But I think it ought to be expanded to include children. A: I, I think they're, they have they're working on, uh, something in Austin now, B: Uh-huh. A: and I'm not sure what it is, A: I just remember seeing a, uh, kind of a synopsis of it. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, why stop at children? B: Why not go to adults, too? A: Well, uh, I'm, I'm personally very in favor of it. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or or tried to, or done their very, you know, given their best effort at doing that. B: Uh-huh. B: Yep. A: I, I don't care to support them. B: Well, I don't either B: but, uh, uh, but there is something to be said about B: or, uh, uh, just for the sake of argument, I'm taking the, a con, A: Sure. B: I'm, I'm against it. B: Uh, you know yourself how many times have you heard where, uh, uh, a citizen was wrongfully arrested, and served time at a penitentiary, uh, A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh B: just recently this, uh, black man served nine years was it, for robbery. A: And then, there was the black woman that, uh, robbed and shot the furrier. A: And she was set free, too, just in two examples in Texas recently. B: Uh-huh. A: But she actually killed the furrier. Or someone, A: she was charged with murder A: and then, then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something. A: I didn't, I don't, I didn't retain all those facts very well. A: But I know what you're, A: what if we make a mistake. B: That's it. A: And that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, right now our laws are so liberal that, uh, even with the death penalty in effect, I don't think that, uh, they're going to use it, uh, too frequently, uh, unfortunately. B: I, like you, say yes B: let's have it, put them all, give them all a shot, get rid of them. A: Well, Well, I guess, though, where I would have a problem with it if I were on the jury that, that, put, that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty. B: Why should they be sitting in, uh, prison getting their college degree. B: Uh-huh. A: Now that's tougher. A: It's easier to say it on the telephone A: and everyone agree that, yeah, the death penalty's the way to go, A: it's a deterrent to crime, A: they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway. A: But to be the actual one of the ones that decide, that would be tougher for me. B: Yes, B: very true. B: I, uh, I agree with you there. Uh-huh. A: I think I'd probably do it A: but we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance. A: It, that's, that's, that's a real easy thing to say that, oh, sure I would, A: but I don't know B: Well, I myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that. B: Uh, I, it, it's, uh, that's an awful lot to, uh, to expect of a person, to, uh, to kill somebody is what it amounts to. A: Well, yes, A: but, you know, that's what they did. B: It, B: true. B: Very true. B: But they, they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason. A: Or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted. B: Yeah Uh-huh A: And they, they wanted something worse than they, more than they respect the human life. B: Yeah, B: exactly. B: Well, anyhow I guess we both agree that, that it is, it should be in effect. A: Hang them. A: Yeah, A: I agree it should be in effect. A: Also I agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement, uh, A: so I guess I would say I want it to be in effect A: but I want maybe A: well, I'd, I, now I have a problem with this, too. A: I think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance. B: Oh, that's true. B: Well now any, uh, just believe in just about any state in the union, uh, uh, a death, uh, or, uh, yeah, death verdict is an automatic, uh, appeal. A: That's correct. A: It is, A: it is. B: And, uh, uh, yes, B: I'm inclined to agree with you. B: I think so, B: there should be a limit as to the number of appeals. A: Now, there's some, A: and maybe, now, I don't remember if this is Texas or not, that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence. B: Um, um, well, Not just for dealing in drugs. A: Convicted drug dealers. B: It, uh, A: Is it, what is, what's the B: There are certain circumstances, B: and I don't remember what they are. A: It's something of the they're on the distribution end. B: Uh, yes. A: They're not selling them, A: they're distributing them. A: It's for the large dealers is what, it's reserved for. B: Uh-huh. A: And they, they are in effect killing people. B: Oh, oh, yes, B: yes. B: I, I believe it's any capital crime related to drugs. A: Oh, okay. B: I think that's the way it's worded. A: Is that how it's worded? A: I knew it was there A: but, I, I, A: or or is it proposed A: or is it passed? B: I do believe that's in. B: Uh, I wouldn't swear to it myself. A: I believe it is, B: But I thought it, I thought it was in effect. A: I believe you're right, though. A: I think it is. A: And I have to agree with that. B: Uh-huh. A: I, I think it certainly should be one of the options. A: Uh, I've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren, so far that I know. A: I qualify that heavily, A: because you never know, A: but to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet. Well, my children are about in the same age bracket. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, it does. B: Uh, I have four sons myself B: and the youngest is twenty-eight, B: so they are all pretty well grown up B: and they all went through it, you know, going through high school and everything B: and knock wood that, uh, they have not, B: well I won't say they didn't try it, uh, B: I wouldn't know, B: but, uh, they, B: I doubt very much that they're, they're using it now. B: In fact I'm sure they don't. A: I think, let's see, the oldest is thirty-two A: and the youngest is probably twenty-seven, twenty-eight. B: Huh. A: So, it's the same age bracket. B: Yes. A: And there's four, two girls and two boys. A: And I think one of each experimented very slightly with pot, B: Uh-huh. A: and I think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge. B: Yeah. B: That's usually the way it is. B: It, it's just, uh, try it out with their peers B: And none of them even smoke. B: They don't, uh, B: they never, B: strangely enough, uh, their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up. B: Now, my, my, my wife, my ex-wife, she quit, uh, well, when she was pregnant with the last one B: and she never started up again. B: And I just quit, oh, about fourteen months and two weeks ago. A: Boy, A: that's tough. B: Yes, B: it is. B: I, B: and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by. A: My husband hasn't quit, yet. A: And he knows he has to A: and he knows he should A: and he knows A: and he knows, B: Um. A: but he hasn't. A: I do respect the fact, though, that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me. A: He, he's very conscious of, of passive smoking A: and he's concerned about it but, hasn't quite made it yet B: Well, Well, when I was still smoking, I, I felt that way. B: If I was in a public restaurant, seated at table with, uh, non smokers I would try to pick a a, a my, seat where the smoke would blow away from them. B: Or I'd hold the cigarette under the table. A: Yeah, A: I've seen all of this, A: yeah B: And, uh, but, uh, now I'm on, the shoe's on the other foot B: Uh, I'm aware of other people smoking now. A: Well, Charles will actually, Charles will not smoke in anyone else's house except our own. B: Um. A: He will get up A: and he'll go outside, you know, A: and he, he's A: so, when we're invited to people's house, he will not smoke in their house. Which I think is good because there's a lot of people that are very, B: Yes. A: particularly if they have children. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, and he's, you know, he tries his best, A: but the actual quitting he hasn't done. A: He changed brands to a brand he doesn't like. A: He put up all of his ash trays. A: He will not smoke in a comfortable position, you know, A: but still he's done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking B: Uh, uh-huh. A: It's a, long process. B: Well, the, there's a trick I use. B: They used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment. A: Oh, how neat. B: And every time I wanted one I have to go outside and just take one. One at a time. B: And, uh, that, that 's, gets to be, uh, a deterrent. A: He has his in the kitchen, A: It seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution. B: Yeah. A: And, I can very clearly remember ten years ago I was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and, and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful A: and we did end up with, uh, I B M, P C which I now would not have chosen B: Really? A: But that was before the Macintosh. B: Yeah. A: And twenty years ago I was, uh, in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter B: Oh, I know it. A: So I would say that's one of the largest changes in, at least in my life. B: Yeah, B: I, I've seen that just in the last, uh, even five years how much they've uh, increased in use. Or probably eight years, B: when I was a freshman in college uh, my degree was in computer, uh, technology originally A: Uh-huh. B: and it seemed like it would, B: they were just getting out with the, you know, the disks and all that, getting away with the cards, you know, doing away with the, the programming cards A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: and, uh, A: Yeah, A: thirty years ago I, I had a college job, uh, working as a programmer A: and we had to write code in binary A: and, uh, have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which, I don't think exists anymore. B: I know. B: No. A: You never see one of those punch cards anymore. B: Uh, I think T V has a lot to do with the changes, too. Don't you? In, like, people's attitudes. A: Well, very possibly. A: Uh, I'm not sure in the last ten years it's been very different from before. A: Uh, certainly in the last thirty I would say there have been significant changes. Even, even the change from black and white to color television. B: Yeah. A: Thirty years ago I guess there were color T V A: but I sure didn't have access to one. B: Oh. A: And, uh, but, twenty years ago, practically everybody had a color T V, A: and now I think they're as, almost as many, well, A: there are more T V than households, A: so it's close to getting, uh, one T V per person they say B: Yeah B: And now everybody, uh, has V C R and two or three V C R and that kind of thing. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Certainly ten years ago, uh, V C R were just coming on the market A: so that's made a significant difference in the way I watch television for instance, A: because, uh, now I almost never watch a T V program when it's on. B: Yeah. B: I know. A: I tape it and then watch it when it's convenient A: and that way I don't have to worry about being interrupted. A: I can just put it on pause B: Yeah, B: and you can, you can flip through the commercials B: so you don't have to watch the commercials. A: Right. B: That's always convenient. A: Uh-huh. A: Yes, A: you can watch a program in forty-five minutes instead of an hour A: You skip the commercials. B: Uh-huh B: So, what was our question about, decline in A: Wasn't the decline so much. A: I think they just said the changes in, uh, social, social changes in the United States. B: Yeah. A: How was life different ten, twenty, or thirty years ago. A: So, B: Well, I can't really remember back that far, B: but ten years ago, uh, I don't know. I'd say, like in the nineteen seventies you remember how kids would walk around with A M, what do you call those, little A M radios A: Yes. B: and now people have jam box with C D players in them, you know. And, hand held T V and car phones. A: Yes. A: That's certainly, a difference. A: Yeah, A: that's another one, A: yeah, A: car phones is a good point, and, uh, cellular phones of all types and beepers. A: Uh, ten years ago I was working in a job at a medical center B: Yeah. A: and I had to carry a beeper around A: and they were kind of bulky A: and all they did was just, uh, make a beep noise A: and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call. B: Uh-huh. A: These days they have these tiny little things that are only about the size of two or three pencils A: and they fit in your shirt pocket A: and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a, a phone number to respond to A: and, B: Those are cool. A: Yeah, A: those are pretty neat. A: And they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off, in a theatre or something B: Yeah. A: and you can still get your messages B: Yeah. A: But, let's see, social changes, uh, uh, B: Where do you think it's, where do you think it's going to go in twenty years? A: I haven't the slightest idea. A: I was just thinking, though, about a, a huge social change in the last ten years is AIDS. B: Yeah. A: It was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago. A: I, I know that because I was writing a paper about it. B: Uh-huh. A: I was writing a, a journal article. A: Uh, and they still didn't even know what caused it or anything. A: And, uh, there was a suspicion, that it was a virus B: Wow. A: but nobody had identified it A: and they were really just going on epidemiological, uh, uh, guesswork, uh, because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like, uh, hepatitis B: Uh-huh. A: and then, from, from the spread pattern of hepatitis, they could work backwards to the transmission by, uh, blood and semen. B: Yeah. A: And then I, B: I'm curious what was your, uh, graduate study in? A: Well, I, I was in English as a matter of fact, and medieval studies, B: Oh, wow. B: Uh-huh. A: uh, but I went to work as an editor and writer, A: so, uh, uh, the, ten years ago I was working in the medical center, uh, publishing a journal and writing about medical topics B: Yeah. A: And, let's see, twenty years ago, I guess we 're were just beginning to get into what they were calling the, uh, the sex revolution where, uh after the pill B: Yeah. A: and, uh, uh, freed people up from worries about, uh, illegitimate pregnancy A: and, I guess in the seventies is the, the time when that was supposed to have exploded. A: Thirty years ago there was no pill. B: Uh-huh. B: You think that's caused a lot of pressure on, like younger kids today, to make choices that they probably shouldn't have to make? A: Yes. A: I do. A: I really do. A: I have, uh, four kids in college right now, children and stepchildren B: Yeah. A: and I know that the expectation for them was, uh, to have sex and, much earlier, than the expectation when I was in college. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: In my day, we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be, sleeping with their boyfriends B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: But, they certainly didn't expect everybody to A: and it was really only, uh, acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in, in the relatively near future. B: Uh-huh. A: And I certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays. B: Oh, yeah. B: It's kind of scary when I think of what will happen in twenty years, you know, when I have kids and they're grown and uh, just kind of some of the changes that will happen even more B: so. A: And I guess the answer, is, is, stay flexible because nobody can predict what's going to happen in twenty years B: Seems like it can't get much worse. B: Yeah. A: I certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what, uh, my kids were likely to be like. A: Course, one of them was just a, a, a brand new baby twenty years ago, A: so I sure wouldn't have been able to predict for him. B: Uh-huh. B: Um. A: And some of the other ones weren't born. B: Yeah. B: So, sounds like America's going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and worldwide communication A: Yeah. B: and, A: Electronic mail. B: Yeah. A: I just got on that this past, about a year ago A: and that's made a difference in the way I do my job because it's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things. Even when they're on another continent. B: Yeah. B: It's pretty wild. A: Yeah. A: Even, you know, A: that reminds me, Federal Express was around ten years ago, A: but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency B: Uh-huh. A: and nowadays people use Fed Ex, all the time. B: Yeah. B: Sure do. Huh. A: People do seem to travel more. A: It's much more common for people, even teenagers to be going to Europe and South America and, Asia. B: Yeah. A: Uh, I was almost thirty before I got off this continent. B: Yeah. A: And, uh, both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school B: Yeah B: I know that's what, uh, what my family was talking when I picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana B: and they were like, well, you know, thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that, you know. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, especially come home every couple months. A: Yeah. B: You know, and, A: Okay, A: what do you think are some current trends in, uh, the way families spend time together, based on what you've seen. B: Um, I, I think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together. A: Yeah B: Um, I think, uh, like in my situation, today, on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together, my husband's been off doing his thing all day today, B: and I've been off doing my thing all day B: and I haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning. A: Really. B: So, uh. A: Are you newly married, A: or, B: Um, two years. A: Yeah. A: Same, same situation here, I've been married about ten months, A: so. Yeah, A: I can, I can, I know what you mean. B: It's, it's really hard, hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and, uh, you both have hobbies that are different. A: Yeah. B: you know, if you have hobbies that are the same, then, you know, you can enjoy your hobby together, B: but my husband and I have different hobbies. A: Is he a hunter and a fisher and all that. B: No, B: no, B: he's a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector. A: That's that's wild. B: Um, so he was off today, uh, looking at, at records. A: Uh-huh. B: So, uh, and I was off, you know, doing, you know, household type things. You know, laundry A: Yeah. B: and, um, did some shopping and stuff. A: Um, from the people I've talked to, I don't know if I should bring this into it, A: but, um, a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more, um, where they could manage their own schedule A: and, uh, they could spend more time with their kids B: Uh-huh. A: because they look back A: and, you know, they're all like, um, kind of regretful, I think. B: Yeah, B: I, I think, I think that would be the ideal situation, B: I think that would be the ideal situation. B: I think that a lot of people, B: like in my case I, I do shift work. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't, I don't have that choice. A: Yeah, A: same here. B: Um, I have to be at work at, at X hour, you know, at just, at, at a certain hour B: and I can't, it's not flexible. A: Yeah. B: Um, it, it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours B: and, and maybe after we decide to have kids I, I might find a job that has flexible hours. B: I I hope so anyway. B: Um, but I would, I don't know. A: At T I, is that where you work? B: Uh-huh. A: It's really kind of sad, A: some of the people that I work with they, like when I worked on second shift, um, their their kids go to school during the day A: and then they wouldn't see them at night, because they would be in, you know, at work and the kids are all ready in bed. B: Uh-huh. A: And so it was kind of like, they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses. A: This relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends, or something, you know. B: Yeah. A: So it was really sad, you know that a lot of families, um, have to, well, you know, have to have dual income. A: A lot of people choose to, which is fine. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, you know, then the kids kind of suffer. B: Yeah, B: I, ideally, it it would be nice to be able to just have, like, back in the old days, you know, back like when I grew up, you know, A: Uh-huh, huh strangely, high A: Yeah. B: the, the mom stayed home, you know, and raised the kids. B: My mom didn't go back to work until I was in junior high school. A: Yeah. B: Um, so she was there pretty much all my, you know, formative years. A: Yeah. B: And that was nice B: and I liked that B: and I would hope that I would be able to give that to my kids. A: Uh. B: But I think with the way the future is, um, economy wise, B: I don't think it's going to be realistic. A: I know. A: Unfortunately, that's probably true. A: Um, do you think the, the parents spend quality time with their kids A: are do you think it's more like watching T V and stuff like that, not really, uh ... B: I, yeah, I, I think that, I think very few spend quality time. B: I think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff, stuff like that. A: Yeah B: I think that, um, uh, most, most kids that I see don't really, they don't really value quality time. A: Yeah A: it's always that way until it's too late. B: Until, until they're older B: and then they look back. A: Yeah, A: it's true, um. A: What's, what are some other questions they have, A: , I'm not sure. A: I know my parents are growing up, A: I guess they never spent much time watching T V. A: In fact, I've never seen my mom turn on the T V, A: we didn't really have one . B: Oh really. A: Yeah, A: and, and they spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff, A: but, you know, my dad had his own business A: and it was easier for them to do that, A: but, I, I don't know, A: it was, I guess I didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time. B: I, I think kids now a days are raised on T V. B: I mean that's, that's almost like a T V a surrogate parent. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: that's a good way to put it. B: And not a, and not a very good one at that. A: Yeah, A: that's a pretty good way to put it A: If I had kids, well if you had kids, what kind of things do you hope to do? like paper B: Um, I, I hope to, of course, be able to teach them right from wrong. B: I hope, I hope to be able to spend, um, their growing up years, being in the home, you know, not having to work. Um, and being able to do, A: Yeah. B: I, I, I know a lot of people who, um, um, B: I work part-time also, B: and I B: a lot of people that I work for are, mothers that stay home. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, and they, they do a lot of volunteer work B: and they're real active in the community B: and, um, they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working. A: Uh-huh. B: And I'd, I'd like to be able to do that. B: I'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids. A: Do volunteer work and, be in clubs and stuff, B: Yeah. A: yeah, A: I agree. A: I hope that happens, in my case. B: Yeah, B: but, I think that's for the, the few and far between. B: I think that, uh, probably ninety percent of the, of the, um parents out there are, are probably working parents. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. Huh B: And I, I don't, I don't really see that, that trend changing much, B: if anything, I think, there's going to be fewer and fewer, uh, single income families. A: I know. A: Yeah, A: and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids. That may not necessarily be consistent with yours. B: Yeah. B: Exactly. B: See I, I never, I don't even know what day care is really all about because I, I never went to a day care center, A: Yeah B: I never, I never had that kind of experience. A: Huh. I, well I don't even think we had A: I don't even remember them being around when we were little. B: Yeah, B: I, I see, it seems like that's, that's a big trend, you know, in the last ten years. B: Day cares have, have, have popped up and become a lot more, um, a lot bigger part of, of way to to, uh, cut costs A: and it's enjoyable, too. A: Very restful. A: I mean I find, B: Yeah, B: I, I do enjoy camping. A: Yeah, A: I find the outdoors very relaxing and, you know, kind of a change. B: As long as I have a shower nearby, I'm fine And electricity. A: Yeah A: Well, I'm with you. A: I need my creature comforts, too. B: Yeah. A: Well, it was great to talk to you. B: It was nice talking to you, too, Beth. A: Okay, A: see you later. A: Bye-bye. B: Okay. B: Bye-bye. A: What kind of painting are you planning to do? B: Well I have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting. A: Uh-huh. B: And, um, it's a rent house B: and I decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper B: so I decided I'm going to paint. A: Uh-huh. B: And I've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint. B: And I'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them. Either that or maybe rag rolling. To give it kind of a country look. A: Oh, what would be interesting. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments, A: but they look very interesting A: and you get some beautiful effects with them. B: Yeah. B: Uh, one of the books that I bought, where it's describing the sponge painting, said you can like layer different colors B: and, A: Yes, A: yeah, A: I've seen that done, where there's uh, oh, A: I saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat A: and then it had, a little bit darker sort of peachy color, B: Uh-huh. A: and in between there was a sort of a rust, uh, put on very sparingly. B: Ugh. A: And it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco. B: Yeah. B: Um, what I, what I'm trying to do is I've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms A: Uh-huh. B: so I want something that's going to tie that together B: and I'm changing the, like the towel racks and stuff, the, the fixtures out to make them wood, B: I'm going to put wood in there. A: Oh, yeah, A: that should be nice. B: So it's going to have kind of a country look. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, and I haven't even decided as far as, um, what kind of paint to buy. B: I don't have an actual instruction book B: so I'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now. A: Well, uh. B: Um, it's going to be a big experiment. A: Yeah, A: I was about to say, you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing B: Yeah. A: Because you might find that it's beyond, uh, what you're willing to put into it. Although I think it could turn out really nice. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Yeah, B: I've, A: I haven't ever done fancy painting A: but I sure did my share of just regular painting. A: Uh, I've painted several houses, inside. A: I, never painted the outside. B: Uh-huh, B: inside. B: What, what kind of, what kind of paint do you normally use? A: Well, uh, we used a latex, uh, wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork A: and my job was mostly the woodwork. B: Okay, B: uh-huh. A: My husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers A: and I got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine, uh, trim work, where I'd use a small brush and, uh, try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Well we only have only one of our bathroom has a window in it B: so I'm hoping that, um, it won't be too much of a, a problem. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, I'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first. Because I, I think, A: Well I was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it. B: No, B: I'm, I'm planning on taking it off. A: I have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now, which make it much easier to get wallpaper off. B: Um. A: Um, I tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago, oh, with a just a scraper and wet sponge A: and it took forever. A: I would not recommend that method. B: Okay. A: Uh, if if you can rent a steamer, if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble. B: Well that's something that, that's worthwhile checking into then. 'Cause I, A: If it's really old, you don't know what it's put on with. B: It, it's hard to tell, B: it's, B: the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style. A: Yeah. B: And I know the house, um, was built around the mid fifties. A: Uh-huh. B: So it may be the original wallpaper A: Could be, A: yeah. A: Um, if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too. A: If it's paper it will probably shred. B: Um, in one bathroom it's, um, it's probably paper, uh, B: it's silver, silver and yellow, and white. A: Um, uh-huh A: Well the wallpaper that I was trying to remove was black, A: this was in a bathroom too. A: And the, the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white A: and the, the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background A: and then it had vivid, uh, almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise, and lime green and silver, and, uh, a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that B: Um, that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom. A: Oh it was awful, A: it was absolutely hideous A: and, and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it A: and a, a guest went in there A: and he said it's a good thing I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something to drink and went in there I would think I was having hallucinations B: Really. B: Well I, I've also been thinking about, after looking at all these magazines, um, these design magazines and stuff, I'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too, in a color that will kind of, um, tie in our, um, our, um, our, uh, comforter, with a color that's kind of a, um, burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, and I'm not really quite sure, B: I don't know if maybe I'm biting off more than I can chew. A: Well I'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes A: and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale. B: Yeah, B: well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting. A: Sure. B: It wouldn't be any kind of special, um, special effects type thing. A: Yeah. B: It would be just plain paint. A: Well it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time. A: Because if you, uh, use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out, uh, all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto, you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it A: and it can be done a whole lot faster. And with rollers and, uh, modern latex paints, B: Um, okay. A: you can wash up easily because they're water soluble. B: Uh-huh. A: And they dry fast A: so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend. If you have some help. B: Um. A: And then if that, if you discover the little tricks and tips about, you know, how you get through corners and how you do trim and, uh, how long to leave the masking tape down, because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when it, when you pull it up. B: It, it peels the paint off when you take it off, B: yeah. A: Well, not, A: if you leave it on for weeks, it will do that. A: If you take it up the next day it should be fine. A: You want it to get dry, but not, uh, just real hard. B: Yeah, B: okay. A: You don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried to hard. A: That's the problem. B: Yeah. A: It will come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long. A: And I've, I was told, A: I always used the nice wide masking tape, A: but I've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth. Because it, it rips as you pull it off for one thing B: Oh really, B: okay. A: and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape B: Um. A: And the whole point of using it is to save yourself work. A: You can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape. A: But use, use good, uh, stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands, that will go down and come up easily. B: Okay. B: Well I really appreciate all the helpful tips, B: I think you are, just made my project a lot easier A: Well I wish you very good luck with it A: and I will tell you that I have retired from the painting business. A: The last time I had something done was my kitchen cabinets A: and I decided that was too much to tackle, A: I'd hire a professional. B: If you were, if you were closer I'd, I'd, I'd tell you you could come over and supervise A: Well if I were closer I might. A: Oh, well I hope your project turns out great A: and I, really think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting. A: I think that could give it a really a, B: Well, we'll see how it goes, B: I may just be flat painting over it. A: Well, of course that's the other advantage of paint. A: If you don't like it all you do is put on another coat. B: Yeah. A: I guess we'd better go because our time looks like it's about up. B: Yeah, B: I, I need to go to the dentist, B: so. A: Okay, A: bye-bye. B: It's was nice talking to you Kathleen. A: Thank you. B: Bye-bye. B: I think I get most of my news, uh, in headlines from the radio, B: and then I follow-up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention. A: Well, I, I do about the same, I guess, but in a different fashion. A: I, I, I'm from New York originally A: and now that I live in Florida, A: I live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the, in the summertime B: Uh-huh. A: and I, I feel that the, the only legitimate paper although it might sound, a little elitist is the NEW YORK TIMES. A: I've always read the NEW YORK TIMES when I was younger, A: and I try A: now that it has a national edition, I read that. A: I also read, uh, I, I, I guess I do watch, uh, MCNEIL LEHRER on P B S because I, I lean to that coverage, B: Uh-huh. A: and, and I guess I'm , B: I like them B: but they take so long. B: I don't always have time A: Yeah. A: Well, there A: , it's a whole hour show. A: Actually, it's an hour show each evening, A: and, and, we, we turn it on when we start dinner. A: We seem to start dinner around six and finish it up. B: Uh-huh. A: I find that I'm leaning on, uh, A: I travel a great deal, uh, even overseas, A: and I find that I lean on, uh, C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff. A: And, I'm, I, I'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out. A: I mean, I, I don't believe everything they say, A: but it's, it's coverage, you know. B: Yeah, B: I think C N N does a pretty good job. B: I had not watched them very much except when I was abroad, until the Gulf War. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: And they seemed to have the best coverage. B: They had more information sooner than, most of the other networks. A: Uh. A: Well, yeah, A: I, I, I, uh, A: Peter Arnet was reporting direct from, uh, Iraq. A: I think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him. B: Yeah. A: I, I think that what he, he reported what he saw B: Yeah. A: and if you didn't like it, that was just too bad, you know. B: Well, uh, I know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted, B: but I think they said that frequently enough. That, uh, you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective. A: Yeah A: , oh, yeah, A: I mean, uh. A: No. B: Uh, A: That, that's right, I think so. A: And, and I guess when it comes to, um, to magazines, I don't read, A: I used to when I was younger, A: I subscribed to TIME and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. A: I, I have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper A: or, I, I, I also subscribe to something called WORLD PRESS, which is a magazine that only talks about other, excerpts from the WORLD PRESS, B: Uh-huh. A: which sort of gives you a different slant, than, A: it's not as slanted as the NEW YORK TIMES or as biased perhaps as the local paper. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, that I guess, and the radio. A: Uh, I listen to P B S radio a lot A: and I also listen to, uh, these twenty-four hour news stations, when I'm driving. A: I, B: Yeah, B: we have a C B S twenty-four hour station that I listen to on the way to and from work A: Yeah. B: and, A: Do you read, A: are you from Southern or Northern California? B: Northern. B: I'm from, uh, the peninsula, A: So well, A: Yeah, A: is that, what is that, B: Palo Alto. A: the San Francisco paper out there is, uh, the major paper? B: Well, B: it's horrible. A: Yeah, A: and that's a terrible paper. B: The San Francisco paper is just wretched. B: So I subscribe to the SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS. A: Is that pretty good? B: Palo Alto is about midway between. B: Well it's a whole lot better than that San Francisco paper B: and, A: Oh the, what is that, the CHRONICLE isn't it? B: Yeah, B: there's the CHRONICLE, and the EXAMINER, A: Oh. B: but they're, uh, both run by the same A: Oh yeah, A: they they really are probably the worse papers I've ever read. A: I, uh, uh, B: They're just horrid A: Yeah. B: so we read, A: Well, can you get the L A paper up there? A: That's a pretty decent paper isn't it A: or, B: Uh, we can, B: but I don't like it. A: Yeah. B: So we subscribe to the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL and uh, MERCURY NEWS. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Well that's another one I read, A: I forgot that. A: I read the WALL STREET JOURNAL, A: not as in depth as I used to, because they, their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer A: but, B: Yes, B: well again, I read that, uh, two columns on the front. A: Yeah. A: I, I think I, I agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff. A: I feel pretty well versed in, in what I'm doing because I, I do spend more time on that than I do, say, on sports, or although I watch that, B: Uh-huh. A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things. A: I'm quite interested. A: I find it very exciting to, for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes B: and I think we do get pretty good coverage. B: I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the, uh, the news coverage. A: If anything, they, I think they B: We almost have too much. A: Well, I don't know, A: I, I hear a lot of criticism about listening to these, the Dan Rathers of the world and, and and taking their word for it, or their comment, A: actually, they, I think they slant things A: but, B: Well, I cannot stand Dan Rather. B: I remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston. A: No kidding! A: Oh, wow! B: And I hated him then. A: I didn't know that. A: Yeah? B: And I would not watch that man for money. A: Yeah. B: And he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach. A: Yeah, A: was, was he, B: So I watch Peter Jennings, and, uh and Tom Brokaw. Sort of alternately. A: Yeah. A: How do you feel about it? A: I guess I, I got to say, if that's the subject, if the subject is do I feel that we're well enough equipped to, A: I don't know A: if, if it said that. I feel I'm well enough equipped. B: Do we get enough news or something like that? A: Yeah. A: To, B: Do we get, uh do we get the news that we want? A: Yeah. B: And I do. B: I really think. A: Yeah, A: I think I do too. A: I think you have to let, you got to segregate some of it. B: Yeah. A: Well, that's about all I have to say B: Okay, B: well nice to talk to you. A: Nice talking to you. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Well, we, uh, A: taxes, A: everyone thinks taxes are too high I'm sure. A: But, uh, I think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases. A: What do you think? B: Uh, yeah, B: I, I think so. B: I, I'm, uh, I think I'm, I think I'm, uh, a little out of the ordinary in that, that I, I, uh, I think I'm more worried about the deficit, the national deficit than, than, uh, a lot of other people are and think that we need to, we need to either raise our taxes or, or cutback on something B: and I don't know what to cutback on to, to get, to get that, to get that settled. A: At this stage it's hard, to tell. B: And, and, uh, and, uh, I know I'm a real, a real, uh, out of it in terms of taxes B: so I'm I'm, uh, think that the, we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that, uh, for Texas B: and, and, A: Well, at this stage I think we've taxed property almost to the limit because, like the, the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home because of the cost of the taxes on them. B: Yeah. B: I think so. B: Yeah. A: I know A: I live in Richardson B: Yeah. A: and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: But now we're getting public services, the schools, the hospitals A: and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there, uh, look what the schools could cost you. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Yeah, B: now I'm, uh, uh, oh, I, B: we'd, when we moved to Richardson, one of the reasons we chose it was for the, uh, for the schools. And, and realizing that that, that, that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to, uh, to go for that, because we supported the, A: Yeah. A: Then again the, the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent, A: and the public, colleges also, the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country. B: Yeah. A: Uh, B: Yeah. A: one of the, A: uh, I believe, I don't know which one it is, uh, down there whether it's Hobby or, uh, the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition. A: Well if you double the tuition, it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states. B: Yeah, B: I think that's right. A: Yeah. A: That would provide, uh, possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things, see. B: Yeah. A: The so-called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount, A: but I eventually I think you may tax people out of smoking even. B: I, I don't, I don't know about that, B: I, I, A: Yeah A: Well, I quit ten years ago A: so I, I couldn't afford to start again B: I see. B: Okay. B: No, uh, B: Yeah, B: well, that, that, that would be true. B: That would be true. B: But, A: I know, uh, A: my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes I think. B: Huh. A: But all the various taxing authorities that come through, I think the one tax I resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime. B: Yeah, B: and, and even if it is, isn't going to, uh, uh, provide you with any, any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your, your home to a business, for instance, you know. A: Well, this, this is a thing A: I think it's like, uh, back east. A: You had to start your public transportation when you started your cities. A: You can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it. A: If we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that, and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and, uh, construction costs were cheap, you could afford it. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: But now, digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive. B: And, B: and that was pretty much it. B: And they had like three or four basic packages that they they offer. A: Yeah. A: Sounds like the Lincoln Mercury dealer I used to work for. A: They didn't order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got. A: Little Mercury Tracer B: Yeah, B: I've been B: I've been, A: imagine, or not, they make a, they make a luxury Mercury Tracer. B: Yeah, B: I've seen that in the dealership. B: I was driving a Lincoln, a Mark Seven for the last four years before I traded it for this A: Yeah. B: and, uh, I'm leasing the Lexus. B: I usually lease them since I own a business A: Yeah. B: I just run it through my business, B: but but it, A: Uh-huh. B: the Lincoln ride is certainly good, too, but the, this Lexus is nothing like I have ever been in before. *one or two utt? B: It's just, A: Like sitting in your living room. B: Yeah, B: it really is, B: and it's got a lumbar support in the seats. A: Adjustable? B: Adjustable, uh power A: Yeah B: and just kind of brings that support up in the A: tell me what you think about the Vietnam war. B: Okay. B: Well, I'm a Vietnam era veteran, B: and, uh, I was, uh, fortunate not to have to serve in the theater, B: however, my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation. Uh, B: I'm of the old school that believes that, uh, the, uh, uh, contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored. B: However, uh, I think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker. Uh, B: but those are my personal thoughts, B: and I think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people. B: But as it was, the politicians ran the, the Korean conflict and ultimately the Vietnam thing, B: and we managed to come out, uh, losers all the way around. B: And so this is what ultimately triggered us, uh, United States, uh, per se, being, uh, deciding to get out of the role of world policeman. B: Your views, A: Uh, as I understand it, and I, uh, don't know a lot about it, uh, we got in there because of France B: Well. A: uh, France was there first. A: They had, B: We got into it because of SEATO agreement, back just right after World War Two that, uh, we pledged a mutual, uh, uh, defense of, of the South Vietnamese, B: and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another, B: and really we B: I, I question us, you know, now, B: of course hindsight is all too clear. A: Sure. B: Uh, so, we're, we, we have to, have to deal with, with the, uh, situation as, as we played it. A: Jerry, what did you think of people like, uh, Jane Fonda, another war anti-war activist. B: I, B: don't get me started on those people. B: You know, before she, before Jane Fonda did, did what she did, I thought she was a wonderful person, B: but after, uh, uh, well, B: I, I just don't have anything, want anything to do with her any more, B: because you support, uh, you support your government. A: Right or wrong? B: Uh, okay, B: right or wrong, B: I don't think is, is, we can determine whether we were right or wrong, B: because, you're, you're having to deal with, again, uh, B: I think we could have made a different agreement back in the the late forties era that would have kept of there. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh, you know, I, I didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that. A: I thought we came in as first advisors to the French, and then they decided to pull out A: and, B: Can you hold just a second, Terry? A: Sure. B: One moment please. A: Sure to someone else or A: Wonder what happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something. A: Huh, fascinating. A: Well that's not, B: Sorry for the delay. A: That's okay. B: Uh, yeah, B: this is, B: the, uh, the, the, uh, mutual defense thing was, uh, B: we, we, B: it was complicated, B: and I don't think everybody knows the whole situation. B: I don't. B: But from what I can gather, is we went and said yeah, we will help the South Vietnamese, uh, should they ask. B: Well, the French went in and tried their old style warfare, and, uh, got soundly thrashed. B: And we didn't do a whole lot better. A: Um. No, A: I had thought that they had, uh, colonies there, or something. B: Well, yeah, B: that was the old French colony, but see, the French, the French were our, uh, allies in NATO A: Right. B: and they're also our allies in SEATO, which was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which has since been, uh, disbanded as far as I know, B: you know, NATO is, is on the way of being disbanded. Uh, B: but, uh, the, you know, the French, yeah B: we go in as an ally to the French and says yeah, we'll, we'll help you out, if you get in a bind. B: Well, they got in a bind and says we don't want to, you know, play any more A: Uh-huh. B: so, uh, we, we kind of, we kind of got, got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly uh, um, oh, operations and then the full scale, you know, full scale troops, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. A: Yeah, A: I'm thirty-two, A: so, uh, I A: well, I missed it. A: Seventy-four is when they quit sending troops. B: Uh, yeah, B: yeah B: roughly. A: Yeah. A: I was just probably three or four years, A: Okay, uh, A: what kind of hobbies do you have Lori? B: Uh, I guess, I, uh, I like to play golf. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, I also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts. A: Uh-huh. A: Where do you play golf in this area? B: Well, we live, uh, pretty close, to the Mesquite Golf Course. A: Uh-huh. B: So, we will play either out there or at Firewheel. B: That is usually where we play, B: but I have played you know different courses in in the Dallas area. A: Do you, uh, do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf? B: Uh, both A: Oh. B: Not at the same time. A: I was going to say, that could be difficult B: No, sometimes we ride B: and sometimes, uh, we, pull, B: we like to, to, uh, a lot of the times just walk, uh, for the exercise. B: But A: Uh-huh. B: I find that when I ride in a cart, I play better B: and I think it is cause I don't get as tired A: I think that might be true. B: Yeah. A: I don't like pulling a cart on Firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path. B: I know, B: and that makes me so mad B: You know, it is like it is not going to do that much damage to the course, but apparently they think differently A: That is the reason, I don't play over there. B: Yeah. A: I like the course, but I don't play over there because, you, they don't, uh, you know don't allow you to pull a cart. B: Right. A: And, I don't think a cart damages the turf. B: Right. B: Well, the reason why we play over there is because its where, since we are a Garland resident, they gave us a special deal where you can get, uh, ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars, B: yeah, B: a hundred dollars B: cause it is half price what the normal green fees are. A: Uh-huh. B: So that is why we you know play over there B: cause we have got our card A: Well, I guess I could use a card too. A: I live, uh, very near, uh, very close to the Firewheel Golf Course. B: Oh, do you? B: So you live in Garland then. A: Yes, A: I live in northwest Garland. A: Right up there near the golf course. B: Okay, B: well we are in south Garland, B: but yeah, next time you go, uh, you know, check into it, B: they have, uh, B: it is just like, uh, a bus card B: and they just punch it. You know, B: it has got one through ten on it B: and every time you go they just punch it for you. A: Well, in the last two years, I have not played very much golf because I am involved in Boy Scouts. B: Oh, okay. A: So, I have, uh, I have, uh, I have children Boy Scout age. B: You must have a, a son. A: I have two boys that are boy scout age, A: and, uh, so I am very active in Boy Scouts B: Oh, okay. A: so I would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby. B: Yeah. A: But I B: Oh well that sounds like fun too A: but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get to use them again A: because my boys are still right at the beginning age A: and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, you need to, uh, teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you A: That's right. A: Lessons are expensive though. B: Oh, yeah. B: Well you can teach them A: Well, they would probably never make it then A: because I don't think, uh, A: I only took lessons for golf when I was in college. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, as a course for P E you know so I could graduate. B: Right, B: Right. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, that is the only time I think I have ever really taken golf lessons A: and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. B: Right. A: I took one lesson one other time. A: Besides that, uh, I just, uh, try to make the club hit the ball. B: Right. B: Yeah, B: I know what you mean A: I don't want to play strike out, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: But I have fun doing it, A: some, uh, you know, I have some good shots and some bad shots. B: Oh yeah. B: It, it is just nice to get outdoors and do something. A: So you said you work, uh, in the gardens too. A: Do you have, uh, a special flowers? B: Well flower gardens. B: I like to have, B: matter of fact this past weekend I just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs. B: So, those ought to be coming up around spring time A: My wife had, uh, just put in a bunch of, I want to say, they are pansies. B: Uh-huh. A: She put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants. B: Right. A: And they have been, A: we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine. B: Oh, they do great. B: I put mine in probably in November. A: That is when she did, I think. B: Yeah, B: I think it was November B: and I don't do anything to mine, water them or anything B: And they just, B: they do really good B: and I even had, uh, I guess it was last year or the year before, I had some out B: and it froze B: and the pansies looked terrible, but they came back later. B: I didn't do anything to them B: so they are, uh, they are good to plant in the winter time. B: They last for a long time then. B: So, if you start putting them, you know, you can put them out in the spring too, B: but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather. A: Uh-huh. A: Do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time? A: Will they make it through the summer sun? B: No, B: they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot, B: but they make it through probably winter and spring. B: So, A: Well. B: Yeah, B: I have got some of those too, B: cause I love flowers A: Well, that is good. B: Yeah. B: And I do, I try to do some arts and crafts B: and I love to go, A: So you have a child Uh-huh. B: Yeah B: we, B: Two year old daughter in child care B: and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh, finding what we consider to be, real good child care at a, uh, pretty reasonable price, we think. A: Uh, B: How about you, B: do you have any children? A: Yes, A: our first A: and he just turned three months. B: Oh, boy. A: So, we're just starting into hunting for child care. B: Yeah. A: Right now, both of us are students. B: Are you? B: Where are a student? A: Uh, A: Uh, University of Southern Mississippi. B: No kidding. A: Uh, she's, B: I was a professor in a university here in California for a while. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: uh, are you going to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two? A: Uh, probably. Uh, A: actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care uh, five days a week more than likely. Uh, depending on how my class schedule runs B: Yeah. A: because my wife will be doing her internship that semester. B: Uh-huh. A: It will be forty hour week, not, no, eight to five type of thing. B: Yeah. A: So depending on what my class schedule looks like, he may spend four, anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point. A: Right now we're trying to avoid it, A: but we just, as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a, a girl to, uh, watch him. A: Uh, I get out of class at certain time A: and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. You know, A: once a day this overlap happens where we can't, one of us be home. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: So for about twenty twenty, thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in. B: Well, that's a good experience, I think, B: and, uh, there are a lot of things to think about B: and the articles that are written on the topic, are pretty good B: and they kind of boil down to, uh, B: any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative A: Uh-huh B: and what we found, uh, to be the best guide was our own instincts about, people who were going to be loving A: Yeah. B: and, uh, that's more important than anything else. B: We could have sent, uh, her to a fancier, uh, facility. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, she goes to a home. B: This is a, uh, a couple, uh, emigrated from China early in, in their lives. A: Uh-huh. B: They've been here probably thirty, forty years. A: Yeah. B: They've got three daughters. B: Uh, and, they have a loving home B: and, uh, they're both there B: and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon. A: Uh-huh. B: And our daughter is healthy, happy, well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends, A: Yeah. B: so it's a good experience. A: Uh, that makes a big difference. B: I B: if it's good, B: I think it's very good for the child. A: Yes. B: And if it's, a loving environment, I think it's very good B: and, and that's really what we've learned about it. B: She'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year A: Yeah. B: but, uh, we feel real fortunate B: and we were able to, uh, just, uh, choose in the marketplace. B: I don't know what it's like around, uh, Hattiesburg. A: There's a lot of child care available, but invariably there's waiting lists. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: And we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the, uh, okay, the university, uh, university's, uh uh, department of, uh, uh, their Home Ec Department B: Yeah. B: I'll bet they're involved. B: Yeah. A: uh, they, uh, they have a subbranch, uh, American Family Counseling A: and their people staff this, this, uh, the child care center just off campus. A: But, uh, they have a pretty good size waiting list. B: Yeah A: So, B: Well, that's, uh, B: I know it's, it's a real hard thing to do, even for people in, in, uh, university communities. A: Uh-huh. B: Out here at Manford, they have a, you know, a, a, a real good facility B: and there, uh, is quite a waiting list to get into that. A: Yeah. B: So it's, uh, uh, you know, it's a, it's a, it's an important, decision, B: it's an industry that's still a cottage industry A: Yeah. Yeah, B: and I think this is really is buyer beware. Well, it is the best way to do it, interestingly. A: a cottage industry's the best way to do it really, A: because if you over, B: I think that, uh, my own interest in, in development, human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that, uh, private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: Because, I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market. B: As a matter of fact, my future is banked on that, uh, professionally because I believe that, that there are, uh, pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet by schools, colleges universities for, uh, learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care. A: Uh-huh. B: Primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life. A: Yes. A: And it's amazing how much good things like, uh, Sesame Street will do. B: It's, it's phenomenal. B: It's phenomenal, the programming, the human operating system, A: favorite type of music or musician or any. B: I don't really have a favorite type. B: I like, uh, a lot of different types of music. A: Do you? B: Yeah, B: I have a, a tape collection that I like to listen to, uh, cassette tapes A: Uh-huh. B: but it's pretty varied. A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: How about you? A: Oh, I, I'm very, uh, I'm very varied as well. A: I, uh, I don't think I've ever met a type of music I don't like except for, uh, maybe, you know, heavy metal and that. B: That's exactly me. B: The acid rock or the heavy metal. A: Yeah. B: Even some of that I like okay but not, mostly, as a general rule, A: Yeah. B: I don't care for that at all. A: Yeah. A: I don't enjoy rap too much, either. A: That, that doesn't appeal to, uh, my ears. B: Well, as far as the rap goes, I think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and I like some of their songs. A: Oh. B: But as, as B: I agree, with the general rule, I, I wouldn't choose rap either. A: Uh-huh. B: But I, I like to listen to, uh, what you might call pop, easy listening country western, jazz uh, classical, um, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: I, I don't, B: I like, uh, like I said, pretty varied, uh, music. A: Uh-huh. B: I have a couple that my husband really hates that I listen to, like Billy Holiday A: Oh B: I really love to listen to her, A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, I even have a, a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo A: Oh, gosh. B: and, well, I mean, they're very harmonic A: Uh-huh B: they really are. A: uh-huh, A: yeah, A: sure. B: So, they're interesting to listen to. B: You might try that. B: How about you? A: Well, um, I listen to, uh, specific, A: most, most likely I would be listen to, uh, jazz or classical music. A: Um I, in college I took, uh, four years of classical guitar, A: and I played in the, in the jazz combo all four years. A: I play guitar for the jazz combo. B: Oh, yeah? A: So, uh, that's where my two, my two listening enjoyments are, A: but, you know, jazz can get on my nerves after a while. A: Uh, you can't just listen to it, you know, to, uh, especially a lot of the deeper stuff, Yeah, unless, unless you're playing it, *sv B: It's too, um, uh, B: you have to concentrate on it, it seems. A: it just, it just doesn't do anything. B: What about the blues or something like that? A: Uh, uh, blues are okay. A: I, I tell you, I do like, um, A: I grew up on blue grass music. A: My dad is a big blue grass fan, A: and so B: Uh-huh. A: um, I wouldn't have admitted it when I was in high school A: but, I really do like it a lot. A: So. B: I, I like some of it, um, B: as far as like the what they now call country western, it doesn't sound like the old country music at all, does it? *two utts?? A: No, A: it doesn't, A: it doesn't. B: Um, some of it sounds more like pop music. A: Yeah, A: uh they've all got, you know, the real screechy electric guitars now. B: Oh, B: yeah, If I'm going to listen to today's country western, I have tapes of like Randy Travis and Clint Black A: Yeah. B: and I even liked Jim Reeves you know A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I, I, A: yeah, Uh-huh. B: or, uh, what, what Merle Haggard and Faron Young A: Uh-huh. B: that type of country western is what I, I like to listen to. Uh, Sons of the Pioneers, you know, stuff like that. *all caps for titles A: Sure. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Um, oh, I like sound tracks a lot. A: Oh, do you? B: Yeah, B: it seems like you get a lot of original music that way. A: Yeah, A: you sure do. B: I mean, you know, think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that that's just real recent A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: things like that I like to listen to. B: Um, I like instrumental things. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, I have some Spiro Gyro tapes. A: Oh, they're great aren't they. B: Oh, they're wonderful. A: Yeah. B: I love them. B: I have some dulcimer music. B: I mean, like I said, that, that's pretty varied. A: Yeah, A: it sure is, A: yeah. B: Al Jarreau, he's somebody I like. B: He's pretty, kind of jazz inspired but but still kind of pop, too. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I like his, A: he has a nice smooth voice. B: Oh, yeah, B: and, you know, what I like the most about him, is, I've gone to see him in concert, and he always, he looks like he's having fun. A: Yeah, A: sure. B: I mean, some people sing, B: and they have their faced all contorted, like it hurts them or something B: But he looks like he's having a good time. B: I mean, he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and, and like all he wants to do is, is make the audience enjoy it, too. A: Uh-huh. A: Sure. B: And he, he is real fun to listen to. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, Bonnie Rait, I like her a lot. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, in fact, whenever she won her big Grammy A: Uh-huh. B: I think it was like five of them or something A: Uh-huh. B: was, was it five, B: or. A: Yeah, A: something like that, A: it was last, last, last year wasn't it. B: Yeah, B: last year or the year before, I can't remember, B: but, um, I was listening to a particular radio station B: and, and the one D J said, who the heck is Bonnie Rait and why does she deserve five Grammies? B: Well, I vowed then that I was not going to listen to that radio station any more, if that D J can make such a A: Okay. B: Okay, B: well, Mark, our situation is that we do have a daughter that is, uh, in the situation of choosing college. A: Uh-huh. B: She's actually at Bible College for this current year. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, I guess uh, first and foremost, it, really it's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then, uh, uh, which colleges or universities can best offer that program, B: and then it comes down to the dollar. B: You have to, uh, B: it's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction, you know, it does, *sv A: Uh-huh. B: it comes down to, uh trying to come with a trade off of the costs. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, what do you feel about come of the things that need to, A: Damn it , I agree with pretty much with everything you've said. A: Uh, the one, the one thing that I, you know, I'd advise any parent, uh, you know, or any, or any person looking for a college, uh, is that I think, I think, you know, it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from, you know, the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the, you know, actual students there A: because, you know, they're just, uh, in my experience, A: I've talked to people at other colleges, uh, that, you know, A: the, the, the way, the, you know, the, the, the lifestyle pictured in the catalogs isn't always the whole story. B: No, B: the, the college, B: the, the catalogs are sales material. A: Uh-huh. B: It doesn't matter whether, you know, they're, they're selling school. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, and, true, B: it, uh, really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I guess there's a difference in, B: here the, B: at least, the university here in Saskatoon is primarily, uh, off campus resident students. B: Like, they just live in the community. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, you know, I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities, particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is, uh, is right on campus as well A: Uh-huh. B: and that, you know, that changes the character of it quite a bit. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I, I go to Georgia Tech which is, you know, primarily an engineering school B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, you know, I think I really do miss the fact, you know, that it's not a university, that there's, there's not, the, the, you know, A: it tends to be a very conservative school A: and there, and there doesn't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of, you know, universities will, will have. B: Yeah. B: Uh, I guess we're here, B: this is the university that has, for years had the, the car, that, uh, will travel the farthest on, uh, on a small quantity of gas, *utt 3 & 4 one utt?? B: our engineering students. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, in competitions B: and that's the kind of thing that also you see, uh, if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, whether you, you know, in one sense, whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a, a spirit of, somewhat unkind, but producing graduates. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Uh, you know, as sort of some development and some training, uh, B: like it's easy enough to crank out graduates, but to really challenge them A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, and that can vary between colleges, and faculties even, as to how, you know, what the attitude towards achievement is. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, do you, uh, have anyone that you're seriously needing to, uh, feed information to? B: I suppose if you're actually at Georgia Tech as a student, you're a ways away from that. A: Yeah, A: uh, I don't really know of anyone that's like that's looking for colleges now, you know, because it, with the exception of, uh, people's younger brothers and sisters. A: Then the only advise passed down is, don't go to Georgia Tech A: Uh, but, uh, no, A: actually I'm, I'm, I'm more interested in, in, in choosing the right job when you graduate type information B: Right. B: Well, that's, that's one of the, really, a valid point that people need to consider as well. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, you know, to, B: going to college, university is going to take four to eight years depending on the programs person's involved in A: Program. B: and after that, you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself A: Uh-huh. B: and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market A: Uh-uh. B: jeez, B: if that's, A: Uh-huh, A: like a fine arts education, A: I, B: Right. B: Best training in the world is not going to put food on your table. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, A: You have any pets? B: Do I have pets? A: Yeah. B: Yes, B: I have a cat B: and I have two dogs. A: Two dogs, A: what kind? B: I have a Schnauzer B: and I have a Sheltie. A: Schnauzers. A: Is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer? B: It, it's a miniature. A: Uh. I'm going into all this because I used to I just got done working at a pet shop actually. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, okay. A: Yeah. B: Well, the Schnauzer I'm, I'm watching for one of, uh, the managers where I work B: and he's been transferred to Germany for a while A: Uh. B: and I'm taking care of his dog B: and, uh, and I had just got the kitten when he asked me that B: and he says, well, my dog doesn't like cats, B: and I said, well, we won't tell him it's a we won't tell her it's a cat, because it was a kitten, B: and, you know, they just, they just love kittens. A: Yeah. B: They just are fascinated. A: Oh, yeah. B: So she doesn't know that this is a cat yet. A: That's good. A: They say , B: And they get along real good. B: I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty, he'd flip. *listen B: So that was interesting. A: Didn't expect that would happen. A: Yeah, A: that's cool, A: that's nice. A: Uh, let's see, A: what was the other dog you had? B: It's a sheltie. A: Oh, a sheltie. B: She's real sweet little dog. B: She's got a very nice temperament. B: Uh, they're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer. A: Yeah. B: You know, the Schnauzers are a little aggressive. A: They can be nippy. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: shelties are nice. A: Everybody seems to be really happy with them. A: They're good temperament. B: They're a good temperament A: They put up with a lot. B: and they, and they just, uh, B: they, B: I think they have a good head on their shoulders. B: I think they have a, a higher level of intelligence than other, uh, dogs that I have encountered. A: Schnauzers, in particular probably. B: Well, yeah, B: but also some poodles, uh A: Oh, yeah. B: they're kind of, B: there are some smart ones out there, B: but there's some also some, uh, not so smart ones A: Yeah, A: I A: it seems the smaller the are, the, the worse off they are B: Yeah, B: that's, that's, maybe that's, there's, uh, some credence in that statement. A: Yeah, A: they're bred down so much. A: It's, B: Uh-huh. A: They aren't the best pets. B: I, I'd, I really don't know what the best pet is. A: Yeah. B: I guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal. And bull dogs A: Yeah, A: I mean, some people seem fairly well suited for for, uh, miniature poodles and such. B: But I don't know about these, uh, these, uh, uh, these pincers, these, now, what are they called. Pit bulls, pit bulls that are so vicious. A: Pit bull. A: They might, A: they're actually very friendly dogs. B: Are they really? B: I don't think I've ever seen one. A: Uh, they're really nice. A: I, I've dealt with quite a few of them. A: People, uh, customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like, they, uh, fit collars and stuff on them A: and they are, they are just really nice, really friendly, uh, kind of like medium intelligence. Uh, B: Well, how do they become B: how did they get their reputation, then? A: Well, because some people, uh, want to train them as, B: Oh, they train them to be that way, then. A: Yeah. B: Oh, okay. A: You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way. B: Oh, okay. A: Yeah, A: it takes a lot of training and a early edition for the coupons, you know, the Sunday edition. B: So. A: Yeah. B: But, then I just, you know, bundle it up and put it on the front, you know, the front walk you know, every Monday or every other Monday, and have them pick that up, A: Yeah. B: but that's the extent of what I've done. B: I'd like to be able to do more. B: The problem is, with a lot of it is, you have to go, you know, it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it, you know A: Yeah A: see, and, B: it's not always convenient to do it. A: Yeah, A: see, and here in Lubbock everything's so close. A: I can imagine what it's like up there. B: Yeah, B: I'm not exactly sure where the, you know, the can thing is, B: but, you know, sometimes it's just so, B: seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash, and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them. A: Yeah. A: See, I went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago, as a matter of fact, and got me one of those little can crushers that I could put on the wall B: Uh-huh. A: and then I put me a little five gallon bucket, A: and it's just outside the garage door B: Uh-huh. A: so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket. B: Do those can crushers work good? A: Yeah, A: I got one from Payless Cashways, A: and it's actually metal B: Uh-huh. A: it's not plastic. A: I didn't want to buy a plastic one. B: Yeah B: because those things I think would just snap you know. A: Yeah. A: But Payless Cashways has them A: and they're metal, A: and I don't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there, A: but it was only like seven dollars, not too bad. B: Oh. B: I'd have to check into something like that, because, I mean, we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here, you know, B: but, um you know, occasionally we have some around, A: Yeah. B: but, you know, for other kind of cans, just to, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they. A: Yeah, A: I don't, A: yeah, A: I don't think it would crush steel cans, A: it's pretty tough. B: Yeah, B: so. I don't know, B: I don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that, B: but, I need to look into it more, A: No, A: you could probably just, you know, B: you know, it's, you know, it, B: sometimes, even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper, you know, B: they won't take paper that's shiny, A: Yeah A: they won't, yeah, they won't take any lint free paper A: or, see, I work at T I. B: Yeah, B: so does my husband, B: yeah. A: We do a lot of recycling out there. B: Uh-huh. A: Now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard, A: but that's just now come on board. B: Uh-huh. A: You know, we've been throwing paper out there away for years, A: and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out, you know. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I don't know what, B: you know, I haven't, B: I'm sure they're probably doing that here some. A: Yeah, A: I'm sure they are. A: T I is doing it pretty well nation-wide, I'm sure. B: Uh-huh. B: I think it's necessary, B: I, I like it, B: you know, it makes, B: I think it's good that you see these, you know, like boxes, cereal, B: they're now starting to make them, you know, the packages out of recycled paper, B: and, And I've bought, you know, I've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper, A: Oh, yeah. B: and I think they're just fine. A: Yeah, A: I bought a, A: I got one at work that I bought for one of the guys there at work, A: it's his birthday, A: we're pretty good friends, A: and what it is is a recycled paper bag B: Uh-huh. A: and it's just got Happy Birthday printing on it, and a cute little phrase inside, A: and it's just a paper bag B: Uh-huh. A: you know, and it's really cute. B: Yeah. A: But, I think we're doing better and better all the time, B: Yeah A: still don't, B: I think we're getting, becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more. B: So. A: No, A: there's not going to be any room, shortly. B: No, B: no, B: the office, A: I don't know what New York does about theirs. A: I guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere. B: Yeah, B: it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere A: Yeah, A: so. But I think we're getting better at it B: Yeah. A: I think there's quite a bit more we could do. B: to someone in the Girls, put that away. B: Now. A: But, you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth. B: Yeah, B: I just wish it was a little more convenient to do, A: Yeah. B: you know, seems like you're so busy anyway, B: and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about. B: So. A: Yeah, A: it sure is. B: I think if, you know, the cities, locally, you know, they'd get more programs going so that you could do that, it'd make it a lot easier. B: So. A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: Well, they'll get at it sooner. A: I guess the schools will get into it, too, sooner or later. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: get the kids interested in it too. A: You know they have, A: We tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that I have, A: and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans. B: Yeah. A: You know, if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people, sure they'll save them for us, there's no problem there. B: Uh-huh. A: But what do you do with them in the meantime? B: That's right. A: Now I don't want a can, a garage full of cans B: That's right, B: who does. B: You know people don't have room for that kind of stuff. A: You know. A: No, A: they're just not, they're not prepared for it. B: No, B: and in Texas, they're just get, things like that, B: they just get bugs in them. B: So. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: they do. B: So, you don't, A: You know, the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get, A: that's for sure. B: That's right, B: so. A: So. B: I'm pretty lazy about it right now. B: Everything goes into one thing and goes out to the A: Yeah. B: You know, pick it up. B: So. A: Yeah, A: myself. A: About the only thing I really recycle around here is aluminum cans. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: Well, I need to get, get better at it. B: So. A: Well, if we all try a little bit, a little bit goes a long way. B: Yeah, B: that's right, B: that's right. A: If everybody tries to do just a little bit, and a little bit more then we'll get there. B: That's true. B: That's right. A: Well thank you for talking to me. B: Huh. B: Well, thank you for calling. B: I, A: Sure, A: no problem, B: Okay, B: take care. A: All right, B: Bye-bye. A: Bye-bye. A: I, I, I, assume you have kids in B: Uh, we have one. B: She's only nine months old. A: Oh, well she, she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet. B: Right. B: Well, my degree is in teaching, B: so. A: Yeah. A: Well, we have a little bit of a basis for conversation. A: I was a substitute teacher for about a year. B: Oh, really. A: Yeah. A: I, uh, thought I wanted to be a teacher A: so, but before I went through all of that I wanted to see how I was going to like it. B: Uh-huh. A: And, and they, uh, A: in Alabama, where I came from they, they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree. A: So I went out and played substitute for a while and decided, nope, not for me. B: Did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels B: or, A: Yeah. A: It was, A: I just took grades one through six. B: Uh-huh. A: I thought I was going to be smart and get the good kids, wrong. B: Well, my degree was in fourth through seventh grade B: but I taught junior high. B: And I expected it to be a lot of trouble B: but it wasn't that bad, B: I taught remedial reading kids. A: Um. B: And, well, they don't call it remedial reading these days, they call it something else. A: Yeah. B: But, but, anyway, at the time that's what I taught. B: And, um, you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way, when you have your slow readers A: Uh-huh and clicking noises in B: but it, it wasn't too bad. B: We, we got long real well. A: Well, I, I sometimes wonder if I didn't mess up. A: I maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can, if you have to you can get mean with them. A: Those little kids don't understand it. B: Yeah. B: I, B: especially with the real young ones. B: I started out wanting to teach lower, like primary and then top primary and thought, well, no, I don't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth B: and so that's what I got my certification in. A: Uh-huh. B: But I had decided long before I was even married that I wanted to, if possible, teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools. A: Yeah. B: Um, and my reason for that was I don't like the, uh, what's the right word. The varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools. A: Well, that's a nice way of putting it. B: You can find a lot of good public schools if you, if you look real hard B: but I don't think they could cover everything that you could teach, your children on an individual basis. A: exactly, A: And too, most people don't have that option. B: Yeah. A: You know. And plus it also depends on the district your in as, I mean, on the, A: I've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do. Uh, accept for the private ones, of course, we're talking about public. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: I don't know A: Back when I was going to school uh, you just didn't get away with the things these kids get away with now. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean you, you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and, uh, usually bending over to get five of the best, B: Yeah A: Um, but now, nowadays they can't even, they can barely scold the children for something, you know, without getting sued. B: And the, the, um, the crime is just escalated and the drugs and, even in the, in the the, the lower, the lower schools. A: Oh, yeah. A: Well, the thing that really did it for me, I was subbing in a fifth grade class A: and, uh, this kid comes to school with his lunch box A: and inside this lunch box he, he's got easily two, I'd say two hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills. B: Um. A: And I asked him, uh, what are you doing with that? A: And he says, "My father gave it to me." A: And I didn't believe it for a minute. B: Uh-huh A: Um, so, uh, but, uh, you know, the, A: not a lot I could do about it. B: Right. A: Can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants. B: Crazy for him to B: but, A: Well, I have, A: I, I, I've A: I think I understood what the, what the kid was doing he was a, uh, A: well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: But not a lot I could do about it. B: Well, we had the problem when I was in, B: with teaching, um, B: I was eighth and ninth graders that I worked with B: and if we did have a, a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there. A: Uh-huh. B: And you don't know if you were reaching them or not B: but we felt like, you know, maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was trying to teach them was better than have them taken out. A: Yeah. A: Because, uh, uh, that just, A: that doesn't do a lot for them. A: I mean it, alleviates your problem B: Yeah. A: but it doesn't do anything for them. B: Right. B: Uh, most the time if they were, they were, B: some of them were even better behaved. B: I've only had two instances where I it was really noticeable B: but they were better behaved when they were, um, B: I don't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on B: but it ended up better B: but, A: Uh, I don't know, A: guns and, A: I don't know A: it's something. B: I think there's a problem too with teachers trying to, um, to be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics, you know, B: they've been a big drive in, especially in the seventies to return back to the basics. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, and I'm not completely just, you know, just teach the basics in schools B: but I think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because, of our, our lower grades in the standardized test and such. A: Oh, yeah. A: Oh, sure. A: I mean, it's indicative across the board that we, we've done something wrong. B: Right. A: And when you see, uh, Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the, uh, science jobs, all the engineering jobs, all the mathematical jobs A: and, you know, here we are A: we can't, we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, I don't know. B: Well, I spent a year and a half in Japan also B: and I've seen how their school system works B: and I, B: they go by a complete rote system, B: you just memorize everything. A: Uh-huh. B: And then at the end of the, of a certain time period you spitted everything back out B: and the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be. A: Yeah. B: So I don't completely agree with that either. A: No. B: But there, there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere. A: Yeah. A: That's, that's a great deal what law school's like B: Oh, is it? A: Yeah. B: Is that what you ended up going into? A: Yeah. B: Oh. A: And, uh, I did the same sort of thing, A: they just, A: you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases A: and then you get one examine for the whole semester B: Uh-huh. A: and it's how well you can remember it all. B: How, how much can you stuff in your brain. A: Yeah. A: And I found that a particularly useless way of studying. B: Yeah. A: I never did. A: I always tried to understand things, not tried to memorize. B: Uh-huh. A: And consequently some of the very best students were, had excellent memories A: but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned. B: Yeah. A: So, B: Yeah. A: It didn't show me anything. A: A year and a half, I gave it up. A: I wasn't really A: I didn't want to be a lawyer anyway, just wanted the degree. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: So, B: Yeah. A: Well, B: Well, A: I don't know. A: What can we do about it? B: good question B: Probably, A: Money, Money is not the answer. B: Taking, B: No. B: There's plenty of money in the system, A: Yeah. B: it's just, A: Yeah. A: I mean, they're throwing more money at it now than ever before A: and things are getting worse. B: I think it's like a lot of things in the, in the United States. B: We've got so much built up in, um, in the, in the, uh, bureaucracy and in the politics of it, A: Uh-huh. B: and in the, the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again B: and there's no way that, that can be done. A: Uh-huh. B: Not without wiping out a whole generation of, of kids in the school system, A: Yeah. B: so. A: Yeah. B: Maybe on smaller, smaller scales. A: Well, I don't know A: I, uh, A: as much as I didn't like school when I was going through it, from my perspective now I can see that it's a lot better than what we have now. B: Uh-huh. A: And I think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school. B: Yeah. A: You know, I mean, it's, it's silly that these, that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline. B: Uh-huh. B: Right into the classroom it needs to be be able to be enforced. A: Yeah. A: Exactly, A: I mean, I, I mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something, to students because they're going get, they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something. B: Uh-huh. B: It's like doctors in lawsuits, A: Oh yeah. B: you know, they're kind of fearful of, everything. A: Well, lawyers help create that B: That's, that's, B: well, at least I've heard that B: I, I, I haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's, been applicable to me A: Well, I think, I think, I, I mean what we've turned the school schools into now are just day-care centers A: you know, somebody, A: okay, A: we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day A: and he's out of our hair. B: Right. A: And the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents. B: Uh-huh. A: You know, they're just, B: Oh, yeah B: it has to be reinforced in the home. A: Oh, sure. A: I, I A: you, you can, you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything at home then it's, it's not going to help either. B: Yeah. B: Right. A: So, I don't know, A: I don't know, A: I don't know what the answer is. B: Uh-huh. A: It's an interesting, interesting thing you want to do. A: I, A: how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools, A: do they allow it? B: Yeah. B: They allow it under certain circumstances. B: You have to, to prove that you're teaching them something. B: You have to follow, a preferred curriculum, A: Uh-huh. B: um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to. A: Uh-huh. B: And then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be, they're kind of monitored. B: You know, they, they will allow you to, B: I can't think of any examples B: but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence. B: And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think they're were in this area B: but, um, they, they are monitored by the, um, by the State School Board. A: Um. B: So. A: That's interesting. A: I remembering reading a few cases about that when it, when some people first tried that and they got sued. Got taken to court by the school system. B: Uh-huh. A: I'm glad the parents won. A: I mean, it seems silly that, um, we started A: that's, that's the way you got your education in this country. B: Uh-huh. A: And then, um, A: I don't know. A: I grew up, uh, in the, the sixties, A: and at that time, uh, it was is a changing time for the whole music scene, I guess A: and I grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it I guess for several years after I graduated from college and, and thereafter A: but have since, uh, A: I grew up in a small town in, in southern Oklahoma A: I have kind of gone back to, uh, more of a county, uh, flavor in music. A: Um, I'm not quite sure why that is A: and it seems like almost a opposite, A: but I guess I got away from what I consider to be the pot, uh, sounding music. A: It didn't have what, you know, I guess what I was looking for at the time country tells more of a, a story. A: It kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up A: and I've, I've become I guess more of a country fan over the years. B: When you say that you grew up, uh, in the sixties I take it that was the, uh, teenage type years B: or, uh, A: Yeah, A: that was my teenage years. A: I was born in fifty A: and, and, uh, B: Okay, B: we, we're very similarly aged, B: so we probably have an interesting perspective on the music on the times, B: so I'm just a couple years older than you, A: Yeah. B: um, essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that I, for one reason or another I didn't pay much attention to music, B: but as I look back now I realize it was very formative for me, B: uh, my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel, whom I saw perform when I was in college B: and I became attached to that style of, uh, urban, urban country if there is such a thing, A: Yeah. B: I think with, in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend, uh, to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, uh, usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it. B: Uh, over time I became very interested in, in baroque classical B: and I think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found it, it very relaxing for me. B: My tastes now run I guess to a upbeat, uh, Simon, A: Yeah. B: it's something that interests me, uh, combined with, with the classical tastes I had mentioned. B: And my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds, early eighteen hundred music. B: I'm not a music, um, B: , I'm not particularly schooled in it. B: I know what I like to listen to as far as classical music. B: And I, I spent a good deal of time listening also to, uh, people from the late seventies, really, um, Neil Diamond, for instance. Um, people of, of that particular time, A: That's kind of the way I am. A: Uh-huh. B: I listen to some country and western B: but I'm not schooled in it B: and I, I've enjoyed the times when I have listened to it. B: I played a little bit of piano. B: I continue to do that. B: I want to do it B: and I never have the discipline to stay with it, B: but when I do play, uh, and begin to reacquire skills I inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a, for a new piano player. A: It is, it's got, uh, basically an easy, uh, rhythm and, and tone. B: Right. A: And it's, it's pretty, fairly well easily to uh, uh, something to fall into. A: I'm kind of the say way, A: I, I've gone through different periods of life, uh, in music from pop to classical. A: I guess one of the things was that influenced me was that I, I've worked in radio stations as a D J for all my college years trying to support my way through there, A: and A: was support, A: I was influenced by all different kinds of music A: but basically because that's where I worked. A: And I've developed a real love for, uh, classical music in, probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, uh, heavy into classical type music. A: He said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music, uh, that they were using behind them because they used, especially Disney used a lot of classical music, uh, behind the cartoons A: and so consequently we wind up, wound up playing a lot of classical music there A: and I think that, uh, got deep seated into me. A: One of things I especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is, uh, are those that call on those classical, uh, roots, I guess, uh, Barry Manilow comes to mind for some reason there's, there's not a whole lot of his stuff that I'm real crazy about, A: but he does have some things. A: Chicago had some things, B: Right. A: uh, and I think even Electric Light Orchestra had some, some real, um, influences by classical music A: and I'm still, still, A: my favorite, A: in fact most of my C D are classical music. B: I find it very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy I particularly like the music. B: I don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation. B: Uh, a good example would be, uh, B: I have connections but, but not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations, A: Uh-huh. B: uh, and I found that I really like CHINA BEACH B: and I particularly like TOUR OF DUTY B: and both of them, I had as much fascination of the background music, I think going on as I did to the theme of the shows, A: Yeah. B: uh, and I, I've, uh, THIRTY SOMETHING I'm particularly interested, B: but it's the music, almost that I find myself listening to, uh, A: Yeah. A: I'm kind of thinking that's maybe, A: our generation was, uh, so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with, uh, things now with the music that's behinds them. B: That could well be. B: I, I, uh, spent my junior year, uh, and sophomore and junior year in, in college when I, B: a song by the, uh, uh, B: I think the title of it was just Downtown, A: Uh-huh. B: uh, and if you recall how it goes downtown, ta, da, da, da, A: Right. B: uh, all I have to do is hear that song and I get strongly evoked memories of, of difficult times in school being behind on work, A: Uh-huh. B: uh, and my family now knows if they come into my study and, uh, I happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe I'm trying to get a project done, uh, at school, uh, and I'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away, A: That's their signal. B: They can hear the unconscious music signal behind it, A: Yeah. B: that's right. A: When did you first take your, uh, first piano lesson? B: Uh, probably about first grade, A: Yeah. B: and I have, uh, returned about every four or five years to thinking that I would like to do something about it. B: I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes B: and then inevitably I am swept away by the, the pressure of other types of things, A: Yeah. B: uh, A: It is a time consumer. B: It is. B: In order to continue to, to grow and B: I, I always think that I'll be able to do it B: and then I inevitably discover that I have no innate music talent relative to composition and that I struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other people take for granted, in composition themes A: Yeah. B: and I, B: keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them. B: I have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved, A: Right. B: uh, but in a, in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude B: and I keep thinking, gee, I thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand B: but, but it doesn't for me. A: No, A: it's making that, that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it. A: I was never able to, to master all that. A: In fact my brother and sister both, they were, oh, thirteen, sixteen years older than I, they went through the, uh, parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing, A: and when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again, A: they sold the piano, A: and is the turns out I was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to, A: so I, B: Uh-huh. A: that's one of things I felt like I missed in life A: and I, I really, A: in fact, uh, one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin, that is played on, uh, piano. A: I just, you know, I can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time to do that, B: Oh, , A: maybe one of these days, I'll, A: you know, I'm kind of like you, maybe one of these days I'll get around to it, A: I'll do something with the piano, A: but probably not. B: So we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance, uh, A: Just never got a chance to come out. A: No. B: That's the most fascinating thing A: Well, it's a pleasure talking with you. B: And you, sir, A: Best, of luck in your graduate school. B: take care. B: Okay. B: Good-bye. A: Good-bye. A: Okay, A: do you want to go first? B: Well, I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic. A: Fitness and exercise. B: Oh, God B: No, B: why don't you go first. A: Okay, A: um, I like to do, uh, weight training and, and cycling. And just walking, uh, swimming. A: I used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall. A: And the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore, A: so I had to kind of change my life-style a little bit B: Well, let me ask a personal question, B: how old are you? A: Thirty-eight. B: Oh, well then you should B: see over thirty-five everything goes downhill flop . A: Well, the rest of me is in pretty good shape A: it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to. B: Oh, you're lucky then B: because I've battled arthritis all my life, A: Really? B: I mean even since I was like about two or three. A: Oh. B: Then they diagnosed it, B: and usually most people are just absolutely crippled, B: and, uh, I do water aerobics. Religiously do water aerobics, A: Oh, I bet that helps. A: Uh-huh. B: I used to do it about six times a week B: and now I'm down to about four B: but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in in there, B: uh, I tried weight training B: and I'm telling you, you just, I just can't lift the things. A: Yeah. B: And the shock on the system is, is just too much, B: so I have stuck to water aerobics basically, you know, the weightless thing and, trying to keep this shape that way A: Yeah. B: but, you know, it's hard to find. B: I mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what I'm finding is that if they do offer it, you get the crowd of women that are, B: I think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way, to get in shape, without having to spend anything A: That's right. A: That's right. B: or it's the geriatric crowd. A: That's right. B: So, I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it. A: Well, I mean, if, if you know what your routine is, you can do that by yourself, A: and you probably do. B: Yeah, B: but you have to have an indoor pool. A: This is true. B: So, to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without, you know, drawing a lot of looks, means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity B: you look very odd in the water, A: Well, that, B: that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training, B: and that does look very odd in the water. A: I can believe that. A: Have you tried the, uh, the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center? B: No, B: and you know, that's the only place I haven't tried B: and people have told me. B: Now that's the Texins facility? A: Yes. B: I have been told that thing is just lovely. A: It is. A: They keep it at eighty-one degrees year-round. B: Huh. B: do you use that facility a lot? A: Um, a fairly, a fairly good amount, uh, more on the weekends, A: uh, I try to beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings, I try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center. B: Huh. B: Do you know if they have child care there? A: Um, have you done your attitude survey for this year yet? A: You need to put that on there, seriously. B: They don't, B: I don't, I don't work at T I. A: Oh, you don't? B: No, B: I used to work at T I, A: Oh. B: as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position B: actually when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry B: and I used to fill out those attitude surveys, A: Yeah. B: and, uh, uh, me and the insurance adjusters are, are very familiar with each other B: and my husband still works there, A: Yeah. B: and, um, I get my attitude expressed through them, B: but I find it to be very B: sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot mentality to save a few bucks. A: This is true. B: Uh, and never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I B: and I came down here B: and, you know, they did an attitude survey like six weeks after I had been working here B: and I asked about, you know, day care for the shift workers, A: Yeah. B: and boy I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that, you know, A: Well, it's not, B: it was not applicable to me B: and I was kind of horrified. A: Now what year are we talking about? B: We're talking nineteen seventy-eight. A: Okay, A: uh, things have become much more enlightened since then. B: They couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages A: Yeah, A: you know, we still don't have a day care facility A: but people are more sympathetic to it. B: I understand, I understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care, A: Yes. A: Yes. B: and, uh, the reason I'm at home is when I had my kids, and I was scheduled to go back and I tell you how much in the dark ages it was. Um, I had been rated number one in the field B: and then I took, uh, B: when I became pregnant I also got meningitis, and then delivered the first baby three months early, A: Oh. A: My gosh. B: and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home, B: and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment. A: Could you hold the phone for one second, B: Sure. A: Thanks. A: Okay, A: I'm back. B: And then they used to, uh, B: and then I had a second one eighteen months later, B: they told me to put them back to back B: and, of course, to maintain B: and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one, because that's when I go into labor four and a half months A: Wow. B: and I don't even know it. A: Of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back. B: Oh, yeah, B: very easy, B: very easy B: and they, they put me on twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then to, to try to control the labor and see how far it was going, B: and after the baby was born, since it wasn't premature, then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor. B: I think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof, because it was a, uh, thirteen thousand dollar bill, A: Really. B: but after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work, A: Yeah. B: and that was when they had, B: God it would have been the eighty-five layoff, A: Yeah. B: and I'll tell you how they handled this B: and I was just outraged, B: I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been, uh, terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months later B: and they didn't have any coverage under my name B: and I went back B: and I said what the hell is going on here, you know. A: Yeah, A: really. B: And they told me that, uh, oh, well, you know, you know, your husband works here B: and he's got a good salary B: we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway, B: and, uh, you know, we've got people here that really, you know, need to be working B: and so that we had just, B: you know, it was, this way we didn't have to layoff an active person B: and we'd just let you go. B: And it took me about a year of arguing, B: I said, you know, I've got to put this in writing to me, and because until they put it in writing, I couldn't get my insurance benefits A: Yeah. B: and I couldn't get my, uh, termination benefits either. A: There you go. B: I was just pissed as hell that they could do that. A: I, I can believe that. B: But I, I guess things have gotten better, B: I've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things , A: Oh, yeah, A: flex time is great. B: I still don't think that, they after my experiences that they could, you know, get me to go back, ever again A: I, I can understand. A: I can understand. A: Well, it's been good talking with you. B: But let me ask you this, since you use Texans, B: how much is it a month? A: Oh, shoot it's only about ten bucks a month. B: Now that's for individual. A: Yeah, A: I mean, uh, to add dependents is, is you know, maybe another dollar or something A: it's no big deal. B: That's it? A: Yeah. B: Now if you, if you pay your monthly charge, do you then pay separately for classes your taking? A: Uh, you do for classes, for classes, A: but to, I mean to use any of the facilities is, is no extra charge. B: God, that's cheap. A: Yeah, A: it is. B: That's really cheap. B: Do you have to be an active T I employee to join Texans or, Or a A: Or, or a A: or a dependent of one. B: God, I am so dependent these days. A: Really. B: It's a sense B: Oh, seen that my, my co-dependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbor's fence. A: Wonderful. B: Yeah B: So my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment B: but boy, I think I'm going to go contact Texans. B: I really think I am, A: Yeah. B: I mean, that beats any offer I've heard in a long time. A: Oh, yeah, A: it's great. B: Huh. B: All righty. B: When you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell? A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go A: it's not, it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty A: Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all. A: If you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the, to the Dallas site. B: Oh, I'm actually right on the Plano line. A: Oh, well, then you could go either one, B: Yeah. A: the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern, has a lot more niceties, amenities A: and you'd probably like the pool there. B: Oh, God it sounds like I would. B: I might do that then. B: Okay, B: I learned something here. A: Well, good. A: I'm glad. B: You can go back to work now. A: Well, thank you. B: Thank you. A: You have a good day. B: Bye-bye. A: Bye-bye. A: Okay, A: um, I guess, um, this is probably really a good subject for me because I really like to do, uh, hand work. A: Uh, mostly I do needlepoint, I guess. B: Oh really. A: But, um, B: What kinds of things have you done? A: Um, well, I've made a lot of baby gifts B: Uh-huh. A: It seem like that's, A: like, especially lately there's been so many babies, that, uh, bibs and blankets, and things like that. Wall hangings, um, B: Do you ever keep any of your stuff? A: Isn't that funny. A: No B: I do crochet and a lot of, uh, things like that, B: and I have very little of my own stuff, B: and it's kind of embarrassing. B: People say let me see some of your work. B: Oh well, can you do it ? A: Yeah, A: isn't that funny. A: I guess I do have one thing. A: A friend of mine gave me a clock kit B: Ooh. A: and, I, I needlepointed the face, A: and I, uh, kept that because she gave me that. A: So, B: That, that would be definitely something you'd want to keep. A: Oh, yeah. A: And it's real neat. B: Was, was the whole face done or just the numbers, and, and, like minute marks? A: Um, basically, the whole, A: well, no, A: I guess the minute marks, A: but the minute marks are done, they're like hearts. B: Oh. A: And then the, A: at the numbers they, they're kind of outlined and stuff. A: It, it was quite bit of work, A: but, you know, it was a lot of fun, too. A: I really like doing stuff like that. A: So. B: I did some needlepoint years ago, B: and then I got into the Bargello. A: Oh, what's that? B: Well, it's an Italian, um, needlework, using, using the uh, B: I started to say the canvas, B: but the, uh, huh, B: what kind of cloth uses that. B: I, I've just gone blank. B: But it's used with yarn, B: and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth A: Huh. B: and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors. B: Like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever, B: and it was used quite often in the colonial times to, uh, uh, to upholster chairs, and so forth, as well as the crewel, um, embroidery work that was done on them. A: Wow, that's interesting. A: What did you, what kind of things did you do? B: What I did, when I was doing that was mostly pillows, you know, for sofas and so forth, B: and I can't find one that I've done. A: Oh. B: It's one of those things B: I I didn't give them away, B: but I didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves or, or what, A: Yeah, B: and it, B: I was so proud of them when I got them finished, B: but I have no idea where they are. A: What did you call that? B: Bargello. B: It's B, A, R, G, E, double L, O out the A: Huh. A: That's, A: I've never heard of that before. A: I've probably seen it, though, B: I suspect you, I suspect you have. A: I mean, when you described it. A: Yeah. A: I mean, when you described it, it sounded like something, you know, that would be around, I guess. A: But, I've never heard of it before, A: and it's really interesting. A: Um, I guess I've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past, A: but I've kind of gotten out of that. A: I use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows. B: Me, too. A: Really B: Yes B: That's interesting. A: Yeah, A: it is. B: How did you know to choose this subject, tonight. B: That's funny B: What, B: how did you, B: what kinds of decorations did you use with the B: how were you decorating the baskets? A: Oh, basically bows and lace uh, ribbons. B: Um. A: Um. I really wanted to do, A: you know, so many of them now have the ribbons where, I'm not sure how they do it, A: but the ribbons, they make them, they like. A: I don't know how to explain it. A: They make them hard, you know? B: Like fabric that's been stiffened. A: Yeah. B: Yes. A: I've never done that, A: and those are so neat. A: I mean, I would really like to do those B: I've seen some, B: and there, there, they, B: I suspect they're fairly simple, because the one lady I've seen, I know that does it, I've never asked her any questions, B: but she has three kids all under the age of like six. B: And, and they're all a handful. B: So it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly. A: Oh, definitely, A: yeah. B: When I do, um, crochet, it's usually the lacy Victorian type things like that, A: Oh. B: and I stiffen those with a, a glue mixture. B: It's like white glue, B: and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then, um, allowed to dry in those, those draping bows, I mean, those draping streamers. I don't know. A: Oh. B: I was just. B: There's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with, uh, uh, high humidity, in a room, A: Yeah. A: That's I think that's what my concern was, was it really sure, and how they would, how they would last. B: Do you know what my concern is? B: How will I dust this thing? A: You're right. B: That's terrible. A: No A: that's true. A: That's funny. B: So many of my crafts, B: well, right now I'm looking at a little quilted, uh, uh, hanging, B: it's, like, it's a flag, B: and I don't want to wash it, because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth, B: but it's such a dust collector to be out, and so forth. A: Yeah B: And most of my things are dust collectors B: Uh, and I hate to dust. A: I know. B: So first thing I think of is how easy would this, thing be to clean. A: That's funny A: No, A: I do some, A: I have really gotten out of it. A: I don't do it quite as much as I used to. Um, I guess because I, I went back to school, A: so I don't have as much time. B: Oh, you don't have time. A: No, A: and I have two children also B: You definitely don't have time. A: It keeps me very busy. A: But I really enjoy it when I do do it, when I get the chance, you know. A: It's really, A: it's so relaxing to just sit, A: and, but once I get started, I can't put it down. A: I just, B: I have a similar problem. B: I've got to have time B: or I don't even want to get into it in the first place. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And so I end up lots of time not doing anything at all. A: I know, A: I started a project, it's been over a year ago that I swore I was going to finish for somebody for Christmas. B: You just didn't say which Christmas, right A: That's what I keep telling this person, A: well, I didn't tell you what year as if talking to other B: What was this project? A: Um, well, it's a, it's uh, cross stitch, A: and it's a picture, A: and it's a wildlife, A: it has deer and trees A: and, it's really beautiful, A: but it's going to be a lot of work, A: and you know, I've, I have worked on it quite a bit, but not as much as I'd like to. A: You know, it's just so hard. B: Now this is done in the needlepoint? A: Uh-huh. A: Well, I A: it's counted cross stitch, actually, is what I'm doing, A: and so it's really, since it's counted, you know, it's really a lot of work. B: Yes. B: Yes, B: I do know. A: Yeah. B: I have done a little bit of that, B: but I decided that that's something that demands my my, my total attention. A: Uh-huh. B: And so I've got to have total, almost total silence. B: I can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate. B: It sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece. A: Uh-huh. A: Yep. B: It is not, does not sound like an easy one to finish. A: No, A: it really isn't, A: and I tell you, really, I could just kick myself for even starting it, because I have a feeling I'm never going to get it done. A: I'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life B: Oh, I'm sure you'll get it done, B: but it just may not of the original, B: obviously not of the original time schedule. A: No, A: that's true. A: I, I just don't know when I'm ever, A: it just seems like there's just never enough time to pick it up and do it, A: you know, it's just really hard. A: But I really do A: like I said I really enjoy it when I do. A: It's just hard. B: Just hard finding the time that can be dedicated. A: Uh-huh. A: And there's, there's so many other things that, I, I have done, you know, in the meantime, like I said, so many baby gifts. A: I've made a lot of bibs, and wall hangings, A: and so, you know, those don't take much time at all. A: So it's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them. B: Do you, do you use patterns, I mean, like a book of patterns, B: or do you go out an buy a, a kit, like for a bib or something like that. A: No, A: I usually just buy a pattern book. A: I have several pattern books, A: and I just go with those. B: Okay. A: And then I buy the bibs separate. A: Usually I think it's a little bit cheaper in the long run, A: and then I just use whatever colors I want to. A: I don't usually use the colors they tell me to. B: Um. A: And it, it depends on what it is, you know. A: But some things, especially letters, if they suggest certain colors for letters, I just go with whatever I want to. B: That's what I would do, too. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: Or whatever I have. A: There's yeah, there's a few designs I guess I've done myself, but not very many. A: Real simple ones, you know, I do. A: I've made, I made a little, uh, little, uh, little thumb print and made it a bunny. B: Ooh. A: It was really easy. A: I mean, just, just did a thumb print. You know. B: What. With ink? A: Uh-huh. B: Oh, okay. A: And then, see I didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print, A: you know, that was just the ink, A: and then I made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth. A: That was so simple B: Oh, that sounds really neat. A: It didn't take anything at all. B: Did you do, did you use, like, uh, a stamp pad and ink. A: Uh-huh. A: And then I just, B: Ok B: so you, B: just like being finger printed ... A: Okay, A: so what kind of movies have you seen, lately, I guess? B: Um, a lot, B: well, the last movie I saw, but it wasn't my choice, was the NINJA TURTLE movie A: Obviously you have kids. B: That's right. B: Yeah, B: but my preference is the one we saw before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. A: I haven't seen that one yet. B: That's an excellent movie. A: Um, the last movie I saw was, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. B: Oh, was that good. B: I heard, A: Uh, see, I'm not a big Julie Roberts fan. B: Oh, okay. A: But I was a lot, I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be. B: Well, that's good. A: It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: it was a pretty good movie. B: SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat. A: I, I'm ready to go. A: It just, A: it's, you know, hasn't worked out that way yet. B: Right. A: You know, it's, uh, it looks good, you know if you like thrillers, anyway. B: Yeah, B: it is. B: Right. B: And I do. A: In fact, people I've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards. A: So B: Really. B: Oh, I love them like that. A: Yeah. B: I'm not, B: I mean, I, I like all ranges of movies, B: but I like that where they run tense. A: Uh-huh. B: I really enjoy, B: they keep me guessing the whole time. B: It's really, it was really interesting. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, what other movies have you seen then lately? B: Oh. A: Other than the, A: I assume you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES. B: Yes, B: the new one, of course A: Is that any good, A: I mean, I'm sure I'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives, and she's got two boys that I took to see the first one. B: Oh drawn A: So I'm sure I'm going to see the next one here real soon. B: Amarillo. B: I didn't see the first one. B: My husband said it was, um, about the same lines. A: Oh, well, then it won't be too bad. B: So, yeah. A: You know, it wasn't impressive necessarily, A: but it was better than it could have been. B: Right, B: right. B: And I was impressed with the fact that, um, it wasn't that childish. A: Yeah. B: not that great or didn't do that great anyway. A: A lot of, B: Let me see. B: Let me see B: another movie I watched. B: Uh, I want to see, uh, that new one, uh, that won all those Academy Awards this year, DANCES WITH WOLVES. A: Uh-huh. B: I haven't seen that. B: Have you seen that one yet? A: Yeah. B: What, what, what, A: I, I absorbed all of that movie in one sitting. A: Uh, I guess what made it so good was the cinematography, B: The, the wide open, the spaces, A: Yeah, A: and the music A: and, uh, well, it had an excellent story line. A: Everything about it was good. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, I thought an excellent one, too, was MISERY with Kathy Bates and James Caan. A: I'm not a James Caan fan, A: but that was a well directed and acted movie. B: Is that right? A: I'd recommend it. A: It's a little on the violent side B: Uh-huh. A: but then what movie isn't anymore. B: Right, B: right. B: Yeah, B: our movies today, it used to be X B: and, you know, and P G used to be R B: and, seems like the rating system, you know, is kind of switching that way a little bit A: Well, I have no objections to it. A: It's just, uh, A: and it's a matter of your taste, uh, B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Oh, yeah. B: It's just that, B: yeah, B: it's just that the rating system seems, you know, instead of having X now, they have what, N C seventeen? A: Yeah. B: They just changed it because X had a connotation with it, you know, B: so, A: And even on those type they don't show what you expect. B: Right. B: A lot of those are really violent type movies. A: Right. B: Really gory. A: Yeah, A: that seems to be the norm of most movies, A: but what the hey. B: Yeah. A: This is America. B: Let me see. B: One movie I saw, I guess it was a while back, RED OCTOBER. A: Yeah. B: Have you seen that one? A: Yes, A: I have. A: That was pretty good. B: Yeah, B: I read the book before B: so I knew the story line going in, B: but they changed some things in the movie. B: It wasn't the same. B: I thought the book was better than the movie, B: but I thought the movie was really good as well. A: I always wait for the movie. A: I don't have time to read the book. B: Yeah. B: I don't, B: I read about one or two thick novels like that a year. You know, A: Uh-huh. B: that's about all the time I can, I can spare. B: But that was a good show I thought, you know. B: I read about how they did, uh, an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine. B: You know, that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water. B: It was, it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic. A: Yeah. B: All those underwater scenes. B: I thought, you know, B: it looked to me like it was a real submarine, that was in the water, you know. A: They , A: That's the magic of Hollywood, special effects. B: Yeah. A: I hear this movie F X part two coming out is, uh, pretty good. B: Is that right? A: Did you ever see the original one? B: I didn't. A: It was, uh, A: you ought to rent the, uh, F X part one. A: It doesn't say part one, A: but it, it's F slash X. B: Huh. What's that about? A: A, uh, special effects man who somehow gets involved in this, um, A: oh, I'm not sure. A: I can't remember. A: It's been a while since I've seen it. A: But he, he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody A: and he has to go underground, A: and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done. B: Hm. A: And, uh, B: To, to fool people B: and , A: Right, A: and using makeup and using the all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go. B: All the tricks. B: Uh-huh. B: That sounds like an interesting concept. A: But you need to rent the first one first. B: To understand what's going on in the second? A: Uh, if, if that is that the second one follows the first. A: I don't know if they have the, uh, original actors on that first one to that one. B: Uh-huh. B: They're supposed to be coming out with all these Desert Storm movies, this summer, too A: Oh. A: I expected those. B: Yeah. A: I mean, Hollywood, I mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there, I think. B: Yeah. B: Well, they had some, B: in some of those, you know, they, I guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about Lebanese and, and, you know, and, and Americans A: Uh-huh. B: and they decide, oh, make it Iraqis and Americans, you know, B: and they just change the title and, uh, and reshot a few parts, you know, where they, yeah, you know, where they could. B: I guess they figured we wouldn't, can't tell the difference between an, A: Actual names, will not be used. B: Yeah. B: Right. A: Eventually I'm sure they will come out with the, the, the proper names. B: Yeah. B: Right . B: It was such a, B: it, B: I guess they, they'll probably come out with a lot of movies, you know. B: It was, it was such a rout though, you know. B: I don't know, you know, B: they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or, or about, or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured. A: Latest story, A: Uh-huh. A: Kevin Costner I understand is supposed to be play Schwartzkopf, supposedly. B: Is that right? A: I don't know. A: That's just one of the many rumors that floats around. B: Yeah. A: Or what you read. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, I think we've probably, A: Pretty much used up the tape, I guess. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: it's been about five minutes. B: It's been nice talking with you. A: Same. A: And, uh, we'll Talk to you on the next go around. B: Keep on watching those movies, huh? B: Okay. B: Bye-bye. A: Adios. A: Are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the B: Sure, uh, A: okay. B: I'll offer anything that I can on the subject. B: Uh, my husband and I just bought a, just moved here recently B: and, uh, we bought, uh, this house about, uh, I don't know, year and a half ago. B: What we have here now is just a basic three bedroom, two bath, brick house which is, uh, completely different from what I had had before. B: When I was working and before I married, uh, I lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and, uh, historic old houses and things like that B: so I, uh, tried to, B: I was in the process of renovating a house and, uh, that was about seventy-five years old. A: Oh, my. B: So, uh, it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled, jacked up, uh, new plumbing, new wiring, wallpaper, paint, B: everything you can think of, that house had to have A: You, You are experienced I would say. B: Well, I, I really did enjoy it, uh, you know, B: it was amazing what I found out I could do on my own if I just put my mind to it. A: Well, I agree. B: Yeah. A: I have done something, uh, like that, too, only not nearly as extensive. B: Uh-huh. A: But it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch, style home. Uh, after having a one that was historical looking. B: It is. B: It is. B: Yeah. B: That's, that's true. B: When, uh, I met my husband, he was living in an apartment at the time B: and, and, uh, the town that I was living in only about eighty miles from here. B: So, uh, you know, I, we, B: really it was just B: the market was so good, B: we hadn't really planned on buying B: and, as you probably heard from the, in the Dallas and Texas area period the housing market is just unreal. B: I mean you can get things for such a song. A: Yes. B: So, that's, that's really why we ended up in a house like this. B: This is not what we, you know, what we want to stay in forever, because I have to have my, I've found that after doing this other house, I have to have my hands into stuff B: and, you know, I'm always just wanting to paint and, and wallpaper and redo and redo, A: Uh-huh. B: so, uh, you know, I, I'm ready to get ahold of another one that I can have a little more input into B: so, A: Well, maybe you can, uh, make that one charming and, and make a little bit money, uh, B: Yeah. B: That's, that's the key, you know, B: the thing is, uh, when we moved in they had just, uh, painted, we're, you know, wallpapered, new carpet and everything B: so I feel sort of, uh, you know, like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now and do it over just because I'm in the mood to do it. B: So, uh, we'll see, we'll see how much longer we're here. A: Yes. A: Well, we just moved to Charlotte, from Enid, Oklahoma. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, Oklahoma of all places. A: So I know, of what you're talking about, as far as the market was concerned B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: and I'll tell you, uh, we, we had kind of a charming house. A: It was a cedar shake house, and very weathered. B: Oh, yes. A: And, uh, it was about fifty years old, but not not really, uh, traditional looking, particularly. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, so I tried to make it, after I sold my business A: I, in, in, A: I spent almost three years redoing. B: Oh, yeah. A: And I considered it a full time job B: Oh, it is, B: yeah. A: and when we did, uh, A: we kind of had planned this, uh, trek to the east, because we're both originally from this part of the country. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. B: I see, B: uh-huh. A: And so, I think some of the things that I did paid off. A: For instance, one thing that I did that might even be a good suggestion for you uh, was something I did on the outside. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: I love old estate, estate sales. B: Yes, B: yes. A: I happened to go to just a little estate sale that, just a little white frame house, where the couple, uh, was very old, and had gone into nursing homes B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: and uh, all the men started going down to the barn. B: Oh, yeah. B: Uh, oh A: And so I, A: well shoot I'm going, B: That's where I need to go A: Yes, A: I'm going to the barn, too. B: Exactly. A: They, uh, auctioned some tools and, things like that, B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: but then they went over and started, uh, auctioning this big stack of bricks. B: Oh. A: And, so, well, I thought, gee, I've been wanting to, do some brick, uh, walkways for a time. B: Uh-huh. B: Work, B: right, B: right. B: Uh-huh. A: Anyway, it ended up after some pretty, uh, heavy bidding, that I got all those bricks for forty dollars. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, my word. A: And, so my husband and I loaded bricks in his, pickup truck for days. B: Oh, no. B: Oh, my word. A: But, what we ended up with was about four thousand. B: For forty dollars? A: For forty dollars. B: Oh, my. A: And so what we did, A: we had built a deck on the back of that house, B: Uh-huh. A: but it needed A: and, it was quite large out to, into the yard B: Something. B: Uh-huh. A: but, on either side of it to the ends of the house it just needed to be all tied together. B: Uh-huh. A: So we, made brick patios, and walkways. B: Right. B: Oh, how fun. B: Oh, how nice. A: And so for, A: and he, he did the digging, which was about six inches, B: Uh-huh. A: but I figured the sand and all, had that delivered and, leveled it and, and, placed most all the bricks. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. B: Right. B: Uh-huh. A: And it turned out beautifully. B: Oh, I bet. B: And what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way A: Yes. A: Well, it nearly killed me B: Yeah, B: but, but you did stagger back and say, oh, doesn't this look nice. A: I hated to leave it. B: Well, let me ask you, B: when you laid those bricks, B: I know my parents bought a house about ten years ago, B: they're fixing to sell it again, but, and move again. B: They're kind of, B: my mom's like I am. B: She's a renovator, a lover of old things A: Uh-huh. B: and, you know, they have to be doing something constantly. B: And the patio that came with that house, uh, was not laid on a, like, B: I don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something on, on top of the sand and then lay the bricks. A: No A: we, B: But they have, they have a problem with these little like sand bugs or something that drill in between all these bricks. A: Well, I, B: And, of course you know you have the, uh, the weeds that come up in between the bricks or, and things like that. A: Well, no, A: I, I didn't have that trouble because, uh, we laid the, A: I did get some material and studied every bit of material that I could study, B: Uh-huh. A: but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them, B: Yeah. B: I see. A: because when you start A: and we put them on a base of four inches of sand B: Okay, B: yeah. A: and then we, uh, we swept sand in between, A: but but it was an error to, to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever. B: Uh-huh. A: You just put them together as close as you can. B: As tight as you can. B: That's probably, because they had, you know B: every spring my mom says we're going to have a a barbecue and tell everybody, guess what, B: we're going to, we're going to redo the patio, you know, B: we're going to pull up all the bricks, A: Uh-huh. B: but, uh, they just, they just haven't brought themselves to do it. A: Yeah, A: well, B: So, A: and I also used a rubber hammer, a lot, to, uh, you know, B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: if it wasn't quite level or something, I'd just get that, rubber hammer and, uh, and, and you know, B: Right. A: I think that they could, A: if they have problems with, uh, sand bugs of some kind I think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a, oh, a fairly regular basis, for a while anyway. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: Right. B: Right, B: well the thing that's funny is they've done, uh, they've done things like that, you know, B: I'll catch her out there spraying around, B: and then it's like, in two days time they'll come home from work B: and those little things are back. B: It's just, they're the most resilient little characters B: and so, I don't know what they're finally going to do. B: She may just, B: hopefully they'll sell the house, and go somewhere else A: Well, I think, I think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are B: And then she won't have to worry about it. A: and, B: What are these things? A: yeah, A: is it diazinon A: or what is it that will, uh, B: Right. A: Dursban or something like that. B: Yeah, B: what it, what it is that'll, that'll, take care of them. A: Dursban , A: I think in this area or most all areas they use, you know, for ticks and fleas. B: Yeah. A: And you know, they're, awful hard to do anything with. B: Right. B: Oh, that's true. B: That's true. B: But my, my dad farms B: and, you know, she's always telling him, isn't there something that, that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray, you know, out in the, out in the field, that you can get rid of, these bugs, A: Yeah. B: but, uh, A: I bet Dursban would do it. B: It might, it might do it, B: yeah. B: She's got so many she's got just a gorgeous yard, so many, uh, flowers and her, her four cats, you know, B: so she's sort of, uh, real funny about what she sprays. A: Yeah. A: I think, uh, you probably just need to make sure that it dries, very, very uh, well, before she lets her cats out, or something, like that. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: Well, gosh, Deb, we could talk all day couldn't we B: I know, B: I, I was just, you know, it just seems B: like I, as I said when I heard the, what the subject was, I thought oh, gosh I haven't thought about, uh, what I went through at that other house in so long. B: I've been so busy. B: But, uh, I don't know B: of everything that I did, I guess I enjoyed probably wallpapering the most B: and I thought that would be the hardest thing to do. A: Yes. B: But, uh, gosh, you know, I ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house, uh, up the stairway, even. A: Wow. B: You know, I just had a ball with it, A: Oh. B: it was so much fun. A: Oh, good. B: Yeah. B: And I've sworn up and down, B: my mom's, uh, my mom's great grandparents had this huge Victorian house in Paris, Texas, B: and the one thing that she ended up with is, was the old door, that was, that was on the front door of that house A: Uh-huh. A: Yes. B: and she has that up in her attic B: and I have sworn that it, B: I'm going to find a house to put that door on before she does B: So, as far as looking toward the future, you know, that's my plan. B: I'm going to have to move fast, I think, though, because, uh, you know, as a, A: All right, do you do exercise? B: I do, B: yes, B: I, uh, uh, I guess it actually changes, B: I do a number of different things simply walking with my wife A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle. B: Uh, and then moving up, I run in the mornings, A: Uh-huh B: not every morning, it probably averages about two days a week A: Right. B: and then with my wife I actually go to the gym and lift weights, which isn't, I understand, quite exercising, B: but it's along the lines, A: Right. B: How about yourself. A: Well, um, that's a hard question to answer because I do physical things, but I don't always set out for them to be exercise. B: Uh-huh. A: I walk with my parents, occasionally, A: nothing's real regular about this because I have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule, A: and, um, I play racquetball, A: but I haven't since I've been out of school. A: I don't have anywhere to do that, A: but that's going to start soon again B: Uh-huh. A: and, um, I play softball once a week, which is kind of more recreation than exercise. B: Uh-huh. A: Because I really don't like to exercise, A: I think that's the basic point of it, is I'm not, I, I don't enjoy it if I know that it's exercise, B: Right. A: but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity, I don't mind B: Right. A: so I have to disguise it, A: it's like feeding little babies food and telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it. B: That's right. A: That's kind of the same thing for me. A: I have to not know that it's exercise so I can do it. B: Right. B: So you look at it more as a task. A: Well, yeah, A: if it's exercise, it's a task. B: Right. A: I don't want to do anything I have to do. B: I see. A: I mean, I'll voluntarily clean the bathroom, A: but I won't do it if I have to do it. B: Right, B: right. B: So, I'm thirty-two years old which is probably different than yourself A: Uh-huh. A: Right, A: I'm twenty-two. B: and so, it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise. A: Right. B: My job at Texas Instruments, I have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls, so, that, I don't get any exercise doing that A: Right. B: and plus there's a build up of stress A: Uh-huh. B: so I need to go out and take those walks after dinner, B: and I need to go out in the morning and run B: or I'll just get nuts A: Right. B: so that's kind of a motivator, B: so even though I can look at it as a task, the, you know, I kind of get the, I get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying, Well, I'm lowering my chance of heart attack, and thus, that type stuff. A: Right. A: Eating right and no cholesterol and all that. B: Sure, B: that all, B: I, I do all that. A: Yeah, A: we, A: I'm sure, I will do, A: I'm doing that more and more than I used to B: Yeah. A: I'm getting better about this knowing that I need exercise and doing it, but it's still at the task stage. B: Right. A: Is it a pleasure for you, A: or are you, B: Well, it's a, B: something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable. A: Right. B: I do that at the end of the day, B: and it takes, you know, B: that, that during that time the stress from the day goes away. B: I get to share whatever I did with my wife, and, and vice versa. A: Right. B: Going to the gym is, is actually something different than, than, like, B: oh, and the running, B: and I enjoy that too. A: Uh-huh B: Year, B: I've been running since high school on track teams and the like, A: Oh. B: so, running, I, I'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more A: Uh-huh. A: Right, B: and you don't think about the pain of it. B: You, you, you take the time to relax some how B: and you think about other things. B: During those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you can't breathe and this and that, A: Uh-huh B: and that's no fun. B: And it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people. A: Right, A: that's, A: I never got past that stage. B: Yeah, B: the the, uh, weight lifting on the other hand is actually, you know, B: I think I look better. A: Right. B: I have just a, I don't, I'm not a huge person, B: I'm just a regular looking guy, B: but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife, B: and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is, is attractive A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: so that pays also. A: That's good. B: Yeah, B: so, so I guess that aspect of that takes away the work the, with my wife, which is nice, A: Yeah. B: I love her, you know, B: I enjoy being with her A: Uh-huh. B: I guess that's one thing, B: but also, uh, that, that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles. A: Right, A: that's it, A: I do the occasional push up and sit up. A: I haven't really brought myself to go to the the gym, because that's very stressful to me, B: Yeah. A: because I feel, I felt real competitive there, A: and I need to find some place I could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are ... B: Oh, yeah, B: I don't, I don't let that bother me, B: but, yeah, B: that's something that comes with time, too. You know, A: Right. B: I'll tell you, the sit ups and push ups are excellent you know, A: Uh-huh. B: it's your own, B: you, you're, you're struggling against your own body weight A: Right. B: you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower, by putting your arms further apart or closer together, by doing them real quick or real slow A: Right. B: and you can actually get a good B: you can, I know in the push up, at least, you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups. A: Uh-huh. A: That's a good idea, A: but I do have my ride, A: we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house. B: Oh, is that right. A: I'll do those once in a while just you know, like at eleven thirty when Love Connection's on and I can't sleep, B: Right. B: Yeah. B: Right. A: I'll get up and stair step for half an hour B: That's funny. A: so. B: Yeah. A: It's, I guess, pretty, pretty healthy, A: but I don't have a regular plan, that's B: Yeah. A: I need to get started on that. B: Well, you know, maybe not. B: I'd say, I'd say at twenty-two you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting, getting the exercise otherwise. A: Right. B: When your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan, A: Uh-huh. B: and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle between, uh, when you, when you add something to your life, when you add a plan to your life, B: something else has to go away A: Uh-huh. B: and that's the hard decision, is, okay, if I'm going to run in the mornings, what am I, what do I trade it off for. B: Well, the answer's sleep, right. A: Sleep B: If I'm going to walk at night, what do I trade it off for. B: Well, Star Trek A: Uh-huh. B: or, you know, it, it, it's always trade offs, B: and you actually have to, as you get older you have to really think what can go, and what, to, to, to replace this thing. A: Yeah. B: It's, I mean, not just exercise, but anything. B: It's very hard. A: Right. B: And, uh, I don't, I don't think you should worry about not having a program yet. A: That'll come some day when I, B: Yep. B: Yeah, B: I guess if you care, or if your wife, your future wife, uh, gives you a reason to care which helps A: Right. A: Well, I hope so. B: Well, I think we covered it. A: Yeah, A: sounds good. B: Nice talking with you, Craig. A: Yeah, A: you too. A: Have a nice day. B: You too. B: Good day. A: Bye. B: Bye. A: Okay, A: what do you think is the biggest problem? B: The biggest problem, well, like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that, uh, you know, you can throw money at it, A: Uh-huh. B: but it's, B: I don't know, B: to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know, because, I mean, the general values that we're teaching kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school, I mean, A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Is it the, do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the values they get from home. B: Uh, well, the values, more or less at home and the T V, just a general, B: I mean, learning is not a revered endeavor, really, B: I mean, it's a lot more, B: it's socially, well I won't say socially unacceptable, B: but whereas like in, uh, a person that, uh, B: they put a lot more emphasis on athletics B: and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society, B: and I think that carries over to school a lot. A: Right. B: So. A: Yeah, A: I, I, I, I think that the biggest problem is, uh, with the, uh, with the home environment being part of it. A: You know, if, A: I think too many parents expect, uh, the school to teach, uh, the moral aspects of, of things to the to the kids and, you know, while we're not going to worry about, uh, teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that, you know, and then expect them to pick it up at school, A: you're not going to do that, you know, A: you're going to carry, carry with, carry to school, uh, out into the world, you know, what you learned at home, A: and, uh uh, I think that that part of that showing up now, you know, with, with things because kids I think have probably less respect than for, for people than in, in other things, than we may have seen in the past, uh, B: Yeah. A: and part of it's the, the family, I think, A: and part of it's, uh, the living conditions of certain people are subjected too, A: drugs is a big problem now, A: and I think that's, that's, that's another root problem. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: you know, I wonder if that's a root problem or not, B: because I think about that a lot, B: and it's just like, everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now, B: but I wonder, you know, B: do you get the, B: oh, that's kind of side tracked, B: but, uh, I just remember seeing on the news the other night, they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better A: Uh-huh. B: I thought, well, you know, of course they're doing better, and not so much when I was growing up, B: Catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools, B: but, uh, they still had a, a better success rate, simply because they started with a lot better raw material. B: I mean everybody that went to a Catholic school had, uh, at least the parents did, at least, had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it. A: Right, A: Right. B: And I wonder if, not so much that, uh, A: Well, I think it's, like you say, it's, it's the socioeconomic mix A: there, you know, the, they're, A: you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who are basically, uh, that might be more well well off, you know, going to a private Catholic school or whatever, uh, A: and, and they're not all that way, A: but, you know, some that are um, that, they're, they're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city, uh, you know, public schools. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: this is interesting because in my mind I don't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment, B: but, uh, this, this was actually inner city A: Yeah. B: people were sending, B: I mean, just because their kids had the ability and the, and the drive to do, try and get an education, they didn't send him to a public school, you know, B: like you said, you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance, A: Yeah, A: well, you know, in a lot of cases like that, where, you know, if kids are going to a public parochial school like that, it's, it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education. It shows, I think it shows that the parents have some, uh, desire for, for the kid to do, do well, you know, A: and that may be passed on down to the kid as well, A: and, uh, maybe they pick up on that. B: Yeah. A: And then from the other aspect, um, maybe the, uh, school itself has, has, has more emphasis on, uh, trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller, uh, A: they may be able to, to give the resources that's needed to, uh, to do a good job. B: Yeah, B: I mean, B: and what do you, what would you do to fix the school systems? A: Uh, that's a tough question how to fix the school system. B: Yeah, A: Uh, with, uh, A: I would try to, I guess, to see about getting parents more involved, with, try to, to come up with more ways to do that. Uh, uh, uh, stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students, and, uh, more, more classes that I think that are, A: and I think this is happening some around the country in terms of, um, morals, trying to teach the kinds of things that, that aren't getting taught at home, and, uh, and, and respect for other people. A: Uh, I think that's a big part of it. A: You know, people, you know, A: if you don't care about property and people, you know, you're not going to care about, uh, about learning, I think. You know, B: Yeah. A: you're not going to really care about yourself. B: Yeah. B: That's what I was going to say. B: It's the chicken and the egg thing. B: I wonder, a lot of times, you know, people, I mean, a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools vandalism wise, A: Right. B: and you get, B: I mean, it's been a while since I been in high school. B: They're even in grade school when they do that. B: But I can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that. B: But you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything, and take it out on the school. A: Well, you know, and I, A: that's not an but that's not an easy task, you know, A: that's why I say, it's, it's a tough question what would you do, A: because, you know, even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when, uh, when, when you're growing up in, you know, in a home which may be, uh, just the pits, A: and uh, you don't have any, any kind of a good environment to live in, you know, A: it's kind of hard to say, well, you need to take care of other people's stuff as well, when you're, when you barely have anything yourself. A: So. B: Yeah. A: I could see where that would be a problem, A: and I think that's, I think it's ... B: Okay. A: Okay. A: Well, I, uh, I guess because I work quite a bit with lawyers, I'm not a lawyer, uh, that I find a lot of things are so specialized that I'm not sure, A: and I, I look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of, of the value of, and worth, so that they have real problems when it comes to, uh, uh, A: they can find guilt or innocence B: Right. A: uh, but then when you quantify things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, B: I agree, too. B: I don't think the jury should be the ones that, that put the sentencings down. B: I think the judges should, B: or even a panel of, of lawyers if, if it got to that point. Might be better at than just regular civil people. Not knowing, you know, exactly what things are, from, from murder on up to like tax stuff, you know. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Because I find that, uh, A: I've been on a few juries A: and, uh, as a say, I, I tend to be around, uh, civil cases because I've been an expert witness some, A: and, uh, many matters are so complicated that it's so hard to, uh, come up with the fair value, uh, or the fair sentence A: and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is, uh, you know the range of, of possible values or terms or, you know, how heinous was the crime. B: Right. A: Uh, that, uh, A: when I only do something one, two or three times I'm hardly an expert on it, A: and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three. B: Yeah B: and, A: And so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was a, you know, worth five years or twenty-five. B: Right, B: that's, B: yeah. B: And, and most people that do sit on juries, B: some people just sit on them once in their lifetime, you know, if they're that lucky sometimes Or, you know, what, whatever the case may be. And, and may not have any idea of what, what the standard punishment would be for it. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: And it, they may have some different idea, B: I mean, it might be more important for them to put a sentencing down that was, uh, longer, you know, that didn't fit, the punishment didn't fit the crime. Or not long enough or, you know, whatever the case may be. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: I, I think the judges do have that, that better knowledge of it. B: The only thing I worry about sometimes is if, if you get somebody in there that, that has a name, that is the defendant and, you know, sometimes, might have more pull, which that does happen. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, we can't say it doesn't, because it does happen. B: I mean not everybody is, you know, has, has the right morals sometimes. B: People can be paid off or politically or whatever the case may be A: Uh-huh. B: and sometimes that's not real fair either, though B: so, A: Well, one of the others things that gets me on, on the juries is that often in the newspaper, I, I tend to hear two things that, well, that go on. A: One is, you often see in the headlines the big numbers. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences, or get changed by a judge or an Appeals Court B: Right. A: and that never makes the, the press A: and so, when, uh, you or I as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what because we see the headlines, uh, A: and we don't have, again, a lot of knowledge, A: so we don't know what is really going on, what is, uh, really the range of sentences or awards that are, uh, are actually, uh, in the end applied. B: Right. B: Right. B: Well, well, also what I don't think is fair, either, is when you have like a, say a rapist, come in, B: and, and his attorney gets his sentences, sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge, like, I don't know what, assault or something or, A: Uh-huh. B: But, which that doesn't make any sense to me either. B: this is the second time the person has said 'which that' I know it's hard to prove rape and whatnot B: and, and, and the person that was raped or whatever doesn't, B: I mean it's embarrassing and all this other stuff A: Uh-huh. B: and they, they're put on like, they were the ones that caused it or whatever, B: but, to me, when you do the crime, then you should pay for whatever you did, B: and, and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge. B: I don't, I don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say, Oh, well, you know, that was a breeze, B: I can go out and do it again and, you know have the same thing happen. A: Yeah. B: That's, that's not right. A: Well, that's where, uh, the role of juries is, is restricted A: and, I'm not sure I'd want to change that aspect of it, A: one is, it's restricted in the sense that, juries only decide the charges that are actually, uh, brought, you know B: Right. A: if it's first degree rape, second degree rape or whatever, they only get to decide on that, A: well, okay this person has been charged with first degree rape, uh, A: and you can decide guilt or innocence on that. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, such like, maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees. A: The other thing that juries are restricted on and, and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my, even in my own experiences, that you usually don't get to hear all the information. B: Yeah. A: It's what information is presented A: and, uh, I don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards, A: but often juries hear only a fraction of the, of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence. B: And to me, how can you, how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of, whether it be, whether it pertains to the case or not, B: somebody thinks it, it had, because they've got it there. A: Uh-huh. B: So the lawyers, the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information. A: Yeah, A: and the truth that's brought out is, uh, as I say, when I've heard about, you know, B: Don't they? A: the oath is to tell the truth, A: the whole truth and nothing but the truth, is that they want, uh, A: they don't want, uh, the whole truth. A: I mean you can say, B: They only put part of it. A: yeah. B: Yeah. A: The, A: because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the, of the truth. B: Right. B: Well, that's just like that old witness game, B: well, it's a game kids play, too, B: but, uh, somebody did it, just for your train of thought where they, they showed something B: and they asked, B: they, there were, uh, like four people, B: Hello. A: Hello. A: My name is Nola. A: I'm in Plano, Texas. B: Hi Nola, B: I'm Steve. B: I'm in Dallas, Texas. A: Not too far away. B: No, B: that's unusual. B: Seems like usually, A: I've had some from Plano, too. B: Oh yeah. B: I think all mine have been East Coast people so far A: Uh-huh. A: Okay B: So, A: um, let's see. B: social changes, A: Social changes. B: what's that mean? A: That sounds like not as recent social changes, too, like back to the sixties or fifties, I guess B: Yeah. A: Think we can handle that? B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I definitely, B: I mean there's plenty of things to talk about there. B: That's a, A: Okay, uh, A: shall I go ahead and push one? B: Yeah, B: sure. A: Okay A: You want to go ahead and start? B: Uh, I was hoping that you would B: but, oh, A: Oh B: In social changes is that, B: uh, it seems to me that, uh, A: That involves a lot of different areas, I think. B: Does that, Yeah. B: Like a lot, B: it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, is even more, true today. You know? A: Yeah, A: there is a a big difference in the, uh, economic, um, status of, uh, people although I think that has been true, uh, always. A: Um, perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was. B: Yeah. B: It's like people are starting to give up hope B: and they start out very poor. B: Let's see, B: that's a bad tangent to get on. B: What else has changed between the sixties and the eighties and the nineties? A: Uh, B: No. A: I think, uh, in my situation, A: I have three children A: and we're, uh, home schooling. A: So, education, you know, things that relate to education, um, are things that I think about a lot. A: Um, I think that, and I think that involves social changes a lot. A: Uh, for instance I think the schools are having more and more problems because of, uh, things that are happening socially in the world around them and in, in, because of their parents A: and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home, rather. More not than are. And children being put in day-care centers from very early, A: and, and I think that a lot of these things that have been happening, such as the day-care centers and things, are having a big effect on the social changes. A: Because of the way children are being raised, they're not learning the values they need to learn. B: Yeah. A: And they're not, um, they don't have the self-esteem that they need to have A: and they don't have the, um, a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and deal with the things in the world. A: And, uh, I think we're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang, gang things that are happening A: and, and, um B: Yeah. B: It seems, so that, B: yeah, B: that is a pretty big change. B: It seems, even not just single parent families but with no guidance B: but it seems like, some of these even ladies that, that'll work and have, a baby and then, you know, after two or three months, go back to work. You know, A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Oh it's, B: well that, that, I mean that's very, young for a baby. A: That's really sad. A: I think that a lot of people, A: and they think they have to A: but, B: Yeah. A: I, I think that if they really tried, they wouldn't have to. A: And, I, I think that if they didn't that, and it became more of the standard not to that, uh, I don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home. You know? And have a more solid, uh, foundation for the kids. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: I mean they're going to, B: like you said, I mean, there's, they might be saving money, B: I mean even if they had to pay more now, I mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work. Even though it's higher productivity is short-term. A: That's right. A: It's already, It already costs society much more because of it. A: You know it, A: trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those. You wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them, you know. B: Yeah. A: Um, there's, A: and I think, uh, a lot of it is selfishness. A: People have become very selfish. A: They don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that. B: yeah A: There are a lot of two parent, um, situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do, you know. B: Oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment A: Rather than that, she has to have the money particularly. A: Or, maybe there's a small need for money A: so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself, too You know, B: Huh. It, B: Yeah. B: It's interesting how, uh, B: home study. Is that what you said? A: Home school. B: Home school. A: Yeah. B: Is that, uh, is, is it like, uh, a preschool level then or through grade school or, A: No. A: I , I have, uh, one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler. And one on the way B: Oh I B: Oh, well you sound busy B: So you're teaching them, completely A: Yes. A: Yes. B: Huh. A: And I think, uh, it's becoming, uh, more popular then it has been for a while, I think. A: Home schooling's always been around A: but, uh, I can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools. A: Um, and a lot of it is discipline problems. B: Yeah. A: A lot of it is, A: and you can tell which kids have been in day-care centers. A: It, it's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things. That, um, they've been raised in a day-care center. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: That's pretty sad because, I mean, I don't know, something's got to change with the schools. B: That's what it all boils down to in the end, usually anyway. A: Well, I think it's going to, change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else. B: When they're young, B: Yeah A: The home is the base, A: it's the basic unit. A: And that's the, where it all starts A: and if we don't start making changes in the homes A: and maybe part of that is educating parents better. B: Yeah. A: And educating, uh, you know B: Changing people's expectations. A: I know they do do some, they do have some classes in, um, high schools and things for kids to, uh, give them an idea of what family life is like and the, uh, you know, and, uh, that kind of thing A: but, uh, A: The AIDS issue is, is a bit of a problem. A: I guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem, is, is the financial end. A: And how can a country stand to, uh, spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem, uh, A: but, then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the, the knowledge, or at least the, the rumor, I'm not really sure if it's true or not, that, uh, we're not spending as much per, let's say, afflicted person on cancer. A: Uh, there's some, uh, A: take breast cancer, for instance. A: It seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more many more people than AIDS. A: And yet, uh, more people die of it, A: and yet the funding has already, uh, exceeded, A: AIDS has more money than, uh, breast cancer B: Than, B: well, that's interesting, isn't it, B: yeah. A: So, uh, A: I mean, if it's true. A: I, I've, I've always heard these things. A: I've never bothered to dig it out and make sure, A: but, uh, I've heard it on more than one documentary that, uh, they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and, uh, A: it's just one big P R campaign that, A: yeah, A: we think that's the world's worst thing A: so let's give money to AIDS. A: And yet we've had breast cancer problems for years. B: Right. A: And, it's just A: one of those, uh, course, one of the shows I saw was taking it from the angle that, since it doesn't effect men, it's not going to get funded. A: And, uh, having thought about that for a while, B: What did you think about that idea? A: Well, I, I kind of, I thought, well, that, that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing. A: But then I got, I got to thinking, the, the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate A: and there's only one test that just recently got developed, uh, a blood antigen, uh, antibody test for the antigen in the blood A: and that's fairly recent. A: And yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years. B: They've not really given it attention either, B: yeah. A: So it's not really cured, A: yeah, A: it's not, uh, not that heavily funded either A: and then that seems to be one of the, the major, uh, problems that men have in the realm of cancer, A: so, I don't know. A: I, I guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to. Uh, be it through different organizations, March of Dimes type, uh, telethons or, or bicycle rides or whatever, how they fund whatever, uh, illness they wish. B: Right. A: It's kind of hard to, to get an even keel on that. A: I mean, it's really hard to say, A: well, there's, you know, a hundred thousand per year affected by this one A: so let's give it this amount, A: and then this other one's only a tenth of that, A: so give it a tenth of that and, and just keep doling it out that way A: or, B: Well, I'm, I'm glad I'm not the one that's, that's in charge of, of making those decisions. B: They, uh, you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious, you know. B: I mean it's not so serious, I guess, until it affects your family B: and then all of a sudden it's the most important thing. A: Right. B: So I, I would hate to have that responsibility just personally B: but, but then, again, we really, we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address B: I, uh, I guess I, it, it frightens me to think of so many people with, with AIDS and with cancer B: and many of those things, uh, if they're not able to, to be insured then the country's going to pay for it one way or the other. Whether it's through prevention or, or treatment or, you know, just, uh, just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves. A: Right. B: It seems like one way or the other we're going to end up paying for it. A: That's true. B: But A: You know the, the other thought that I had, uh, A: I've had several minutes to think about this after I, uh, A: while I was finding people, I, uh, I could think about the topic longer that the person that receives it, A: so it's kind of a, a typo: that for than unfair advantage, as it were, A: but, the other thing that I thought of on this is, I wonder if there isn't enough money, uh, in our economy or in our system. A: Uh, it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good. A: I mean, yeah, A: they're kind of nice. A: But, we have such an affluent society , society that I wonder if, if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a, a cure for just about everything. B: Just change our A: Of course, then we wouldn't have any room to put people, A: but that's B: Right, B: just change our priorities a little bit. A: Yeah. A: You know, you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza A: or you hear these, these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this, that or the other A: and then you have all the arts
