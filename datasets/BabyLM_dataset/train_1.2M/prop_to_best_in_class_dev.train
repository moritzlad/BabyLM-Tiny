And you've got to have don't know He's talking about promotions and a new edition of the project engineering and he says I'll have to check with it'll be nice well we can count the panelling that we've got left over there, how many do we use a day? To be honest I can't remember, I know my lot on the last thing Wigan was doing two hundred and thirty an hour, so twelve times twenty, two hundred and thirty If we allow two hundred Well thanks a lot Bill, bye interviews Mm, two and a half thousand then an hour that's a box that's only a hundred interview forms an hour isn't it? Of course, yeah, because there's two on a sheet And that's allowing for spares as well, cos my sites aren't gonna be busy enough to do that, that many anyway I wouldn't of thought, so what you doing twelve hundred a day? Mhm, it's, isn't there two and a half in a box? Is it? I don't know Have we got one over there? So that's three thousand six hundred so if I add four thousand, three and a half to four thousand Mm, mm I'd be well in the clear then two, there's two and a half nine and a half boxes over here And how many's in a box? There's no lid on it so I can't tell Oh erm Is there no lids on them at all? No so there's two and a half thousand so there's five thousand interviews we could do five thousand interviews with that? Hang on there's gotta be something wrong there, that means I'm only gonna need a box at the most, doesn't it, hang on, let's write it out Start at the very beginning, there's two and a half thousand That's allowed , the maximum that we could do is two hundred interviews an hour Yeah okay would you agree with that? which is a hundred forms Would you agree? Mm, mm Two hundred interviews per hour, equals one hundred interview sheets there's been some very good cases of sexual harassment lately and Mm they're getting millions in compensation Check the information with you erm, so I don't even know what they are er I'm not sure if I didn't You know when people talk about you and they don't actually ask you they just mention things and hated Is anybody talking about me? so that's Sorry, right two thousand for Excuse me Yes mate did I ask you to bring no only the red boxes, I thought they were already done Only the red boxes, what, what were the red boxes? Well, erm which I've sorted this morning right have you sorted them, right, so you've done, what are these things? Don't know with them Don't know what Scott's already archived but why they weren't put in boxes away somewhere I've no idea These meant to be archived are they? Well or at least sorted, maybe they're the ones that was supposed to be left out for future reference. I thought they'd already been done I, produced a list of what's already inside here, er, these calculate are the files registered, they're not numbered so they wouldn't be registered, but they would surely So Rob's instruction was that he put them in those files and I didn't think it was a particularly good idea because everything's easier to find if it's in the envelopes that we've put them in. Now here, he's put down the interview date that was here, yeah he was starting to transfer the interview days across and I This is er I stopped him, I said don't do that leave them in the envelopes and mark them as they are, so what We, actually I think we stopped him doing that because we put information on the envelopes as well which he didn't see Yeah we divided them all up, but if me or Jan needed to refer to anything we'd recognize the information that we've put on the envelopes quicker than we'll recognize the stuff that he's put in there We realized too late anyway before we Is he, did, he's labelled this wrong anyway, he's called this interviewed date for data fifty three, but it isn't interview data, it's count data oh Wigan do you If you put it with that pile of envelopes Mike can you sort that out cos that is Wigan and if you leave them in the pile fair enough and I think they can go to archive, but please can you re-title the contents page and the pages cos they're not interview data it's count data, er I would of thought by now Scott knew the difference between interview and account Why he's never done an interview Well to be fair you're right, but I would of thought someone Well he told me he'd gone for a count sorry He said he'd gone for a count for a job Oh it's a good job we've got one wit in the team, I wonder where he is? Posy, er right where are we? Two hundred interview per hour equals four hundred and three sheets three thousand Sixty three, seventy nine That's it no See again, he could of put some dates in so, I, this needs proper registering Yeah been on file well I've got another file that needs proper registering yeah, but again I should just get some of these checked, every content, you know that the heading Mm it, they look it hasn't done interviews unfortunately Right okay No, no, no, we only need a hundred sheets an hour Hello mm, mm and there's twelve hours so we'll only need a thousand and two hundred Mm, mm Which one is it? so call it half a box Mm, mm Wilf telephone call, Wilf telephone So I need one and a half boxes Mm, mm for, I'm gonna have them all in the boot of the car, at all times, so I'm gonna have two boxes please Mm, mm two boxes, er that's er ten whole boxes six thousand so right now you'll have so what did we just say for you? You need six thousands do you? Yeah divided by I'm not even sure, we don't even know his name so let's give you three Well my understand of control is is one at control that you can call back in or destroyed and be replaced by so the control copy should always be and I want two boxes we've already got four and a half boxes It's a very loose definition and one which so let's order two for us and that'll give us five and a half, six and a half boxes another half box spare but I mean there's spares in them anyway yeah but we never actually said anything to control, we only say what's wrong with the job and why, why people suddenly started saying we've got to go around marking what we should be doing is marking control, control Or doing nothing or doing nothing and say nothing to control Yeah we could possibly there's no guarantee which there can't be can there, and say it gets lost in the post then you're not gonna have it updated No no and automatically assumed that, if it's important even, even within our own little team No I'm sure your mum and dad will not find that and we should have systems whereby if you were what's more I'm convinced it and you can guarantee that you still a human error even though you know how to do it, and we cannot guarantee that you'll do it so it, so it is, the, it is very important that nobody takes anything off the shelf automatically assume Mind you no point in It does matter we really need to know whether to make necessary phone calls Right I'll make a note of yours I've put yours on separate sheet, have you seen it? The return return actually interview if I do effect all the Well you're all gonna have some with your timesheets You go and see Will then before we think about ordering it then No, I said we'll go round and tell, tell him what we've just worked out there, get him to say yes Yes and then you can give okay yes How many? Ask Tracey how, whether they order them by the box or whatever Where, does Tracey yeah Oh I thought if Tracey can get them it might be more reliable to get them from Tracey. Could you do me a favour? About the interview forms, what you want yeah No Could you down there? Which one? No do a couple please if you don't mind, because you might need a couple spare Hello can I speak to Bob please Have you used these things now Richard? Yes thank you no, why you volunteering? yeah You, you tell Bill what Well I don't, I don't really understand myself what it wants, so I'm not in a position to Erm, is that three eight one five oh no, no sorry that's the wrong extension, er have you any idea if anyone can get to alright, thank you er, no I'll come back shortly, what extension should I ask for first of all? Three eight double one, okay thank you very much, bye goes away, everything according to plan Why where is he? He's at Halford today and then he goes on his holidays for a bit Oh great Well he's off tomorrow anyway Don't we get a stand in? and now we're short of paper No, what the green stuff? No, there's nothing downstairs, well Steve said he had the lot, the last box Oh good god, it's about time they got their arses in gear and started doing something properly Yeah Yeah, there really is no excuse is there? I get I ge to be honest though erm half the problem's been I think that it's been spoiling off so much crap, you know when I was doing those little things no wonder we're going through such a lot of paper Yeah if it's doing that for everyone and there's a mountain of scrap paper in there It's the way you speak to pardon? It's the way you speak to it what the printer, oh don't you make me feel guilty, no I it's just stupid isn't it? It is how many pages you getting? I was having about four pages, three pages before, four pages in between each one, and another at the end as well At least I've cracked it I think I can get it to actually page properly until Vicky comes on Mm Remember that report the Oh you are kidding So er, yeah, it comes out tonight Alright then Yeah she's gonna fax me the advert up tomorrow, she's gonna buy it today erm just rung Grant up to see, I was gonna ask Jo to go out and buy a paper That's how they come then. Oh, I quite like those, dinky doo is that, is that all of them? Well, there's fifty two in there, that should be enough shouldn't it? I would of thought so yeah, oh you're doing alright then There's more in the cupboard if you want yeah, great, thanks for these, er yeah so I just rung, I was gonna get Jo to go out and get a, buy a paper Yeah because we've had no bloody calls have we, but it's like our Chronicle around here, it comes out tonight Oh yeah but, it'll be tomorrow when people are You are in tomorrow aren't you? No I'm not actually Nor am I, it's I've put these Oh I phoned Jan yeah, they're alright aren't they? Would you like to say two words Bab? I don't think er, they'd be very practical really to wear them packy bags would they? Erm Be a bit revealing wouldn't you think? shake your little on the cat walk as it were Right, did you ask Rob about the interviews on oh right What's the new one called? Dee, dee, do, do, da, da, or something no they've got another one now are getting with it? No, Graham, Graham, you know all about the M sixty three surveys don't you? right tell us about the M sixty three's surveys sweetheart, how many roadside interviews do you think we're gonna have to do? How many roadside interview sheets do you think we're going to need to order? How many other traffic cones ooh he's a little gem, he's gonna tell us all we need to know, but were too afraid to ask No Ah come on We've got only three data collection sites, haven't got more than that So what's that? What erm, what you calling a data collection site? Er a count or That I think is just counts Okay cos at the time this report was put together erm And very well I may say so Yes yes, it's, it's not bad Who did this, was it Martin? at all actually Is, is that the one I did now you do surprise me. Er moving swiftly along Yeah Oh yeah we didn't know we were doing interviews at this stage This is quite true but we do now yes Aye, Rob said there was about fifteen accounts out Yeah, what are all it might be I've got eleven My gosh, my life, sort of died and I thought there was more than that The blue and the pink are general timetable are they? No hang on, no, no, no, no No that's just the erm the blue is the cord on the cord is the cord on blue don't let that monkey anywhere near it, it'll rip it to pieces the pink is the gem card No that's the pink isn't it? Yeah that's along the road some of the blue is along the railway line Yeah and we could take the journey time or we could take the wheels of the tyres off We could have one of those things like in Saint Trinian's can't we? I've got it, I've got the laugh on record I thought you'd be you'd be rewinding that, if Mike had a listen to that oh dear Pure bliss it's got account on it Why what else do you want to know? Three, nine, three Graham coughed at three, nine, three on the counter I laughed Yes sorry laughed Right You know the two way interviews, I don't know if they're gonna be simultaneous No you can't do that, they ought to be on two separate days because people not Yeah go home the same day yeah that's right, I mean the D B T say there's gonna be extra difficulty because, but I don't think they realize that people are gonna say I'm not going that way because Balls to that, yeah you know you might you might catch the same person twice they've got to be on separate days they'll be well pissed off Well, you will well annoyed if they're using it to get to Which work and back which junction are we thinking of interviewing that I dunno, but the widening between six and nine Six and nine Stop sprawling yourself there, ah we're recording I'm enjoying myself we're recording for prosperity again are we? Oh, there's a word we haven't Prosperity used before it's one I've never heard of prosperity Which is south number? You're nosey aren't you? Yeah Fifteen, O seven Will before you disappear Quick question , we've just been doing What does prosperity mean? No a cross between a prostrate gland and Peter telephone call, Peter telephone. of economic wellbeing Right We've done a quick calculation of interview sheets that we think we, we need, I need two boxes for Caernarfon, Jan needs three, we've got four and a half boxes already, we were gonna order two just to be on the same safe, but we're just looking into erm whether we need, how many we need on the R S I's on the M sixty three cos we might as well order them all together, save won't they have sixty Can you go back and said what you said when the tape was switched on? Listen Yes so you definitely want my bilingual now Yes, well we decided that if they were bilingual they could still be used in there's no need to because we've got There's plenty left over I know but if we print bilingual ones Mm and we don't use them all up, they can be used can be used elsewhere anywhere Yeah elsewhere, okay that's right I'll go for that it won't be, it won't be wasted No, okay, well I'll sort that out with Kath then, so if I order two boxes of You're gonna show me these things before you get Kath to print them aren't you? Oh god, yeah. Mm Okay So we worked out the maximum we're gonna do is probably two hundred interviews an hour, that's really over estimating Mm yeah that's the limit that, that's the most we ever did in Wigan wasn't it? No it was two hundred and thirty Oh was it? Yeah, but that was just on well I think, I mean all we only, I don't think we've got to two hundred on any other. So we've said that, so that's a hundred interview sheets twelve hours in a day usually, unless your name's Billy, twelve hours in a, half a day, should of said, so that's twelve hundred times two two thousand four hundred so that's half a box, call it two and a half thousand Five thousand in a box, no, oh I see let's half a box, yeah that's right so you want two boxes? Yeah Yeah, well that's fi , that's gonna be plenty isn't it? And we've got four and a half already Yeah so I just want two boxes of bilinguals So so we've got three now, so we got, sorry we've got four and a half We've got four and a half yeah so if we get two, we've got six and a half? Yeah, correct And we need two, three, four, five We only need five six, seven including him Well depending on how many of them, we haven't Oh right, no, you said to order for Leek and Caernarfon Oh beg your pardon, right, sorry okay, alright, Well so if you just go for the two you're a fleet driver aren't you Will? Fleet driver? You've got a company car? Yes Do you have your fleet insurance put on I might Because I need to photocopy it to send to yeah, I think it's either in my briefcase, or it's in the car, but it's probably in the briefcase, I'll go and have a look Okay, so tomorrow erm I will do you a mock up for a, a bilingual one Yeah great okay Tell me why isn't that phone hot? Why? Well weren't you expecting phone calls today? I've just rung up to see, I was gonna ask Jo to nip out and get me a cake and see if the advert was in, but it do it doesn't actually come out, it's like the local Chronicle here, it comes out on a Thursday night Ah, right, so it hits the shops tomorrow so I'm off tomorrow so I'll tell to put them all through to you, is that okay? Just gonna go and fill in a ha You can have a look in insurance now, I'll be grateful Super I do think I push me luck a little bit oh he's alright Mine's not printing Why not printing? Suddenly decided not to page properly No unless It suddenly says hang on, I'm not wasting enough paper, let's shove a few blanks through, fires more blanks than the T A that thing. No it means someone's stopped a program, stopped a printout half way through and it doesn't clear the page in Oh is it spilling, spilling off is it? Mm, well no, I mean this morning this one came out nice Yeah I've spent ages getting it so that it would er, you know, right Yeah and now page number is sort of out there Something, something happens when people send a different program through and they don't reset it I've tried resetting it and it didn't work No I mean stop the printout and recall, reprint out and set it up Hello Scooby's phone on the computer no, no, no, no he's not over there, I mean put it back through to her's, he's on the computer yeah, yeah, did you want the spiral binder before?

Confused, you will be you thought it was a co , important call as well didn't you? It was Kate When Scott due back?

Get a school-ey, get a school-ey in I wouldn't mind a school-ey a couple of months ago Oh, he was atrocious, what was his name? Steven was his name? No Yes it is Was it Steven?

Macouly Katkin I say Macaukin is right Macaukin, Macouly Macaukin Mm, mm Sounds like you're saying you caught me sulking or something like that no have you not seen it, he was in Inspector Morse as well. Oh He was one of the posh yeah with the, yes, he was With blonde hair And big jug ears Yeah, I think he looks like Macouly He was murdered last Yeah he should of been murdered first he was awful Aye he was getting on me wick U G L Y you ain't got no alibi He's in something else isn't he? He was on last night wasn't he in something else? I think he was I can't remember seeing him Yeah you did out of so many programmes last week Yeah and I shouted Mike, I said quick it's him It's him, da, da, da, Cannonball Run No I didn't see The Bill Did you see a, the holiday programme when they picked the winner of that holiday the serves her right didn't perform a greenbelt function. Whereas previously you thought they did? That was presumably the District Council's view at that time, yes. What was your own view? Well it's difficult for me to say because I wasn't involved with the at that time. Most convenient for you. How can you be sure that any future development of these sites would not have a deleterious effect on the conservation area, the listed buildings, the archaeology and the natural history? Well it's not impossible that er that that developments er can take place erm without erm without having some effects , but what what I'm basically saying is that erm it it er it wouldn't be a serious effect acceptable in normal planning terms. And you have great shortage of I'm sorry ,o o one moment. I think there was an extra Wasn't there a a negative in that sentence which crept in unnecessarily? Could could you just say it again, Mr ? I I you said, It's not impossible. I don't think you meant that did you? Can you just sa Just say it again and let me see if I've got it I've got it right. Yes. Erm I personally sir did not detect any double negative there. Erm I think Maybe . Mr , er I as so far as I got ,Not impossible for development to occur with these constraints . It's not impossible for development to take place even with these constraints. Yes. Yes That's what you Yes. I don't know whether that's precisely what you said, but that's what the intention was . Yes. I suggest that that is the meaning I got, Mr . It is a matter of degree isn't it Mr ? There is a possibility then. You think that there's equally a possibility that damage might be minimized? Yes. How great is your need for additional building land at Skelton? As I said in m in my proof, er sufficient land has been identified in the in the Local Plan period. It is not We're not proposing that these sites should be allocated for development. Has your Council determined any policy with regard to the period after two thousand and six, in relation to the current plan? In terms of. In terms of building development. We haven't, no we haven't we As I said, no calculations have been carried out . Do sites exist elsewhere in your area Mr that are not so encumbered about by ancient history, natural history, conservation areas,which might equally form a strategic reserve for your undefined post-two thousand and six requirement? There may be. Then why do you plump for one which has these impediments? To look at it from that point of view. Well as I've s as I've said earlier, erm what we're basically saying is that because these erm sites do not perform a greenbelt function and er they then fall into a white land situation, that that white land is a is an area of land that becomes er at the end of the plan period in two thousand and six, er they are areas which could be considered development. But you're looking at this from an inset point of view aren't you? You have gone along with the County Council,they want to move what they conceive to be an inset boundary. I dispute that . It's an inset problem, and therefore one is looking inevitably at the reasons for which you can moved an inset boundary, supposing that one already exists, which it doesn't, but let us suppose it does. The reasons for moving are relevant. Well the question as far as inset er is concerned, we've we've already touched on this morning and I believe it was discussed yesterday. Erm the decision to inset the village of Skelton erm has ha h has been taken by the authority,the er the consideration and assessment of where the boundaries of the inset should lie erm is what we're considering today. Yes, and the move is proposed to include land which is not at present built on. That's true yeah. And the reason permitted reason under Policy E Ten, the oldest statutory policy governing the movement of boundaries of insets, is the existence of a need for that . Well I think I I think you're getting into the into the wrong argument . However, you do recognize that Policy E Ten and its requirement for proof of need is important in regard to the boundaries of insets? Well I I . Have you pushed out a boundary from the point of view of strategic requirements after two thousand and six anywhere else in your area? Not that I'm aware of, no. So Skelton is immensely favoured, looked at from your point of view? It's a other sites erm w would come into consideration at that at that time erm in the long term . It's not been the principle er reason for for excluding sites from the greenbelt. You say, Mr , that the constraints to which I've already referred may well act as a deterrent er to potential developers? That's true. Do you think it would be a good idea to privatize planning control in the sense of letting it be up to developers to choose whether they should go ahead or not on the basis of what they conceive to be constraints, or that that should be within the entire realm of the local planning authority? I was simply making a comment at your your suggestions about the likelihood of development of the site. Er Mr , I I I have many matter to consider in my report, so I let's not widen it even further into this rather wider philosophical matter. Certainly sir. There is however one er overriding point here Mr . That is, you recognize, do you not, that greenbelt protection includes the concept of the initial negative presumption that is not contained in any other area of planning ? . Thank you very much. . Yes, can I just be clear er Mr . You say as I understand it that er the possible er use of this land as a strategic reserve is not the main reason er for excluding it from the greenbelt. Is it a reason? Did it form any part of the Council's ? I would think not. Well, I I need to be sure on this. Er are you saying that it is any part of the Council's case that this land th it it's it is er a possibility that having this land as a strategic reserve er can er is of assistance, or are you saying that it is simply er having included it in, it might form part of a strategic reserve? Er er er two rather different approaches . Yes,. I asked Mrs a question about the appropriate approach that I should make to this site in her opinion. I don't know if you I hope you remember that question, it was rather a long one. I hope you remember even more her answer to it, because the question is,Do you agree with it? I think you'll have to re have to repeat the question . Oh dear. . Right, let me see if I can get it the same. I do recall something of it now, but I can't details. Well, the point was as I recollect it, er that my understanding as far as the County Council's case was concerned, was that er the village was not inset for E Ten purposes, it was inset to recognize what the County perceived as the physical reality of this being a substantial built-up area which fulfilled no greenbelt functions. And the the question before them, and therefore before me in r considering the objections, is whether or not these sites are part of the general extent of greenbelt around the village, or are a part of this village er which does not as a whole perform a greenbelt function, and that's what I'm looking at when I make my site visit. Yes. I'm sure that wasn't the same wording . but I hope it was the the gist of it, and I'm sure someone will correct me if I've got it wrong. Er i i i er Now do you agree with Mrs 's answer ? Yes , I do. Good. Right I've got no questions for you Mr , thank you very much. Case for the District, sir. Thank you very much. . Currently sir erm I I do propose Mrs . Yes. sir, firstly because there is a slight divergence on matters of approach, and secondly sir to deal with the factual matters. Right. What what I propose not to do is to ask Mrs to read her summary. Right. C can I just be clear though er Mr . If er Mr or I wish to ask questions on the original proof or about what what the witness is telling you,. Mrs , first of all can I invite you to look at your appendix number five? Er sir these are matters which arise out of the questions you last asked . Mrs , what the local authority excluding D thirty nine and D forty of course is a matter for them. Can you assist us on the approach which you have adopted in terms not only of greenbelt function, but of the need for a strategic reserve? Yes. Er the the basis of the erm objection er and erm justify long-term development needs not just in total, but by recognizing making a major contribution to total land use but also . Erm that was the the written basis of the objection. Erm it's also clear from correspondence I had meetings with officers of both councils following those objections, erm at which we talked specifically about the greenbelt functions of this . So both items were certainly er lodged. Yes. Both both aspects were lodged. I can't say you know where the balance erm council authority . Er and can we in fact see your views as to the strategic reserve set out fully on page two of that particular ? Yes. yes in that they're ex expanding . Thank you. The second matter I wi wish to raise with you a arises out of Mr 's appendix two,and in particular paragraph twelve. Right. Could you just give us a moment to find that? Of course yes. Thank you. Appendix two, paragraph twelve. it's the inspector's letter of September nineteen ninety . Yes, right. Thank you. We know from the appearances that you were present at that enquiry . I did. If we then look at paragraph five, that's the first page of appendix two,we see here The appeal site has a long planning history. It lies within an area designated as planning permission since nineteen sixty four . Yes. I don't know whether it would be helpful, sir, if Mrs could indicate on the plan recently handed in to you Yes. where that nineteen sixty four planning permission Right. lies. Erm That would be helpful. Perha perhaps if I the appeal site wedge with the erm intending to build a road through it. The nineteen sixty four application . . Er let me just say that aloud . haven't got the plan in What has just been pointed out to me is that the er smaller site, that is the one with Oakwood on it, which I'm sure is familiar to er anybody present, that's just opposite Skelton Manor and Court, and the larger site was the land to the east of Oakwood incorporating this much larger pond w with what appears to be an island in it, er running right up to the boundary of the conservation area, I think. Yes. Yes. Yes. Now bearing those those facts in mind, can we look at what paragraph twelve tells us? Several local objections state that the planning applications for the dwelling at the northern end of the site and the Council implied that they would they would reconsider applications which site. Just pausing there for a moment, can you point out to Mr Inspector where that er building was to be developed,Mrs ? Yes, the the erm A as I've just explained, the the appeal site on that occasion was the the smaller enclosure, Yes. erm now now including Oakwood. The Council at before the enquiry and during the enquiry erm suggested that a better site for the development would be within erm the larger earlier site, erm specifically at the extrusion the northern corner or northeasterly corner, where I erm where I've marked . Er just be just below the track? Yes. Er is that it? Yes. Yes. Yes. Right right in right in the top corner, erm the furthest possible point away from the village. And paragraph twelve, erm towards the the middle, erm you can see the sentence in paragraph twelve To my mind, these sites , which were in that top corner lie well beyond the present I'm so sorry . C before we just Sorry interrupt. Just so that we can get the erm that sentence in context. That that was what was being put forward by the planning authority, then in the next sentence we have Most of the suggested sites are included in the conservation area in the village, and are separated from the built-up part of the village . That's sites in the plural. Yes. Again, where were they? Er along the northern boundary. Er in in the in the vicinity of the corner that I've marked with a star. A a and then we have the sentence which you were just reading. Can you read it out again? Yes. To my mind, these sites lie well beyond the present built-up limits of Skelton, and land to the east, north, and west has a strongly rural character. Er in i in the light of your understanding of where those particular sites the objection sites were, how do you interpret that sentence? Well th th I I'm I'm quite clear in my mind that the areas that the Inspector was considering then were areas beyond the track, to the north of the , outside even the greenbelt boundary presently proposed by the two councils . . I I'm not clear still. He he says he he mentions three directions, east, north and west. West would appear to suggest D thirty nine. . I I see. it's the usual problem whe when the site is not aligned with the points of the compass. . That's right sir. It's a problem everyone writing decision letters finds, and erm it does seem to be a problem. Well first can I can I say this. The the erm a great deal of time at that enquiry was taken up with the alternative sites proposed by the Council erm and their suitability in relation to the . And we were looking at how this top corner of the map related to the surrounding that those those erm reference points east north and west do relate to the open land outside of that . Thank you. Thank you very much . Mr please. Mrs , would you be so kind as to ? Yes. So that was indeed an location. It was suggested by the erm chairman of the then Southern Area Planning Committee. He wasn't giving evidence was he? He erm he wasn't giving evidence at the enquiry, but erm it was at his suggestion that I was asked to meet with the Chief Planning Officer prior to the to talk about alternative sites. And certainly, Mrs , D thirty nine is west of that site. And the inspector did mention west, didn't he? It's west of that site yes. It's a good a good long way west of the site which I've marked by a star . Yes. What importance do you attach, Mrs , to the observation of the District Council in relation to their erm District Development Plan which has for many years been used for development control, of the following text, which you quote in your paragraph three point six? In the case of Skelton O one moment please. Yes. Paragraph three point six of Mrs 's proof. In the case of Skelton, it has in the past ten years experienced significant residential development. It is not considered appropriate that Skelton should expand any further, and therefore it is included within the greenbelt. Now forgetting for a moment that last sentence which we're not concerned with just at this stage, would you agree with that conclusion of Ryedale District Council? It is it is it's a statement of fact that in the ten years preceding the time er when that comment was written, which was in the er mid-eightie mid-eighties, erm that had been the case, that's absolutely true. Erm whether And the District Council as you say clearly clearly considered it appropriate that it should not expand any further at that time. It's not a view that I particularly share but erm it was their view at the time. Would you have shared that view with them at that time? That It is not considered appropriate that Skelton should expand any further ? I can't answer that, because erm there's certainly nothing in the text of the plan to suggest why it was not considered appropriate, erm and I don't know erm I I can't instantly think what factors erm might have gone into that consideration. So I I don't I don't know what my answer would have been. Erm i it's a it's a very it's a very vague statement isn't it,It is not considered appropriate Skelton should should expand . Er er you deal with cases all round the York area. You would presumably have been aware that Skelton had undergone a tremendous expansion on its south side? It it's it's certainly er Yes it's certainly experienced . So let us look at the present day, and to take this wording, do you consider that it is now appropriate that Skelton should expand any further? I don't think I can answer the question in that form. Is it appropriate that it should expand? I I think there is certainly capacity erm for Skelton to expand, or I wouldn't be sitting here supporting erm the people I represent. Erm I think the the the two objection sites, D thirty nine and D forty, are suitable to a greater or lesser extent, physically suitable, for development. Whether Skelton needs to expand at the present moment is not for me to say. We're not saying, as you well know from my representations, we're not saying that these sites should be allocated for development now either in total or or in part, unless the Inspector feels that there is a shortage of housing land, that he needs to be looking for additional sites. What we're are saying is, There are the sites, they don't have the development constraints that I would to the extent erm that you believe erm they have, and Skelton and the two objection sites are very well located a whole range of service facilities and employment opportunities, and development on those sites would fit squarely within local plan policy. But I return to the point I make here, Mr , we're not saying that these sites should be allocated for development now, unless the Inspector . Two very comprehensive answers. Do you think that any other sites on the periphery of Skelton would allow for the requirement , however distant it may be, that you foresee, as well as or better than D thirty nine and D forty? No. And yet, other sites round Skelton might not have the same characteristics, with regard to environmental functions, in relation to the historic centre of Skelton, that these two have, mightn't they? That's possibly true. Erm proximity to areas of character isn't in itself a constraint to development. But in considering any possibility if development, would you agree Mrs that one must have regard to the suitability of one site versus another site in relation to damage which might be caused? Well I I refer you to the answer I've I've just given you. You're making an assumption that damage would be caused erm by the development of certain sites, and that it wouldn't be caused by the development of other sites. I don't accept that damage is inevitable. Would you be prepared to answer the question were it not related to Skelton? And if I were to put it, If you have an opportunity of two sites and the development of one is capable of causing damage to existing characteristics and the other is not, would you go for the the one which would not cause damage rather than the one which would, or would you willy-nilly plump for either? Well o well of course er one would go for the site which would erm, to follow your hypothetical question, not cause damage. The other sites erm or other site on the periphery of Skelton erm to which you drew my attention would have the potential if developed of causing a different sort of damage. Any any development has the potential to . I don't accept that is it necessary or even likely that it would that it would er The the damage which could occur by developing Skelton or expanding Skelton erm to the east or to the south would would be damage to to different aspects. Erm planning planning issues planning considerations. Erm so we do not erm immediately . Do you agree with the policy of the planning authorities that in general villages around York should not be expanded? That's a very sweeping statement. Yes it is. Er one has to exclude er for example, Strensall, where tremendous development is proposed. But as a general statement it has been made by the authorities. Do you agree with it? I I don't I don't agree with the the erm general proposition that erm the character of every village within six miles of York erm is an important element or component of the character of the city. I think that's far too sweeping a statement. But you know perfectly well that I support the new settlement strategy, and therefore in consequence I do support erm general limitations on the growth of settlements and expansion of settlements within the greenbelt. That's not to say that I I believe that the villages er some of the villages are incapable of of . Thank you, I am pleased to hear of your support for the principle of settlements which no doubt you'll agree with me would tend to safeguard settlements within the greenbelt. That's the the the very reason the new settlements strategy was accepted by the County Council after the County Council's initial opposition to it and their initial erm policy in favour of the substantial expansion of villages close to York. Indeed so Mrs . Now in your paragraph six point three you say It is not one of the functions of the York greenbelt to protect Skelton . It is however a function of Skelton to enhance the setting of York, isn't it? I I'm afraid I don't understand the question. Do you agree that the characteristics of Skelton as we have considered them this morning,make a contribution to the setting of the historic city of York? Very slightly. S I won't go into any attempt to quantify it, thank you. Have you any view Mrs as to the contribution which the road layout, the layout of the lanes, and the characteristics associated with those roads and lanes, make to the medieval centre of Skelton? Do I have any have any view? View as to the nature of the contribution made by the road layout to the characteristics of the centre of Skelton? The the the road network in the centre of the village erm is of historic origins. And the road network has dictated the pattern of development a around the roads,and that in turn has has helped to form the character of the village. So I I don't distinguish between the the buildings and the roads and say o one's important to the character and the other isn't. Nevertheless you do say, do you not, that it is reasonable for this enquiry to consider access to the site, to D thirty nine and D forty, in general terms? In indee indeed I do, because if the if I say to the Inspector that erm if he feels there is a need to identify additional areas for residential development near to York in the short term, then I need to tell him that there are no overriding constraints to the development of these sites. I put it to you that any alteration of Church Lane at any point between the A Nineteen and the centre of the village would be seriously detrimental to the existing character of that area. I don't agree with you. Erm the point that you put to me I think two or three questions ago wa was related as I understood it to the the alignment and the network of the lanes. Erm I accept that part of the character derives from the the wide verges, because that's reflect reflecting their physical appearance. Erm but in Their what? in large measure the character of the lanes erm or or the importance of the lanes is in their their pattern, their alignment, and the impact that that has had on the distribution of buildings and spaces along them. And I I don't see a limited widening of Church Lane to any access into either of these two sites, were that to be required by the Highway Authority,a as having any significant impact on the character of the village. Erm so at least you agree that some widening of Church Lane, at least as far as Spring Hill Lane if not further, would be necessary? No. Nothing like as far as Spring Hill Lane. Erm I think at at the at the very erm most it would be necessary to widen erm Church Lane as far as the western boundary of Spring Hill Farm. And as I've said in my evidence, erm we have had engineering drawings erm produced erm to demonstrate . You mean you'd bring that access in on that western boundary ? Yes. Yes. It it's an o it's an option. Yes ye yes, I realize these are options . it's an option that would work. No I understand all that yes . I d I . Erm I I me that that would have erm I believe very very limited erm a very limited impact on the village, Yes. and and no impact at all on on the central Mr has ve very vigorously explained his view that er you you can only inset for the purposes of E Ten. Wou would you go that far? If if I I think what I what I would like to say What what I think is that E Ten Erm it's very difficult to make this point, since it's an approved policy in an an approved structure plan, but I think E Ten's got it wrong. There've been several attempts to get E Ten right since nineteen eighty. Mm. But they've still got it wrong? Well I I I think that I think that's got to be right, because E Ten refers to where the need for development has been established, a nee a need for expansion's been established. Erm given that we're looking at a long-term greenbelt proposal and a comparatively relatively short-term Southern Ryedale Local Plan, erm I think it's very difficult to for anybody to establish a need now,i in the terms of implied under E Ten, which is going to perhaps erm not show itself erm for for twenty or twenty five years, in in terms of o of land allocation,la land requirement. Erm and I I just think th th the wording of policy E Ten is It it doesn't square with er national guidance for erm which requires areas to be left out of the greenbelt to provide for long-term development opportunities or development potential long-term development . Erm I've said previously in this enquiry that I don't agree with the County Council's erm notes on on E Ten, but really I I think that . Thank you. If anybody had any opportunity of getting E Ten right, it should be the Department which the Secretary of State to insert E Ten, because he is the highest authority in this . You're not asking me to to and there therefore therefore . merely to agree that the Secretary of State is always right. Right. Er I I'm sure he is but may not . Er sir, I I just have er one further point here. Eight point one four point four. Erm I'm much taken Mrs er by your reference to there being Lots of nooks and crannies where limited built development might go without causing harm to the character and setting of York . Mrs , finally, is this one of your nooks and crannies? No. Thank you. Sorry. I'll let you finish. That comment was made specifically in relation to the edge of the urban area of the city,a as I've . Mr ? I've no sir. . Oh yes, right. Er you say in your proof er Mrs that the site comprises two distinct parcels of land. Er are you referring there to the character of the land? Yes. Erm there appears . Yes. All of those? Yes. . and and from the the land beyond. Er site forty's simply ungrazed Yes. land ? Yes. Yes,. more and more . Yes. Right. Thank you. Erm as you travel up and down the A Nineteen,coming from the south er i er Skelton appears very well developed, Yes. quite close to the road. Coming from the north,er the appearance of the village is rather different I think because it is masked to an extent by the existing vegetation. That that's right. But the Yes. er you you made the the point erm earlier that the erm I think you said the objection site is higher than the Yes. site forty is higher than the road, which is which is perfectly true. Yes. But in fact parts of the village are higher than the road, and Yes, yes of course. it's always possible to see . Yes of course, yes yes. No I'm just trying to understand the implications of what might happen, supposing at some stage this land were developed . Right. So the site stands above the level of the road, and Yes. see whatever is on the site. This is correct? Yes. I thi I think Mrs mentioned the erm the the density of the existing vegetation along the A Nineteen Yes, yes. frontage . Yes , yes. Erm it's particularly dense as well along Yes. the northern boundary of of D forty, Yes. erm . Mm. But the the the corner, as as as you travel along the A Nineteen, the the corner, the the northwestern corner of of D forty Yes. and is very very heavily . Yes. Yes. And Obviously we'll be having a look at . And included within the site within within the joint site is the the belt of trees included poplar trees Yes. and also have a . Yes. Those poplar trees that actually occur on the boundary between D thirty nine and D forty,? That's right , yes. It but it's not just a row of poplar trees, it's it's quite a wide er mix . Yes, I see, yes. Yes. Right. . Yes, I'm not sure that I I'm going to at some stage. by a black line . . Oh yeah. Er yes, sorry. Sorry, yes. Right, thank you very much. No more questions Mrs , thank you. I I have only one point I would like to raise, Mrs , and this is whether or not er you are in a position to give me any comments er in relation to the er colony of Great Crested Newts in this pond. Or or is the only evidence before me that which er was given by Mr ? Erm I I I did this morning but I've handed it back to the District Council access to their newt report, which was referred to a couple of days ago. Erm I could perhaps get . If there's anything more which is going to ass er ass er assist me in understanding it, er I I I w would certainly find that helpful. I in particular, bearing in mind the point that er Mr i is making, that er newts seem to be as it were very choosy in where they er go, bearing in mind the existence of at least three other ponds in Skelton, I would like to know whe how er why it is or whether it is that newts are only found in this pond, and whether or not er the the survey has shown anything in either of er in any of the other ponds. But that is perhaps a matter which is best looked at er over lunch. Can I, before I adjourn the enquiry er for lunch, can I just raise one other matter which I would be grateful er for. I will raise it after consideration of er the Skelton issue er because it doesn't concern this in any way, but er I would like those concerned to consider the point. This concerns the question of written representations, er which I will be taking into account. As I'm sure er you are aware, many objections are being considered solely on written representation grounds. Er I asked before the enquiry, at the pre-enquiry meeting, that I should have such er any additional representations before the start of the enquiry. Inevitably, er that has not been entirely acceded to, and indeed to some extent er I can hardly be surprised as events move on during the course of the enquiry. However, it had been my intention, and still will be my intention unless I am persuaded very strongly to the contrary, that when I close the enquiry, which I hope will be next Wednesday, I will have in my hands all of the representations, that is to say, both any additional re representations by objectors and the Councils' replies, before I close the enquiry. The effect of that would be that I would receive no further written representations after that time. If either Council receive anything additional, it will be a matter for them to take them into account along with my report. My report will not take er th these into account. Now, bearing in mind the very short space of time between now and the close of the enquiry, I want to be sure that as far as objectors and the council are concerned, that this is a course of action which is both acceptable and practical as far as they are concerned. I don't want you to give me your answers now, I am as it were giving you the opportunity now, over lunch, to consider this matter. It concerns you I think Mrs , I believe you have a number of sites where you are acting for objectors where you wish to make er additional rep representations. If the course of action that I am suggesting and ind which is indeed consistent with the course of action I have been suggesting throughout this enquiry is to work, then I need I would suggest tomorrow is probably the absolute latest for me to get anything from you, and to give the Councils any opportunity whatsoever to make any reply to them. Certainly it would be most unsatisfactory if I was to get your comments on Wednesday, so that the Councils couldn't reply to them. That that would plainly simply not work. I think I've suggested the problem now, and now I'm going to leave the parties to think about would be a need for expansion, expansion involves built developm think I'll under the circumstances I'll give you er the the normal time, and I will adjourn now until two fifteen to have a chance to think about that. The enquiry's adjourned until two fifteen. it is now two fifteen I propose to continue. Er sir you raised a point about erm ponds a bit earlier, and I have obtained some That's right, yes information, That's right. er thanks to Mrs , er during the er luncheon recess. Er would you wish to hear that information? Good idea Mr . I was expecting that Mrs was going to tell us about it . You have the information then ? Er you you're thinking about ponds are you Mr ,n rather than newts are you?. Er I think that er er Triturus Crestatus and ponds er in our present consideration go together sir. Right, yes. Yes. Fine, thank you . And we must remember that we are not talking about any newts, we're talking about very special newts, Yes. the Great Crested, Yes. a protected species. Yes. Yes. And a moment ago I had in front of me the relevant paper. it's escaped me. .The erm the gist of it sir is that English Nature er carried out er last year a survey of ponds in this area, though we are not certain that they were able, owing to the exigences er created by the attitudes of certain landowners, er to erm investigate every pond in the area. I can however say that their conclusion with regard to the two other ponds at Skelton, which are mentioned in Ryedale policy E N V Eleven,that is to say the ponds near Wrights Manufactory and er that near the Barratt development , are apparently not found erm suitable er by the Great Crested Newt, and are inhabited largely by mallard. Erm I have already referred sir to the investigations which are proceeding with regard to the ability to erm, as it were, encourage er this er amphibian to go to other ponds, and I would again call your attention to the state of the knowledge we have at the present time, which is that that is not possible. Mr , does Mrs have anything to add Well i i i if we I think Mrs can er can assist. Could I just Right. recall her ? Yes, certainly, yes. It's alright, you can sit there Mrs , thank you. I I knew of the existence of this of this report went to the enquiry on this Tuesday by mistake, but I two You've read it? You've read it . two minutes ago. . Right. Erm and and that's why I thought I'd be more familiar with it. . Well I didn't know I'd got it . Well er no it's all right, we we've got it here now, so let's see what it has to say about it Mrs . Erm map one is a map of pond ponds surveyed in connection with the production of this report. Erm I don't know whether I haven't the erm Er just tell us what it says please. Er I I I Otherwise we're gonna have to go through the exercise you've been through of identifying the right ponds. It shows one two three four five six ponds er surveyed er in the area of Skelton. Erm two of the erm and it then in a table identifies Page twenty six? Yes, page twenty six. It lists two ponds erm in Skelton with erm a total estimated newt population of eighty. Which two ponds are they? Erm one at the Coach House and one at Church View. Er the Coach House one the one which we're talking about? Yes. Yes. Yes. And the other one sorry, was Church View? Church View. That that's somewhat towards the centre of the village. We we . The the report also erm interestingly erm said that two thirds of the ponds in the parish of Skelton were visited. Erm that's thirty one ponds. Virtually all of the rest remain unseen due to lack of permission. So erm if thirty one is two thirds,another fifteen or so ponds . There are some more ponds in in in erm Yes, yes,, that's fine. in Skelton. Er not all of them still existed, erm and three of the ponds, eleven o of the eleven ponds erm referred to in the erm three of them were in gardens.. These are ponds which contain newts, you say? The three ponds? Two of the garden ponds Great Crested Newts. And then there's a third pond where the report notes that Close access to Grange Farm was extremely difficult due to. So erm yes there are ponds in Skelton and erm two of them are . Yes, fine, thank you. Yes, thanks very much for that information. Yes, Mr ? Sir, I have found the note. Yes. There is just one further small item of information relating to the findings of English Nature. That I understand is that the lake at Skelton Hall is too deep to be found suitable by the Great Crested. Right, thank you very much. The only other question perhaps o on that one. Er Mrs , does the the pond within D thirty nine lie within er land owned by one of your various clients? Ye yes it it does, and I think I made this point in erm in my evidence that it lies at the extreme erm southeastern corner of the paddock erm and if if, This is making an assumption. On the assumption that newts spread out equally in all directions from the pond, erm part of their territory would be . Yes. The question I I have is quite a simple one, and that is I would like to actually see this pond slightly closer quarters than I've been able to. I've been round the whole periphery of D thirty nine er other than the southern side. Er is it possible for me to get closer? Yes. I I so I just go in to the paddock? Just go into into the paddock, yes. Wh where where is the entrance to ? That is that the entrance near the Coach House or or Yes. Ah. Thank you . . swimming. We've we've been issued with snorkel masks I should say . investigations so it will be quite thorough . I I can't I can't speak for th for the for the temper of the horses . Oh I see, oh well in that case w we we will view it .. from from the Coach House end, I think. It s it sounds safer. . Thank you . Thank you very much. Right, I think we move on then please. Mr , do you ? Yes sir. excuse me very briefly. Thank you. Sir, it's our submission and the evidence of what you have heard and what you will see, that the two sites proposed to be excluded from the greenbelt are functionally part of the village, and distinct from the land the open agricultural land to the north,and are visually a part of the village, unrelated to the open countryside to the north. Put another way sir, we say this. That when one approaches the village, in particular along the A Nineteen, which is the only public approach from the north, the objection sites read as part of the village and not part of the countryside. And there is a firm boundary between the objection sites and the countryside, in particular, the farm track to the north of D thirty nine. It follows, sir, in our submission, that neither of these sites performs a greenbelt function and therefore fall to be excluded from the greenbelt. To that extent sir, the submissions which we make are, I anticipate, common with those which will be made by both of the promoting authorities. Sir, if you do come to the view, however, that one or both of these sites may have some as it were residual greenbelt functions,then we ask you to bear in mind the matters raised, in particular Mrs 's appendix nine,about the need in the longer term, that is, beyond two thousand and six in particular , for a strategic reserve. And that is a matter sir which we invite you to weigh, if but only if, you come to the conclusion that these sites may have some greenbelt function. Sir, to that extent er er my case is additional to that of the promoting . Sir, the other matters which have been raised by Mr are essentially issues of development control,unrelated to the issues of greenbelt function. They sir will be considered, or may be considered, by the authority, but if they are sir, it will be in the context of concrete proposals and in the context of a forum which is appropriate to their discussion. And sir,a local plan enquiry, particularly where there is no specific allocation made, is not an appropriate forum to apply development control policies to a wholly unformulated proposal. Sir the mistake which underlies that part of Mr 's submission is a very common one ,and it is the assumption that greenbelt is, as it were, the residual category to prevent development which one might, for non-greenbelt reasons, not wish to see. For all those reasons sir, we invite you to report that these two fields should not remain in the greenbelt. Sir, those are my submissions. May I add er a valediction, in the true sense of the word. Sir, this is the last day as I understand it of the greenbelt enquiry. Y er the last day at which the County will be formally represented, yes. Er sir to that extent it is the last day of the enquiry. It certainly is sir the last day on which I shall be appearing at either of these enquiries. Sir, may I in particular you sir, thank you for the unfailing good humour with which you have conducted this enquiry. A and also sir, the courtesy which you have always shown to . And I can also say sir, I think without fear of contradiction,that of the hundreds of enquiries that I have done, this is the only enquiry sir which will have la left a lasting impression. . . Thank you Mr . Thank you Mr . Mr please. Sir, I don't propose to add anything. You you've heard that er the case between ourselves and er my learned friend on the left Mr are identical save in the one additional matter which he noted, and it's and I adopt his closing submission. Thank you very much. Mr please? I've nothing further to add, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Mr then please. Sir, as has been known in other cases before you, there have been many but what remains is the most important aspect of the whole , namely your visit to Skelton. Because it is on that occasion that you will already have, and will on your final visit, have made up your mind as to the nature of the northern part of the village of Skelton,the nature of the land immediately surrounding it,whether it be a paddock, or a small field,whether it be more associated in the minds of some with the open country, or in the minds of others with the village. An area which is at present not built on, which is open,which has had greenbelt protection since nineteen eighty,which it is now proposed should no longer have it. Which it is recognized will thereby lose the benefit of the initial negative presumption unique in planning . Whereby the task of the local planning authority, and the onus is on them without the initial negative presumption, the task before the local planning authority in refusing permission is made that much more difficult. And why should this task be laid on them? Two reasons have been suggested to you sir. went so far as to almost in writing as part of the reasoning for the proposed change by Ryedale. And that is a nebulous strategic reserve. No mention in the Greater York Study, no mention in any plan before us of what this reserve might be required for, or where it might be located. Only here has . Let's call it that. Sir, I invite you attach no importance at all to that ridiculous concept in relation to this highly important piece of land. And sir the other strand which we've heard a good deal about has been the nature of the vegetative screen which occurs between D thirty nine and D forty on the one hand, and land to the north of it on the other. Sir it would be a sad day if we determined matters of er greenbelt boundaries on the basis of relative screening . Hedges and trees are a normal part of the countryside. I need say no more. There is no dispute that that boundary is capable of being a suitable greenbelt boundary. But I believe from the written evidence that there is equally no dispute that the boundary which has existed for ten years, the tight boundary, is also capable of being a suitable greenbelt boundary if indeed there is to be an inset. When I say existed for ten years, er I I did make a slight mistake in that for ten years erm the village . However the reference has been made to the characteristics of that boundary, and although the authorities would prefer the characteristics of the one which they now propose, they do not say that the characteristics of the tight boundary are ones which are unacceptable . And therefore we come back to the nature of the land in relation to the contribution it makes to the character of Skelton. And to the consideration which you have had in other cases regarding the character of villages and the acceptance that they preserve the special character of historic York. There must be no doubt as to that conclusion. Very recently we have regard to the wildlife. Reference has been made to the . Sir, the pond in D thirty nine has been shown to be a breeding place for the Great Crested Newt,but it is also known that it migrates to other ponds,several others, but does not necessarily breed there, but chooses at Skelton. Sir I believe that you should not overlook the view of the inspector relating to the planning application within the grounds of Skelton Hall, when he made reference to land west of the site concerned. I have no doubt myself that in the expansion of land to the west, er D thirty nine, and possibly D forty would , and I think that his comment that development should not extend so far north is relevant. If indeed, therefore, this land performs a significant function with regard to the character of Skelton,one should have regard to what the effect on that character would be if development were , development of any kind. And I have already given you my opinion. It would be catastrophic. Mention has been made as to the nonexistence of an allocation for housing and as to the suitability of this forum for consideration of the effect which would take place of development with or without the existing allocation. Sir, I see no difference. One can make one's assumptions about the effect of development on a particular piece of land on the basis of the best information available to one at one time. One does not necessarily need an outline or a full planning application in order to do so. I'm quite clear that I do not need either an outline or a planning application in order to arrive at my conclusion that the effect of any development on these sites would be deleterious to the historic character of Skelton. Sir I commend to you the expert evidence relating to the historic character and I hope sir when you visit this site, although it may look very different at this moment from the way it would have done had you been able to visit it after the originally scheduled date of this enquiry, when the daffodils were out, I did visit it that day . I'm so pleased. I'm so pleased. . I believe that in all seasons of the year one would find that it had a most delightful character,. Thank you very much Mr . Well that concludes consideration of the Skelton topics. I would like to turn before adjourning the enquiry today, to the question of the treatment of the remaining written representations. Mr ,? Erm sir, yes. I mean we certainly have views on this er and er you have er encouraged us to express them. Sir er you hinted that er if there are to be further written representations you'd be looking to directing a cutoff date, and you hinted at I think tomorrow as being one possibility sir,so that you could leave this enquiry on Wednesday with all the papers you need and receive nothing more by way of written representation, evidence or any other documentation whatsoever. I put the suggestion . Sir, we certainly would welcome a cutoff date tomorrow. We're not sure whether any further written representation or representations or evidence of any kind are going to arrive which might concern us, but we can't discount that possibility. But sir we do have some doubts as to whether we would be able to respond to any that should arrive at, let us say, five o'clock tomorrow afternoon, by,let us say, close of play on Wednesday. Sir, that that provides a very very tight timetable, and up up to now, the ordinary timetable has been we had two weeks to respond to objections. Sir, we would Er my suggestion would be that if tomorrow were the cutoff date, that we be given the ordinary two weeks in which to respond. And what we would do in those circumstances sir is if the late objections er the objections or representations that were to arrive er up to let us say five o'clock tomorrow, we would er deal with and then send on to you with copies to the objector of course. Th there's there are two other points I I'd like to raise. That's my suggestion i i i i in that case. Sir, should any additional representations be sent directly to you after the close of the enquiry, I I I for one don't know whether this would happen or not, but what are the administrative arrangements for dealing with that? Er you mean er from objectors ? From objectors. Well they they will not. They er they they should not be received by me. Any which are sent to er , which of course would be the only way in which I could be contacted, Yes. er would be returned to the appropriate Council. Er . I I would receive nothing . Then they would be returned to us sir, and then if appropriate they would be dealt with in the context er of your report and the of the report . It would be a matter for the Council concerned to decide in er itself what it wanted to do with them. I'm I'm very grateful for that information sir. Thank you. Mr .? Yes sir. All I can say is this. We would urge you very strongly to er put a deadline er on receipt of er further objections by tomorrow sir but some of these proofs have been missing all of the discussion and they are literally months past their original fixture date. If any are received erm by the cutoff date, then it has to be my my submission that we have to have a reasonable time to respond. You don't need reminding sir that er Ryedale Tuesday and Wednesday, and Wednesday is a very very busy last day. My officers just cannot deal with these late proofs in days. Erm sir what I can tell you is this. In relation to every matter in respect of which there is an outstanding written , we have just about now prepared a general proof. It's not a rebuttal, although one tries to anticipate what objectors will say. And you will have all of those documents before you leave on Wednesday. But I cannot, and I don't think you'd be right to expect my officers to prepare detailed rebuttals. Goodness knows what will be in these late proofs, they appear to be taking months to prepare. Er we have to have a reasonable time to respond. Two weeks would seem reasonable. Now I don't know of course who else may be er wishing to comment. It may well As far as I know it's it is only Mrs er who has said, I I'm sorry to er to say this Mrs , you are the only person who has said that you wish to produce additional representations. It could be others are keeping quiet about this, I don't know. They may they're likely to miss the date altogether . Er what is the situation as far as you are concerned? Yes erm they're not they're not add additional representations, they're not additional to anything that I've said we've heard during the enquiry. Er they are outstanding matters which are to be dealt with . Erm I hear exactly what Mr says,. Erm in my experience it's quite normal for erm a period after the close of the enquiry to be erm given to erm the planning authority or authorities to on other matters which are outstanding at the close of the enquiry, whether it's two weeks, whether it's whether it's very very common, it's it's reasonable that the authority should have that opportunity to . Erm for my own part, I don't know . Er I would certainly find it very difficult to get my remaining written submissions to erm by five o'clock tomorrow . What you are suggesting then is that the time should be extended from five o'clock Friday to five o'clock Monday, er but that er there should be a period of two weeks after that er to for whichever council or councils are going to respond, for them to make . I I I mak making a general point. I'm not necessarily in connection with anything I might it's it's very common practice in my experience which seems to me very reasonable. Erm,again in my experience the a any additional material usually runs from the close of the enquiry, and I'm well aware of of the turning up at the end of the enquiry . Can I put to you, Mrs , my problems as an inspector on this, and perhaps then you'll understand you know why it is that I am trying to get this er all written material before the end of the enquiry. And that is quite simply that I of course need to read all of these documents. That's is obvious. But having read them, it is first of all possible that I may have some queries on them. It is possible that there may be for instance some appalling typographical gremlin er has crept in to something so that something makes a nonsense. I am not in a position to query that once I adjourn the enquiry. Er something else may be a through, erm,Au August anyway, we're definitely going in August to Southport and it might be a little bit cheaper for yourself than going all that way, it certainly won't, it certainly won't cost you as much to get there anyway No, well that's it int it?so er if things are reasonable we might just go away for a long weekend or something, go find us a place in Southport for a weekend Yeah but really I mean you need the odd week at home don't you really to sort of do bits to it, you can't work and do it Well I mean I'm not going away this year, but it's not really bothered me an awful lot No no so you can't gone to erm, oh I think I told you didn't I? Yeah Gone to Windsor today that's right and a day Eastbourne tomorrow, now that's a nice little break Mm just, just a few hours like that yeah see some places you see go from Friday to Monday don't they? That's alright, I think that's ideal Yeah I think it's a good time to spend in the garden to be honest, I mean you can't, you can't, it's not really long enough to try and do it at weekends, not if he wants to move that garage back, it'll probably take the best part of the week to sort that out Oh it will yeah, cos you've got to empty it and That's right move your swing haven't ya and yeah everything, yeah and prepare the ground Yeah I don't know whether that swing will end up going to the tip if it comes down, it's a bit rusty int it? Seen better days Just depends if the frame's strong Yeah you know you could always put a bit of paint on it mm to stop the rust, it just depends if it's strong enough to hold them, the frame mm, it's done well though, I mean You might, you might get a little something out of it for Michael Mm, we haven't got a seat on it Oh dear I don't know what happened to that one that granddad made Deana I know is John going to the tip with all this tree? Mm me broke as well Oh God it's alright having two, you never get two for twelve months Oh it's erm, it's not too bad this time of year, you can peg out, the legs come off it, you know that brown one that you bought me? Yeah I mean I've had it since, I remember getting, washing me nappies and putting them on there Oh I bought that one when Deana was a baby Yeah, it was before Deana was born was it before Deana was born? Yeah cos I remember, I was doing hang all me nappies out before she was born, so I washed them all and put them on Did ya? Yeah, so that was er,eleven years ago aren't ya? Yeah And it's been used constantly, so it's not done bad, it's the way, the leg's been wiggly for a while, it just broke off the other day, so, I don't know whether John can mend it, he couldn't seem to think he can No they're not er, I've got one that's got a rivet come out Mm on this side, you know where the little piece that, that bend, that you uncatch it to fold it up I know what you mean yeah the rivet's come out Yeah and that, I find that very awkward, I've got a rubber band round it at the moment yeah but you see that only lasts so long they, they perish yeah, done well, I might re come winter I'll probably replace it, I won't bother now it's not worth it with summer says she having a nice summer Yes, well, we're bound to have something aren't we? Well I should think so We're bound to have something We live in hope don't we? Yeah What are you doing? Mind you don't your tongue with that I tell you what they had in er Woolies market as well, I don't know whether you've seen them and I don't, I've not got you know an old Argos catalogue to compare prices, cos they've not got it in the summer one, but they have them in the winter ones, it's like a, a tool box, but it's on wheels and you make it up, you, you know all the screws and the wheels come out and you're not, it's all plastic, I think it must be from age three, because of the little bits, and it's like erm, I've seen it somewhere, where I've been, it has little figures sat in this erm, what would you, it's like erm, a bit like a truck, yeah, and it's got the, the figures in it I haven't I haven't actually seen one, but I once saw a lady on the bus with one if it, on the bus you can see it's quite a big thing isn't it? Yeah, yes Yeah on the box you can see it made up and then with all the bits and pieces separate Mm and I think it was something like, say twenty pound, it was on the market, but I have a feeling it was something like thirty odd Good boy, good boy, thank you, no we're not taking them out Ooh cheeky, you are cheeks all over your face I don't think you should be chewing that one Michael cos if you, if you open it up it'll stick on your tongue int it? Yes you think I can't see you just cos you're behind me. Trying to stick it onto your jumper You'd have laughed at him yesterday with his boo cos even John, you know, I mean, he heard him it was Yes as clear as anything, boo he says Yeah and boo again and then that was it, he co he wouldn't do it again It'll perhaps come all at once Yeah, he's, he's into ev oh it must've been about six or eight weeks ago he started saying a couple of things and I thought oh he's coming now, but it stopped I think I got excited when he started saying dark, but that's as far as it got, int it? Dark, is it dark? Dark. Is it dark not dark No he says it's not dark yet not dark not dark You're not fooling me Not fooling me do you mind mind you he does say mama now when he's moaning, it's definitely mama, he says now, if he wants something, mama, er, er, mama your skin Ow that's sharp , put it in there now please, put it in for mummy Yes, he knows it's funny yes, in there, in there, put it away Mine, mine That way they're saving money on a night out, they're gonna save on er actual depot hours, where it's like taking us sort of like ten and eleven hours, it's only gonna take them eight, nine to do that cos they're there, they're on top of the job. Mm, either way though, I mean the thing is if they do, you, you would be in for a little bit of something, if you hung it out till be, to being redundant Yeah, but I mean it's like, it's but having said that if ifs were ands, and ands were swings Yeah, then you I know, but John I mean you'd be up for a good couple of grand if you did stick it out. I don't know. You would Two grand's not everything Jane, you know that and I know that what, what I propose to do anyway if it's agreeable to you Hand it in and see what happens. give 'em a go, let's go and sit and listen to what the bloke says Mm and let him sit and listen to me mm he might turn round and say I'm sorry Mr you're not suitable, alright, I've not lost nothing mm you just had, you've just had a bloody, you've had a off work The thing is I mean if you turn round and just say to them well they're messing about with all the hours we've put it down to the erm Recession. recession, but it's just the, I think it's just a bloody good excuse to streamline a company that's Oh it is you know I mean they, they do don't they, they overstaff and then they've got to cut back. Look at look at Llandudno Mm. one of the factories, they're shutting it Yeah but and where're they moving it? It's going yeah, but when to Creda. when was it built all them factories it was built in the seventies when the boom was in I agree, I agree, yes I agree, that factory's old, it's out of date, it wants a lot of modifying so now there's so they've got it's just a good excuse to streamline yes all the staff. yeah, you see Creda now at are already making some of the washer driers, that Llandudno used to make. Mm, what gets me is how Creda they're gonna, they're, they're coming up in the pink and They've got job security Jane But why haven't Hotpoint, the original Hotpoint drivers, I mean Hotpoint is the bigger firm Yeah, but having saying that Hotpoint take over Creda Yeah where are all Hotpoint's drivers? it's like, yeah but it's like, it's like any big conglomeration int it, if, if I was to buy you out as a company you're gonna You'd have to keep me sweet you're, you're gonna say to him well there's conditions attached to this Mm I've, I've, those lads have served me well mm I want them looking after, and cou and you're gonna, I'm gonna say to you you're gonna go to your ordinary man I'm gonna say to you yeah, alright, I'm, I thank you you're thinking long-term, yeah I can do this and then when it, a gentleman's agreement and then it comes to paper, and when that paper's signed you're stuck with it Yeah and I tell you what, this is, this is what I think's happened Probably has, yeah. being truthful do you know what I think'll go next? What? Manchester? the double holiday pay Yeah I was thinking that actually and the profit sharing well the thing is they've I gone down anyway on the basic rate d'ya know they've, well this is it, the profit sharing and the holiday pay as you say they've yeah d'ya know the profit sharing's up to thirty one percent, thirty one hours up to now and there's another one, another one to go in yet Is that good or bad? I mean I don't know very much about It's better than what we had at Christmas How come? How come? I don't know, but they tell us that they're not flogging anything Mm, just a good excuse int it? so who's, who's who's telling porkies here? That is it John that's it thing I, I mean the thing that I can't understand you've, you've always been You know I've never, I've never batted an eyelid have I? No you've always done what they said alright everybody has I've always, I might've had a little moan, but I've always to myself Yeah, but everybody does, yeah but everybody has a, in your job John everybody's entitled to a bit of a moan I've never done it in the office, I've always gone, I've always probably gone in the canteen or in the of in the, in the wagon thing Mm. bleeding hell You don't have any time off and yet I'm being nailed mm and look what he said on Friday, I wanted on main lines he said, but you're not one of them and you're not getting a new motor Is that what he said to you you're Yeah not getting a new motor? that's what he turned round and told me. Did you ask him why? Well what can I say to him Jane, it's his property, he put, he gives the motors to who he wants, he's, he's the transport manager, I can't argue with him. I know, it's not fair though is it? I'm cutting these steaks in half John, cos we've got one fatty one and one that's alright. So I mean, if Jane, if it's such a good job why are all these people leaving? Oh Eh? Think of it like that Yeah I know why are these higher, you know Nick who used to be in Manchester? Doing the, the mail order Mm I saw him er he went didn't he? He went to Grangewell he's running Grange now he said d'ya know something For Hotpoint? Yeah, he said it's the best move I ever made he said getting out of here Manchester? yeah, he said it's the best move I ev he said I don't, the lads don't give me any trouble he says I'm fair with them and they're fair with me Mm and I told him about the, him taking the wagon off me, he said that's bloody stupid that cos Nick used to do my run, work it out for me mm he knew, if he, if he treated me right, I treated him right I'm telling ya, I've just had it up to there honest I told Dave this morning, he says well he says I can't, he, you're not losing anything, going and sitting and listening to the man No he said, he actually said, if it was m if I was in your position I'd go and have a listen mm see what the man's got to offer, it might be more but there again it might be less, but having saying that, it might be a lesser basic, but higher return If they can guarantee the overtime is it, who knows mm thing is, I mean you're like that aren't ya? I mean if you stick it out with Hotpoint and hope that the hours come back, if the hours come back you're gonna be earning a lot more money aren't ya? Yeah but you see if it's This is it I know ifs and ands I know I mean look at Colin Jane, he got it made at, at mm take your bed there, now I know that mm take your bed there, money in abundance, even in this recession, well yeah the work's there, no problem, he just got a big new contract for some oh not Federal, give me another big haulage contractor, oh I can't think, T N T T N T? you know T N T, Taylors Nightly Trunk Is that what it is? Yeah, it's either Taylors Nightly Trunk or Turners Nightly Trunk I'm not sure, seventy new trailers ten grand a piece Why did Colin leave? I don't think he wanted the er, I don't think he could hack the way Cartwrights work On the trailers? Well You, he's back to like labouring again weren't he really? Cartwrights are very funny people Int he trained up as a welder now? He's not a fully fledged welder Have you he's, he's welding yeah, but but they trained him didn't they? Yeah That other firm. but he's not So what was he wel was he welding at Cartwrights? He was making er legs for the Mm what they do, they're like a leg and and you have to weld them in no, this leg it's, it folds under Oh and what it is the box is stood there and then you back the motor under it and then you drop it onto the body and it folds Why didn't he like it? He said it was repetitive Boring? Yeah But the money was there This is it, take your bed there, Saturdays and Sundays and as many nights as you want now personally me, I'd have stuck that Yeah, for the money for the easy job, you set your stall out, you make a jig to sort it all out, you can slide it in, zip, zip, zip, done you could probably say what, three an hour out, if you're lucky, two and a half, three an hour under there now I could put up with that, but obviously Colin couldn't, but having saying that I feel, I, I think I learnt a lot from being bonus there Mm being on piecework there Was there, was it piecework then? Yeah to a degree, but not, not that bad if you know what I mean Let me go and see where Michael is, I've seemed to have lost him, he's very quiet Well, I tell you what we can have our tea out here I'm glad I had a word with Steve though Deana, do you think you could watch Michael please?

Yeah, but the one that I, it's got all her latest stuff on, is just called Cher that's the one I was after, but I don't want it now, I told ya It's a bit bloody late Oh you've not bought it have you? Told you not to John it's a lot of money. Shut up Which one did you get? Heart of Stone I've only ever seen one and the one that, the recent one is called just Cher and that's got all the last, the last few top ten hits on it. Can't you change it? listen to it first and see what you think. No I don't want to. Oh I'm sorry, but there was only that one which is all, it's got her latest stuff on it, I'm not really keen on anything else, it's got those last, you know the sort of her last few records of it, on it I should say I didn't know there was any others around, when I told you I wanted the Cher one, it was the one that was out now not the old ones. This one's out now . No, what I mean is er the new one sort of thing, the new Cher, it's in the top thirty, it was about number three a month about a month or so ago I didn't know there was anything else Well have this one and see what else develops listen to it, you might like it. Oh it's alright I'll change it John. Oh Yeah, but what did I tell ya? I told you not to bother Oh Jane for Christ sake stop it Yeah, but I did stop it . I told you what I wanted Pissing me off now you. It's no use getting in a huff about it there's erm Don't bother Jane don't bother Ah it's your favourite word that don't bother. there's no point in going on about it now is there? I said not to spend any money, I said just get a little box of chocolates, that was all, finish. Shut up and since when did you ever listen to me? It's not that I was worried about, it was just the money, it's a lot of money for something that, was an idea a couple of months ago. You really know how to cheer people up don't ya? I'm sorry I told ya and not only that I bought that camera the other week didn't I? What was Sandy saying to ya? What about? I don't know I wasn't there, you was talking to Sandy over the fence. She was asking what Steve had come up with job wise she said if ever I wanted a C V writing Graham'd do it for me Good idea won't be a bad idea mm, what I thought was the tough steak has turned out to be the, the one that's not I cut the steaks about a bit, one was a bit fattier than the other the one that I had I thought would be dead tough, is tender it's int it?they look more like a sirloin steak to me than a rump, even though it went under the name of rump it looked like you can only tell the shape of it can't, oh God D'ya want me to go? No, I put Who was that? Jane What she want? I don't know if you remember but ages ago, round about October time she borrowed some stuff for the Brownies, for erm, for Sian, Sian was going camping and she hadn't got shorts or anything, so she borrowed it off me, I was thinking of Stacey starting, I wanted the t I'm not bothered about the shorts, but I want the T-shirt and I'm just gonna get Stacey the culottes and she can wear her shorts and the cardigan with it buy, when she first starts and then we could, Deana's moving up to Guides this, so she can have that sweatshirt of er, I mean they're nine pound Mm. it's no good buying another one, she's not gonna need it in the summer is she? I've cooked these steaks too long, trying to get them brown. Will you do me a favour and keep the receipt and everything for that C D and the bag that it's in? Sandy must be having company, pulled the blind down I think that's why they've been good about the parking this week, cos I mean Irene's pulled her car, we saw Irene pull her car in was you here when she I saw her get in it, it must of been teatime yesterday No. she got in it, pulled it forward and put it in. Perhaps she's got the message. Hmm, I doubt it somehow and then Derek put his in and then Paul parked up where Eileen was Paul was waiting to get out So well Paul come out, I was talking to Steven and he said I come home last night and he said I couldn't park me bloody car up cos there were cars everywhere, and they were all theirs. Who said that, Paul? Mm. I didn't think he parked here last night. Well he was when I come home from work. What last night? Oh They were all theirs. was it? Yeah. Was that blue Escort there, the one that parked behind us? I've not seen him No, I was gonna say mm won't do him any harm getting a bit of a taste of his own medicine. Hmm I personally think he's seen the light about it. About time. We went and took Josh out didn't we? Give him a bit of a walk. You've been for a walk eh? Mm, we went in that, we went and got me barm cakes and a bit, a few veg and that, went, oh I bought Li Joanne a little set of er instead of an Easter egg, it's quite nice, I got it from that shop, you know erm next to Kingston and Hutch Oh yeah? er, what's it called er? Oh I call it the posh shop. Yeah, it's just like a select second shop in't it? Really, but er Yeah, but a hundred times dearer. but I mean some, yeah, but I mean the stuff is cheaper compared to what you pay to other shop What sort of it's nice it's just like, it's a sleeveless top, white, they had it in like lilac, jade and navy, erm and it's got, it's navy shorts with it Mm and like a big tie through the, the waist and the top is like white edge with navy and it's got like a sailor collar at the back oh lovely with like a navy stripe and erm an anchor on each side, it's quite nice cos she's got, I thought it would do for her holidays mm but the top she could wear with like, she's got, well it's only cotton you see, shorts are only cotton yeah but she's got some really smart erm navy shorts yeah that I thought this top would look nice to wear very nice this at night, it's a smart set rath er rather than in the day oh lovely so I'm just looking for er a T-shirt or something for Lisa no you can't have the pen it's too sharp yeah, you're crafty you are aren't you, you can get zips open now mm So when you going in to sign the contracts? Not heard anything yet Not heard anything yet Velma called on Monday, erm, because I rang her up on Sunday to tell her what was happening, cos I mean she didn't know it, we signed our contract and erm I said to her well if we get a date this week, I said could, cos she's going back to Wales tomorrow, she won't be back till after Easter No so I said could Mike go in and do the fencing you see at the side, to keep the dog out mm so,sh oh she said you, oh first of all she said you can go and get the key, so I said oh no I'm not bothered about the key I said if you could just leave the side gate open, so erm Has it got a lock then? yeah I think, I don't, she must lock it from the inside window back through Back out you see, so er anyway when we got off the phone Mike said yeah but what about bloody power you see Oh so, anyway, she must of thought about this, so she called on Monday, and she said oh I've been thinking Michael'll need electric for the drill mm so she said what I'll do she said is I'll leave the key to the garage under two bricks at the side of the garage mm she said and then he can use the power in there mm, mm so as long as we've got a date by Saturday he can go and do it, if we still haven't got a date he won't be able to go and do it you can't do anything we've got the fencing well no, no you can't Jane because you're not insured you see until no you actually exchange, as soon as you've exchanged contracts we've got to get insured you see but erm I mean on the letter we got from the solicitor on Saturday it said, it, it looks as though your purchaser's ready to exchange contracts in the forthcoming week mm so we've just wait and see. she's doing everything by the book I think, so Oh I've never even seen anything of her Jane no I really thought I would see her round Sale, I've never seen anything of her no but, erm it might of taken longer than what she thought as regards her London ends you see start again really, that's what it is mm well I think Dawn is quite happy now, I mean I think she felt as though she'd been rushed at first, but I mean mm that was her choice really that's right I mean she said to me on Monday something about, I mean it's her that wanted to be in, in, by the middle of March, now I never said the woman wanted to be in by March no we were just discussing it mm but, I, Miss never actually said well I no want to be in by the end of March no I think she just assumed because she was coming down here with her job she was ready to move in that she'll be ready to move in you see yeah but I said well at least you've got it all done, you don't have to rush around at the last minute. that's right. How much money did she make in the end on er garage thing? She didn't say and I, I never thought to ask her, no she didn't say so we're just, that's why really as I say I don't, I think at first she was quite happy for us to go in and maybe take stuff in, but I don't think she was happy about us doing structural things on it Mm cos I think her solicitor must of said something to her you see yeah but I mean even, even if we, if we get a date for next week Jane, we can't get in, cos I'm not going to get a key and go in when she's not there no if it'd happened a couple of weeks ago when she was about I would of kept going over like she said I could do yeah but we'll just leave it now yeah to the day you might as well er, we'll get it all sorted, you know what you like, you sit there and you think oh I want it, to get it all sorted before I go and move, it'll just have to be in a tip for a while. yeah, you can't though can ya? I mean you've got, it takes you so long to place things and No you don't this is it, we'll just dump everything, I said to Mark we'll just dump everything in the back room and we'll stay in the back room till we've sorted the front room mm out and then we'll move into the front room into the front room you've got Easter hopefully to go out and to sort out Well I hope so. your, your front room though I think you just want to get everything Well I think that's what it is Jane, but you can't tidy, but you know, you know in your own mind you can't you know in your own mind you can't no but and Creg's on Monday with the carpets , oh we shall have a right laugh with them two blokes, aye, they both go oh God not you again you know and do I have a have you thought of any that you like? Oh we do like that one in the window That's the that's the one Mike's mad on, and when I went in on, er that particular colour or a different colour? yeah it looks lovely in the square, yeah because I thought it was quite light, but it isn't actually It's the pinky one int it there it's erm, you shut up, no I went in, I've never been in Weeks, to go in and have a look and everything, it was Hamish that was in that time and you can have a right laugh with him, he's the one that came and sorted the hall and stairs Oh out for me and erm, when he went in on Monday, erm it was the other one the lad that actually owns it, so I was in there for about bloody half an hour and we came home with some samples and one that I quite liked it was up on the wall and he said that is my best selling Axminster that I had, and it was like, it was maybe it was a bit too busy, it was, it was greyey and it was all different other colours in it, but it was a lot of flowers on it, it wasn't a traditional Axminster you see Mike loves these traditional Axminsters and he doesn't really, he won't really entertain anything else, erm, anyway I brought that sample home and what else? Oh yeah that's the only one I brought home, on Tuesday it was, well as soon as he saw, I brought it in and me dad looked at it and he goes yeah it's alright, I knew he didn't like it and then when Mike got in, he said oh I don't like that, so I said why? Well you take it back I said and you pick the carpet Mm where's this for then? so, this is the front room The front room so er, he goes off and he comes back with three samples then, well one of them, it has been in the window as well, but it's a very definite diamondy shape More no quite big shaped diamond but it's in like pastel pink and pastel blue and it's very, very pastely colours Can't remember those but I would imagine down on a floor it would look very, the diamonds would be too much if you hit ya mm know wha what I mean, he brought that one home and he brought another quite nice traditional one, but it tended to be quite browny, and then another one and, er You're not ripping that up? and then you know the one that was in the window? Yeah He didn't bring a sample home of that cos he, he brought the same design but in a different colour, but it was more greeny mm so, anyway, I just, we've got it down on the floor and I says if we had a brown suite mm that would be ideal yeah even though there was a bit of grey in it, it was the, really the brown that predominated it, I said it, it, the grey suite wouldn't go with it so you're gonna have the front room with your grey suite in it? yeah then shall I You thought, have you thought of any colours for your back room? No, this is, you're thinking this is for your front room now your carpet? Yeah, er, well, so I brought the sample of that one home Mm the one that's in the window right it's the pink squares and it's the and, yeah, me and Joanne weren't very keen on any of the carpets either and as soon as she saw that she said oh that's lovely mm she said now I do like that, cos it looks nice and warm cos there's loads of colours in it, there's pink, there's burgundy, there's blue, green, every colour you can think of, you've bro oh, you're determined to have that you are, aren't ya? If he got a wouldn't do him any harm, but it wouldn't half make him go ah, cos it's dead minty what are ya? What are ya? Leave my handbag alone but you see when it was in the window Jane I thought it looked a bit too light, but I think what makes it look like that is they've got the light shining Yeah right on it I've seen it down Chris and I love it when you actually see it on the floor, it looks totally different Glenys has got it, very, very sim very, very similar, there's very, there's not a lot in it, I'll take those magazines off you see, oh Christ, erm but she got it in the greens yeah, well I, Mike says I brought that one home when we were looking for a hall instead, but I said no I said it was one very similar, but he said we couldn't have it because erm no with them being the squares you'd lose a hell of a lot coming down the stairs mm you know on the turn and everything it would spoil it I mean it would, you've got to have a big spread really haven't ya? yeah, yeah I mean I'd thought about it for ours But but I remember what you said about the squares yeah I'd like it in here yeah I really would it would go lovely with this I know because even though it's got all the colours hasn't it? even though this is erm not a plain, it's not dead busy is it? No If you know what I mean. but that, it's not, it doesn't, I don't see that carpet as being a particularly patterned car I know it has got a pattern It is it's a definite square, it's definite true, what your colours but to me I look at the, I call patterned carpets all the flowers and mm rounded patterns yeah d'ya know what I mean but yeah to me this is, a square doesn't look the same as the round no you know yeah I know it sounds stupid, but I like yeah I don't like the round no flowery carpets no er or the ones that have got leaves going into mm you know that sort you have yeah to me that's patterned yeah but that carpet that you're talking about to me is a plain yeah but it's a plain square. yeah, as I say Mike says, reckons I Liked it brought the green one home cos I brought the three samples home, the one that we've got down and another one and another one for the hall and stair, but I said I'm sure it wasn't the same as that, but it might have been, but I have to say he always said we would Mike said but you see the fortunate thing about it Jane, with that one, most of the carpets are only twelve foot wide mm which would mean, cos the room's thirteen foot wide oh is it? we would of had to Have another piece buy an extra five square yards yeah cos it was only twelve foot wide, anyway, they do that one in fifteen foot wide Oh do they? so it, we've got to have twenty one something square yards, I think he worked it out at Is it thirteen foot wide then the room? Yeah into the alcove Yeah the back room isn't, the back no room's only about eleven and a half, because you get the back room, the front room and then it goes in a bit right to the back room to the kitchen to the kitchen you see yeah. where it's So what's the length of the front room? Er fourteen ten, by It's bigger than what it looks really though it's bigger than what you think really I think it's deceiving because it's got such high ceilings yeah the high ceilings sort of seems to take it off with yeah I know it sounds silly, but perhaps if the ceilings was lower it would look big yeah, yeah higher that I think it's just maybe er how you have it as well mm I mean if you look at it now without the dining table yeah it looks totally different yeah I mean, Mike really likes that as a front room, he keeps saying that's gonna be our room, you know mm I like a front room he's, he's funny he does like a front room, so I thought well sod it, I hate picking carpets Jane, so I thought sod it he can pick yeah the carpet and if it's not right he can I don't think you can go wrong, far wrong with that one No, it is nice thinking of pink and grey in there yeah, and he wants to, he came home this morning and he said, he must of been thinking about it, and he said well we could emulsion the walls, he said erm, why don't we do an apricot white, I says well that's peach, I said the Yeah the carpet's pink yeah and, the suite it wouldn't, it wouldn't look right, I mean we have got apricot white on the walls in the back room now, but I said, he, I think he feels as though, a definite pink is not the right colour for a room, do you know what I mean? Mm And yet it, I was quite happy with it to be honest yeah Jane because I think it looks quite warm yeah, you can only put another colour into your curtains and bring it out with your carpet Yeah, well what I think he, I think he will emulsion over it cos I mean the ceiling's a bit, as you say she'd been a smoker mm and the ceiling in that front room is a very deep, deep pink I think, if I can remember rightly, I think we'll go over, we'll probably will go over it and yeah erm we're not gonna go mad knocking picture frames down in that room, it's too much of a big job Yes it is, innit? I'm just gonna put a border round it Mm seen like a border in perhaps like a bit of pink and bit of grey on it and it's like sort of scalloped edging Mm that'll look nice so put that over yeah at the top of the erm in of the picture frame yeah it sort of brings the ceiling down a little bit as well yeah cos to be honest, the more Mike goes over there, the more he keeps saying he doesn't really want to pull the picture frames down no well with them being such a tall ceilings, they're probably I don't know why, yeah and I think he feels as though you, he says well if you decorate it right you can blend it in with the wallpaper mm anyway you know, so of course you will. I don't know I see I think we'll So what will you paint the picture rails white? Same colour as the walls Yeah I think, so it just blends in with the border round yeah, it'll look nice and then it'll just, it'll just be titivated up really, so we can live in it and then the back room can just be done at our own time. I, I'll definitely have those curtains for you this weekend, I'm gonna get them done. Well as I say Jane Well then you can put them straight up then can't you? well no she's already got them up. Mm, well what are they like? Well they're not very nice, but I mean er I'll leave them up till I come to actually er get everything done Mm, no I meant when you've dec once you've, you know painted in there and got your carpet down Yeah the grey curtains would go with your suite wouldn't they? Oh they would match up with it yeah, yeah well I, okay then if you want I've been mean I've been, I would of done it last weekend, but, I don't, I had a load of washing and it depends Yeah, it is getting it all done you've gotta get up in the mood Jane, I did Saturday morning Mm it was fine, I thought right get up and get them bloody curtains washed, I had 'em on the line, but do you think our Mike noticed them, well when he came home from work, because I thought of having to put 'em back up again, I just Yeah got straight in from work oh and I had Mike ironing them while I was putting 'em up, I said right stand here and watch me hang this curtain, so I'm showing him how to iron it, so while I'm upstairs putting 'em up he's ironing He's ironing 'em, so I had 'em put back up again for quarter to six, That's alright that, I must have done six loads of washing, for some reason I just didn't seem to have enough to do me loads Yeah but then come Saturday morning it's all accumulated I had to, I was doing two what I call mid washes, this sort of colour yeah and then I was doing two these colours and I'd yeah got about three lots of er white it's unbelievable yeah, I've done that Jane you sort of look one day and you think there's hardly anything Stop it. there, I'll leave it Yeah and then you'll regret it the next day I know cos the bloody basket's full to the brim I'm determining to keep it, I'm just putting bits in now yeah but a white load's there that I must put in and must get that put out this afternoon mm but er, oh dear I wanted to get them down and me others up while John's been in mm cos I didn't want to have no curtains up on me front yeah so I shall definitely get him to give us a lift yeah with them. well as I say don't worry about it cos that first week I won't even bother anyway cos I'll leave up what I've got Yeah cos he said, you see I've, I think it's a picture, I think it's erm, what do you call it? A pelmet, I think right she's got wooden pelmets on everything Has she? so I'll want to take them down Yeah so they'll, that'll have to come down anyway yeah You see I hate choos that's another thing I hate choosing Jane Those windows are so big that you've got though, I mean I do I, they, they probably will fit, I think it will be a tight fit though They're twelve foot, I know that one in the front room is twelve foot wide, by seventy two drop Yeah, well I don't know there more than seventy two aren't they? Mm But erm, they only really just go in my bay yeah there's no, there's not a lot of gathering there at all, what? You're not having the pen cos like Joanne's bedroom I'd measured that, that's sixty six drop so I ended up getting seventy two drop curtains mm and Pam was gonna shorten them and then I said no I think I'll leave them yeah cos it was only like sort of eight inches difference and I thought well when I wash 'em they might shrink anyway mm and er, it'll, it'll Now Stacey, I remember, she used to, this is, must be mentioned within the bunk as well, cos I, for some reason I remember sitting her down on the chair to dress her by the bunk Yes. cos Deana used to have a chair by the bunk so she could climb down onto the chair, shut up Oh. and we always used to say what have you got? And she used to say a big head You rotten thing you, I know well Mike's potato head cos he has trouble getting things over his head, and especially off, it hurts more off than on don't it when er Yeah, it's easier to get them on int it? oh dear oh you've got plenty of ready for this, mm You've got nothing to play with it now. Me or Michael? Why, do you want some thing to play with? Don't don't oh what you doing? Oh better not put you off your food.

Ah doesn't matter, does she pluck them all over? They're like, I don't know, it's like they're really thin, and she's plucked 'em at the end as a kid. Oh god, I haven't really noticed. Look there's Amy, let's record her, hee hee. Right. Ooh. Ping. Oh, where d'you get it? Oh my cousin passed it on. Oh, I think they're waiting for us Eleni, it doesn't matter, bye. I'll just put it on pause now. What? What's wrong with Lucinda? Oh yeah she went to sign in, that's it. Did she? Yeah they're What? You're joking. You're kidding, that is it. Right excuse me. This is it, this is the truth right. Mrs S , tell me that again so it's on record. Say it again, say it again. She wants us to go to Mr . But who? Who's us? Me and you. And me. I'm going Well, oh, and you as well? And Lucinda? Is it recording? Yeah, you're recording. Am I? Hello everyone. Oh shut up. Oh this is really getting on my nerves. Well leave him then. You don't need to say anything to him, just No it's recording She reckons she owns the bloke. She doesn't reckon sh Yes she does. She doesn't. Oh well, I hate her anyway. Girls at the back of the room, we haven't come for a chat. Can we get out our worksheets, our , our rulers. We have to come for a chat, we need to record it. Yeah. Shut up. The last thing we taped, what was it? Oh I dunno. Well what was it? I have to know so I can log it. Oh thanks. What was it? I don't know. working to. Oh my god. What was the last thing we had, was it Del and that lot? Yeah something like that. No, just walking out of English. Was it? Yeah. Walking out of English?. Yeah. Well near the end of the lesson. When the lesson was ending. This is my homework. Can I give it to you Monday? Right, where's your book? Mrs, I haven't got my sheet. Look, I've done my homework. The sheet that I gave you. If you've lost these sheets erm, how many of you have lost their sheets. Well it's in my book, Oh, we've all lost our sheets, she's such a moany old cow. The homework, just copy it quickly. Miss, say hello to the microphone. Oh, you boring old cow. Chang a lang, do you wanna listen to us, aah. shall we do our section work as well? Ching, ching ching ching, ching ching . and go five kilometres south west to a point b, and then three kilometres south to a point c Boring. On what bearing must we sail to head directly back to harbour, and how far has it . I want an accurate scale drawing, using a scale of one centimetre. Now this is a really easy scale. It's not one to so many thousand, it's just written nice and easy for you, as one centimetre to one kilometre. We're in maths. Show A B and and find the bearing This is boring, I'll pause. let me have one. No Let me have one. Shut up. Who drew this? Me Yeah I know. Stupid cow. Oi did you tell Lynn about erm, Danny, thingy, Danny , yesterday, on the field. He, he pulled his erm trousers down and he was showing us his pants and stuff. And we were going, because he took his shirt off yeah, we were going . We were just taking the mickey. What you have to do is look at your T G and close your eyes. Oh, well, and not look at what your doing. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I Bye. work out east west, I'm just so bad. Hang on, I'll record your conversation. No way. Number three. Right, so how are we going to start? The boat leaves harbour A The boat leaves harbour A. How are we going to start by doing this Using tracing paper to mark the position shown by London, Boring. Oi, you can pause this, they don't want to hear the teacher. Oh sorry. Sorry. Oi does this Norwegian lady understand English, or is she studying English? Oh right mmm. What the hell are we doing? I do not know. Look, I need my book. Stop doing your homework. Say you didn't understand it or something. I dunno. Lynn, what do we have to do. Lynn, what do we have to do. No, we're going to be famous. Hi my name's Lucinda. Oh, You wish. Oi look. We've got it on a two two five bearing Oh god, we've supposed to, have you got a pencil? Miss, we haven't even got our protractor yet. Wait a sec. I did have a erm, protractor, but it broke. I know you did, it's very distressing that they break isn't it? Zoe. Who's done it? Right, where's two two five? nought six degrees twenty-five kilometres. Excuse me. Can I borrow the goddamn protractor? Go on, it's not on. it is on, you're a liar. I'm gonna sue you for a hundred thousand dollars honey. Put me in the oven and bake me for forty minutes. can I borrow the protractor? Yeah, gimme the ruler. Ching ching chung yer bum, to you boobs and go,diarrhoea mm diarrhoea . Lynn, shut up. I'm singing to myself. Oh, please. Finding the pressure on the ground, under my feet, is a very hard thing to do. Last week, Joanne wrote down the method of how to make a bridge. Whilst the rest of us were copying down the maths work . A car has four tyres, each of which tor touches two hundred centimetres square of ground. If the weight of the car is eight thousand somethings, find the pressure on the ground, under the tyres. We will use F equals S divided by A to find this out. Right, F equals eight thousand, A equals four times two hundred centimetres squared, equals eight hundred and ding a ding a ding a ding a ding a ding a ding a ding a boomsha Oh, alright then,you wanna know, ding ding ding ding ding ding ding a ding a ding a ding, ding ding ding a ding boomsha oh, oh . This is so boring. To Ali, if you listen to this, you're stupid. No, I'm only joking. If you listen to this, I'm gonna kill you. You don't mind do you? Nah, I didn't think you would. You're so gorgeous. Thanks for giving me this stuff. Oh, by the way, I I've broke the walkman, but you don't mind do you, I mean you're gonna fork out for it, but, I'm sure you don't mind. Are you having a fit? Oh listen to this. She's j got her asthma attack. I can't breathe. Miss is being a bit of a beep. Look, listen to me. Give me the protractor. give me the protractor. Isn't he? Maybe he's slightly western. Mad. See what I mean. South Carolina. She's erm, you know all this western crap, see what I mean. She's not western Yes she is. She is. I'm not, you're just an old liar. pinky boo boo. Oh. Oh I mean Lynn, you always cow's poo poo. They crack me up, they crack me up. We haven't got a sheet anyway. Lucinda Put it in the middle here. Alright, so you can see it. Centimetres is seventy-five. Seven point five isn't it? Not seventy-five. Oh, alright. Have you actually measured it on your diagram? What, which the distance Yeah, you're writing, or are you writing what somebody else has got? Oh, I was writing it from the board actually. Oh right, well you should have measured it. Oh right. Right, now we're way behind here, and I suspect it's because of a lot of chattering. Well, we've been waiting for the protractors, we haven't been cos like, they have to do it, and then they pass it on, and then it goes like that. Can you please have your own for Tuesday? Write in your homework diary. Protractor for Tuesday. Oh, when does the maths erm, shop open? I'm not sure. Isn't it Monday I don't know what, which day it is, but Monday we're not at school. Oh, right. Right, fine. Now have a look at this one here. Okay? Okay. That's right. Okay. Oh, isn't that just jolly good? Who's got my rubber? Zoe, give me the rubber. Zoe, give me the rubber. Oh what do you have to do after we've done Bam bam bam, chi chi chi. Is this on pause, I better be on pause. Oh my god, it isn't. Do you fancy, oi Zoe, do you still fancy Steven? No way. That's what you said last time. Oh, gonna show this to Peter now. That is it. That is it, I'm not your friend. Do you? Nah. It's just a little, insy winsy teeny . Sorry? Zo , like the side of a ten ton truck you do. I decided, yesterday, yesterday I stopped fancying him, but I changed my mind again. Oh. I fancied yesterday as well. Oh, I remember when you fancied him And he, didn't he ask you out or something? No. Didn't he? I though he did. Didn't you go out with him? No. You were always with him. jeans yesterday. What? You were always with him. Most of 'em. What? Oh, bloody hell, stick to pizza poof. The battery's running out, the battery's running out. It is. How d'you know? cos that little red light's flashing. We'll just we'll just bing bing bing bing bing. We'll just I gotta list the people. No say shring at it. Shring. forgotten data, see it any time eight ninety-nine on video Alright, we've gotta make a in class Oh Miss. When the fishing boat sails for three and a half hours unclear Steven, Steven. Oh, it's alright, I've forgot what I was gonna ask. Three and a half hours. Excuse me, oi, podgy, er cookie, erm,what's her name? Erm. mmm? Who? Aran. Aran? Mmm. What happened? Eh? Mmm nuffink. Fine. I hate the white hair. Which one? The one with white hair, up there? You hate her? No, I hate her hair. Oh, you hate her hair What do you think of Steven's hair? Steven's hair flies out at phew ptong. Looks like a mad professor. A what? Professor. A professor? For some reason, you two find it necessary to get up. Nobody else, now sit down. You don't get out of your place, for any reason. Alright, I suppose I will. Have you finished that? Yeah. You've got an answer there, but I haven't got a book to take in have I? You've just wasted, you finished that quite a long time ago, and you have Shall I do it now it's not worth it, there's two minutes left. I'll do it, I'll do it in the time. I'll do it in the time. Okay? No you won't you have just wasted ten minutes of that lesson, wandering round . Miss, I bet I've got all my homework right. We talking about the same Dicky? Yeah, that's her sitting over there. She came in . What, were you really friendly with her then? Yeah. She used to be one of my best friends. But you never used to hang round with her though did you? Well, sort of. I used to hang round with Nicky didn't I? Nicky? And Shelley? That was ages ago though, wasn't it? What in the first year, was this? No, erm, when we went to France, that sort of time. Oh, right. And then you broke up with her after that didn't you? Boring. So who's the love of your life these days? Why not? Why are you bothered then? Eh? I'm not. You are. I'm not now. You are. How come you wrote this then? If you're not bothered? Huh? I dunno. Nothing to tape. Oops, sorry. Eh, yeah, thanks. Oi, would you come to the computer service block with me? Yeah? I've gotta go in and get a folder. Folder? Eh? What folder? Do you have Mr ? Oh yeah, he punished me. I was writing something yeah? Yeah. And you know that little book I've got? Yeah. I was writing all the stuff, all this weirdo stuff, and he was standing over me looking at me, looking at what I was writing. And then, and Tracey, who was outside the window, she looked at me and she started laughing, and I go ha ha right. And I looked behind, and he was just sitting there staring like that. Oh my god. He gives me the creeps, so I looked round, hmm hmm. I mean, what is she doing? What does she want? Fuck off Thanks. Look, fuck off Janet, no one wants you. I know, I know. Have you got that piece of shit on? Have you got that piece of shit on? Yeah. Why? Can I just say something? Just wanna tell you I wanna fuck Howard . Oh, goodness sake I wanna shag, I wanna shag . Did you? From who? From Howard. Oh. Yeah, a poster. Can I have a bit of that Oh just, thanks, I just drank a drink. Alright, alright, alright? Look, so what is her problem now, gorgeous? I am the gorgeous, not her. Gorgeous, gorgeouses then. Why? I her. Why's that then? Why yeah but why? Because she loves her so much. Why Yeah but you won't even look at me? Okay, erm, what is Lucy's problem, do you know what's wrong with her now. She's under chains and whips. Oh right, cause I'm in chains and whips, help. Chains and whips I need a, I so desperately need a shag. But I lie 'cause I had Howard last night. She didn't. I was waiting there till about ten to nine. And then I was just so late, but I got, I came in Luke, so I was a bit early Really, oh my god. And now I'm on a late report. I've got to report every morning to Mr Cat. Why don't you just put the blame on her then? He goes oh er,cos I came in late So why didn't you tell them, like Lucy comes late and you have to wait for her and everything? 'Cause I said that before, and they go well why do you need to wait? And then say Mr said we've got to make her life comfortable because of the glandular fever. Then they can't say nothing. Oh yeah Joanna fancies Chris. bugger off. Chris? What a prat, he's an arsehole. Right look. It's just sh right, Eleni and Lucinda, go on you explain the story. He's about five foot tall. What? Explain the story of Mr . Okay. My mum said, she's going my mum said, she was going to sign in because she was late, and then I was giving her a pen like Mr asked me to come into his room. Hey. He goes Eleni come into Shut up. come in to my room a minute. And he goes, Lucy hasn't said anything, Lucy hasn't said anything, but I'd like to speak to you cause I've been molested by Howard. this thing is going nowhere. The end. Right and anyway, wants to see us about a quarter past two I wanna look at Howard's willy. That's if he could see us cos he's Bernard's really fit really fit and very cute but But really he should be in Germany He's an arsehole I fancy Howard, because he's really fit and beautiful and he's got gorgeous blue eyes Oh look at 'em talking about Howard what do you have to say to all this? I dunno, hold on, I think the record button's just come off. Chris B Who's Chris B? Is this thing recording? Yes, willy man. Crispie, Crispie. I fancy Lasagne Is Crispie erm, you know Daniel erm, whatever,. No I don't like him. I Don't fancy James really cute but he's an arsehole but she No comment. Oh thanks gorgeous. Just say something. Oi, I wanna suck Howard's willy. I wanna suck Howard's willy, cos it's really really thick. I wanna suck Howard's willy I wanna suck Howard's willy I love Lasagne There's four hundred and fifty pounds worth of corm blurgh. Well, I changed my mind. Oh no, I just looked at . I've looked at Howard's willy. Hi , how are you? Alright. Erm, good, say hello. What is it. Alright, how you going? What's that? It's a microphone, I'm taping what you're saying. You don't mind do you? Any news for me? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Bye. That's Dov. Dov is p that is Dov, Dovvy wovvy. Any way so erm Yeah he's a prick. Dov is pathetic. Hold on, hold on, has Lucy, do you think Dov's got a willy. Yeah, on his arm When was the last time Lucy rang you? Three minutes ago she stood there a fucking minute, never mind about Lucinda. brring brring, brring brring. Alright, alright then gorgeous. Are you supposed to swear on that thing? Yeah, you can say whatever you want. Fuck, shit, your mum, your dad, kiss my arse. Fucking Listen, you're shouting out quick help aah. No, can I just say something right, I'm not desperate and I'm not a slag or anything, it's just that I really really fancy Howard, and if I could I would suck his willy. I fancy Lasagne. Loving you there. Erm, well I'm sure she does. Erm, I'd just like to erm point out something. Come here Lydia . What do you want us to say? Er,squeezing against Olga's tits did you notice? Yes, I did notice. Well, I kind of rather felt sick and went away, because I thought er well. Yes. Oh alright then, if you hear any news from Miss will you tell me what happens at lunch. Yes, gorgeous. Oh I Know I'll tape it and play it back to you. Tape it, yeah. What, you gonna tape Oh my god . the conversation . Oh, I got a strawberry, oh I got a strawberry on my arm. I've got strawberry in my eye I've got a strawberry on my arse Yo, huh. Er yeah. Do you wanna see my strawberry? I've had it tattooed. I don't care. Right,gonna see your smash hits or what? Oh right. Oh, it's peeling off. Oh wow Oh my god , an Indian, oh let's all have a party Anyway alright gorgeous. Whoa, whoa, it's alive on me, bloody hell. Oh bloody hell Look I'm Betelguese by the way. Yes Olga. Oh I had mine here. Oi, are you going, oi, are you going on Saturday with Jessica then? No. Phew. I ain't going not Dean, we're just going out together I told her Who the fuck is Dean, could someone tell me. He used to go out with Lucinda. Oh yeah. But she dumped him because he's a gay. but he's good looking. Is he? What's wrong with being gay? Oh bloo , oh oh we have bad problems here. oh oh oh Oh god help him. Come one we've got to go At least she admits it everybody. Did everyone hear that? Come on can we get out of here. Right, okay everybody, erm, we're going, we're walking towards ,. Oi why were you ignoring erm, Adrian and the boy Steve? Dunno, I talked to him yesterday . Say hello in there. Alright, I rubbed it off, gorgeous. Have you been using that the whole day? I need my, oh no I need my erm, my bag. Shall we go and get our bags? No we don't need anything No, we've got to get we've got to get our bags. Right, now we're walking up to get our bags I don't care, we're allowed. We're allowed Miss. It's mine, It's mine. Alex's, it's Alex's, Alex's palex's. Sorry. I just like to tell you that erm, You love me and that I'm wonderful and that I'm great. Yeah? Where d'you get em from those things. I dunno. Okay, give me the mike. Hold on I've got it all caught. Pause it a minute. Really, you? Yeah, I know her as well. No, you kn you know Rosemary, my , Yeah, yeah. like she was best friends with her. She lives down the road, in . Oh, damn, I haven't got a bandage on me. Oi, Lucinda, I haven't got a bandage We are now approaching, erm, French. Now I know why I don't want to hang around with you because of you cow. hold on er now we are now hitting each other Oh, are you doing one of them as well? Yeah, gorgeous. Can I come over and speak to you? Hello, my name's Hold on one minute gorgeous. Ya, ya ya. Erm, Mr is a bastard. Oh, hey you took the words right That was dippy wippy. Bangers and Mash. Oh what? I got a joke yeah. There's three prostitu no not really. Erm, I got er, some rude jokes, but I don't think that's suitable. What joke can I tell them. Oi, get out of our classroom Right, I got a joke yeah? No I'm talking to the microphone Hello, why? Well, because Oh, that's good. Anyway,as I was saying before Adam interrupted me see I fancy Adam, he's really nice. Don't know about that. Yeah, you really want to see my homework, don't you James? Why do I sell homework? I do not know him I do not know him. Sir, why have I got three if I've got them all right? Yeah sir, I just missed out one word and you gave me two. What's all this? Erm, it's for a Norwegian, we've got to do. Teenage conversation. Yeah, well that was our stupid, sappy teacher. . Yes, well we're in French and it's really boring Yes, well, I think I'll turn you off for a minute hang on a minute, where's the button? Ah, here it is. I hate Mr . I hate him . Great ain't it. I'd just like to tell you, from now on, if you, look Mr Norwegian lady, I want to tell you something, this school sucks. There you go. I'd just like to tell you, that when you do something wrong, they never figure you out, and when you do something right, they make you do something wrong. It's a crap school. If you ever move over here, don't go to it, don't send your kids. Thank you. She's just talking a load of old bollocks. Excuse the swearing. But I don't know what the heck in this world it's very easy to meet peoples' I T requirements. It's certainly inhabited by some and it's certainly inhabited by some . Of course in fantasy land it's very easy to build computer systems. Once you've built your computer system it will run all the time certainly all the time . All the data will live in a nice tidy fashion in a single relational database but what happens. In fantasy land there are no politics so everyone can quite happily agree on how to things and agree on common . And we can impose solutions on our on our users, you know, You users can all have P Cs, you can all have erm dumb terminals. we can decide what you want to use. In fantasy land if we ever have to replace our systems we can of course simple switch off the old one and switch on the new one. . And er in fantasy land erm if you're responsible for I T you're of course very secure in your job you're a very happy employee because vendors will always come along and solve all your problems and ensure your personal security and success. Well we hope that erm by coming here you've demonstrated that you don't live in fantasy land so I'd like to welcome you to the real world and in the real world we know that open systems despite the progress they've made still struggle to replace the mainframe. And even where they have the technology capabilities to start doing this there is clearly little point in replacing an existing system with a new one which simply does the same thing. Even though open systems may be able to meet requirements at a lower cost than perhaps the traditional proprietary systems, if you've already paid for the traditional proprietary system, clearly there is no saving to be made by throwing it away and replacing it with the equivalent functionality on new technology. In the real world there is undoubtedly no such thing as an organization of any size or substance that can say, All my data lives in one source. We actually erm sometimes conduct a little informal surveys in our seminars and meetings as to how many information sources exist in organizations. And these sources will be things like spreadsheets,, relational databases our own and our competitors, and filing systems like R M S, er I M S er databases whatever. The answer is never one the minimum we've come across in an organization is two the typical is five to ten and in some organizations it's going on fifteen. And the number is not likely to reduce as the scope of spreads and as we're offered new technologies, software technologies by vendors. In the real world our users have different requirements and are not going to be slow to tell us what they are. In the real world systems and networks fail so there are times when our systems are not available. And that may be okay in a departmental level but when I had an integrated global enterprise operating in integrated fashion around an integrated I T system then clearly I cannot afford to allow a failure to actually paralyze the system. Of course I have to say that er software fails as well sometimes and indeed one of the problems we all have is that with today's hardware technologies some of the er computers are so fast that it really reaches the bugs rather quicker. Erm there still is no way of designing and managing distributed systems. I've actually taken something of an interest in this over the years and there's no substantive which tells you how to optimize and plan a distributed system in terms of what you do when. And the final point is that vendors will not be able to solve your problem. The decision you make today about which vendor you go with and which technology you go with may be the right decision today and yet may may be the wrong decision tomorrow. You only have to look back over what's er happened over the last few years in terms of for example O S Two, Microsoft Windows, a variety of Unix,and you'll see that technologies will come along and however sound a decision you make at one point in time the market circumstances and potentially mean that what was right for you then not the right . This is the world we have to live with and find a way . So we can view the requirements for enterprise client server really in terms of some paradoxes, and the paradoxes arise because of the conflict between what we actually want to achieve and the constraints of the real world. We would like to have well proven technology, because our systems need to be reliable. And yet we want to be able to exploit new opportunities and new technologies as they come along to get the best out of our systems for our businesses. We will want to be able to build high capacity systems so going to take on the class of applications that have traditionally been associated with a mainframe. And one interesting thing is that as we integrate that system as we double the number of users our requirements the loading on our system may go up by a factor of four. It's kind of an exponential relationship about systems bigger. In fact I've often said that if you show me a system which doesn't have a performance problem then you've shown me a system which is a failure. Because successful systems attract more use and more workload. So we need to build our systems to meet the requirements we have today because we couldn't justify more and yet we have to build in the scale scaleability so that systems can grow to meet the growing requirements which are almost inevitable. The systems need to be capable of integrating and inter-operating with these different technologies. So they need to provide transparent access across technologies and deal with the multi-vendor requirements. In fact er Dan who is the president of the corporation which is one of the sort of user pressure groups in the open systems world has said that, Integration is the highest cost component of nay I T system. For every dollar you spend on software, he alleges that you'll spend between one and a half and two dollars simply on getting that software to work the other software you have. In other words perhaps fifty percent of the spending on I T is wasted in inverted commas because it's simply concerned with tying together what you already have with the new stuff that you want to integrate in. The systems have got to deliver data reliably otherwise they're not of any value at all and yet they're going to have to deal with unpredictable events such as network failure, software failures, hardware failures, user failures or whatever. And we want to be able to provide the controllability that we achieve traditionally through centralization in the mainframe environment in what will inevitably be a distributed world. And our systems need to be consistent because in that way we can manage and control them and yet they need to deal with the variable requirements of our different categories of users. So we'd like our systems to be low risk, to be scalable, to be inter-operable, to be reliable, controllable and and yet still be able to face all the challenges of the of the enterprise client server environment. So that's really the challenges which way the client interacts and what today's er event is about. In the second half we'll be describing how our er new generation of products really seek to address each of those challenges. summary the system architecture which is the focus of today's seminar is really an er a complete environment within which we can deal with the challenges of this new generation of enterprise client server applications. And the underlying here is to provide the control and reliab we've achieved our er our aim in the first half of the seminar. Leading on to the second half I'd er very quickly like to introduce you to Huw er from er one of the U K's if in fact er worldwide now leading er leading developers of of financial software, and he will be er talking to th talking through to you his experiences er in developing with . Thank you. Thank you Garry. Er good morning ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to spend erm a few minutes, hopefully not too long because I'm er known for talking for hours and hours when it comes to our company and our product, but hopefully just a few minutes telling you about our approach to developing an open accounting system. If we go back about two years, a little bit more than two years now, we sat down and considered those areas which were most important to us in developing a new accounting package. First of all we wanted that product to be totally open, and I'll qualify in a minute or two a little bit more what I mean by totally open. I think at the moment suffice to say we wanted a product that would give ourselves and our users total choice and total flexibility. It was important to us in developing a new system now that we are very much of a worldwide supplier of accounting solutions, that we make it truly useable in all countries of the world. Now I struggled to come up with a good word or phrase to describe that, but the one we use for now is multicultural. And I'll go into that area in a little bit more detail in a few minutes. It should be a totally integrated solution, both from the point of view of the accounting application itself, and also the way that we inter-operate with the other applications in a user organization. We were conscious as well that in venturing into this brave new Unix world that accountants being fairly boring individuals, I mean how many accountants do I have in the audience today? I can say that reasonable safely and I can apologize to those people who put their hands up, by saying that I too am c am an accountant by background, and it's fairly brave of me to admit that in front of so many I T people. But we were conscious that an accounting system maintains the corporate financial information and we must protect the integrity of that information. So we must transcend those erm opportunities for security within Unix and ensure that our application will maintain the integrity of data within the system. And finally, and I can't emphasize this strongly enough, in developing our open accounting product we developed a totally new application. We started with a clean sheet of paper, we didn't start with one of our earlier proprietary products and try and convert that to Unix, try to move that into the open systems world. Our approach to accounting has always been one of a a truly integrated nature, and that approach fits like a hand in a glove with relational database technology. So the arrival and use of relational databases has been absolutely perfect for our approach to development of accounting systems. I mentioned a moment ago that we seek er total choice and total flexibility in the utopian open systems world. And the only true way that we can achieve that and that we can deliver that is by adhering to the emerging industry standards. Now on this slide we have a hexagon, there are six probably important facets in terms of standards which we should follow or adopt in the development of the product. If I start at the top with the user interface, then clearly we should use or employ a graphical user interface. In developing a product these days everybody's been very used to using P Cs, using graphical user interfaces, the idea of a mouse, drop- down menus, so on and so forth, and we should employ that technology. And the standard we chose ooh some two years ago was O S F Motif. Now that has clearly been the right choice given that I think Motif has clearly achieved the ascendant over open look. Moving round the picture, networking. Well we should use X-networking standards, and at the moment if a network complies to T C P I P as the communications protocol then we can work with that. And we'll actually look in a minute or two at the different aspects of the application, the different layers of the product, and how those communicate. On documents we must bear in mind with the development of any system that we should support true electronic data interchange. We should have a good and straightforward mechanism for importing documents into our system and exporting documents from our system. And the standard we've chosen to adopt there is Edifact. Now that's probably er one of the least well-defined areas for standards, and I mean if you say Edifact to er a North American user they'll look a bit puzzled, if you say it to somebody who knows something about Edifact they'll say, Which Edifact standard is that? But er those are gradually converging and we believe that's the correct choice. On operating systems we wanted to be as truly hardware independent as we can, so we have chosen to operate potentially under any Posix-compliant operating system, so that gives us all the flavours or brands of Unix and a number of proprietary mid-range operating systems which are achieving Posix compliance as time goes by. Even I B M have stated that O S Four Hundred on the A S Four Hundred will be Posix compliant erm oh certainly within the next twelve months if not somewhat earlier now. Far more relevantly to today's conversations and our host , is the question of databases. As I identified a minute or two ago, our approach to computerizing accounting applications fits hand in glove with the concept of relational database. We need a relational database to store our accounting data in, and whilst our overall approach is that we will work with potentially Ansi S Q L compliant relational database, I would like to emphasize that has been our primary development environment over the last two years. And as a brief but final point on there, what language did we develop our product in? Because we are er developers of a core accounting package which we hope will have many many hundreds of users before the end of this decade, we didn't want to rely on the vendor of a particular Four G L, so we've written our product in C to retain that independence within there. So we've identified a number of standards which we work within, standards for operating system, for database and for user interface. And those lead very clearly into another technology, client server architecture, which we've already touched on a number times during our presentation so far this morning. And I'd like to explain since we find ourselves in the real world, rather than fantasy land, how we've approached the subject of client server. If we start off by considering the accounting application as an object developed in C sitting there in the middle of the screen, we need the ability to talk to the users through a graphical user interface. We need the ability to address the relational database in which we hold our data. And delivered as an integral part of the application are two utilities to give us as much flexibility in achieving that goal as possible. In terms of the user interface, we have an X emulator and controller, XEC as we fondly know it by, erm in order to talk to the user through the users desktop device. Now we're conscious that there are a number of desktop devices available to us today and I'll go into these a little bit more in a moment, and that we want to support concurrent users of many different type of device. And in using Motif and using potentially X terminals as as the most elegant method of delivering that functionality, we can control X and we can emulate X on certain other types of device. Looking at the database our programmers in writing the central application and in developing and enhancing that application, are at one level totally independent at the functional level are totally independent of the underlying database technology. And our database controller understand and knows and talks to the database layer at the bottom. So if that database for example is there is no constraint within the way we use our system or the way we develop our system or indeed the way our system will develop in the future and the way capabilities will develop in the future. Because we're using our database controller to read and to write that database, as more function becomes available, more features become available within the server, the ideas of replication servers and so on an so forth as time goes by, we will be able to exploit that technology or more importantly you as users will be able to exploit that that that technology. I think the the concept I want to get across is that the design of the application does not constrain the way that you implement, firstly a client server technology and secondly the use of your chosen relational database management system. So by separating these individual items of the application, the presentation layer, the application layer and the database layer, we I suppose to say we don't care is the wrong word, we don't mind how much client server or how little client server you want your particular application to be. And indeed if if we broaden the picture out a little bit, and we've talked about the user interface and the relational database, clearly an accounting system can't stand alone. At the left hand side of my diagram we have a number of other applications existing in your environment which need to either provide information to the accounting system, a simple example might be a payroll application passing payroll costs across on a batch basis, it may be a sales order processing system passing invoice information across in real time interactively and indeed requesting information from the accounting application. So we have a powerful set er of open access tools to truly integrate the N application with the other systems running in your environment. And finally to to complete this particular picture, picking up again on a theme that was introduced earlier on, we are using proprietary relational database technology, so there are many other tools which are available to you, for example the ability of Lotus One Two Three to go directly into the database, pull information out, present it in a spreadsheet, present it graphically. Many other tools many other applications for example Forest and Trees, which are all capable of directly accessing the database. So the application is concerned with maintaining the accounting data and maintaining the integrity of that data but you have absolute flexibility in the tools that you use to access it and manipulate it and present it in your organization. And the way that you do that is going to depend on the sort of device which you have on your desk. Now again because of our approach we don't mind what kind of device you use. Arguably the most er elegant delivery of an O S F Motif type graphical user interface is through an X-windows terminal, but I wouldn't imagine very many of many of you have X-windows terminals. They tend to be fairly large and fairly expensive devices. We see an awful lot of people have got a tremendous investment in traditional character cell terminals and by a character cell terminal I mean a dumb terminal of twenty four lines of eighty characters. Erm I if I was talking to an audience in the United States, you'd probably have a somewhat different approach cos over there they seem to throw their desktop devices away every two or three years and replace them with brand new technology. In the U K we seem to keep the equipment for twenty years and then complain if it goes wrong before we have to throw it away. So on a character cell terminal, through our X emulator and controller, we can deliver a Motif style user interface, even on a character terminal. Clearly the degree of definition we can go to is only one character, but we have drop down menus we have the ability to move pop up windows and dialog boxes, the ability to scroll horizontally and vertically within those windows, and the ability to emulate the use of a mouse by the use of arrow keys and the numeric keypad on an ordinary character terminal. So we can deliver a consistent graphical user interface across a number of different devices in your organization, used concurrently with the accounting application. And in between the P C which we find on many peoples desks may be emulating a character terminal, may be emulating erm an X-terminal to provide that user interface to an individual. Now I think in our experience so far we find that erm the accounts clerks in the back office are those who are most likely to be bashing away at the character terminals, those are the people who are bashing data into the system. And they understand those devices and work with them very well, they're not particularly interested in a mouse and all sorts of graphical facilities because their job in life is to get information quickly into and quickly out of the system. Many people in a management position maybe using P Cs on their desk, I mean those move more and more into the organization as people work with spreadsheet people work with electronic mail and so on and so forth, and the ability to use the P C as their terminal, their window into the accounting application, but secondly they have these tools such as spreadsheets which again are able to directly access the database and the accounting data maintained within it. So in performing a particular query there are many ways of skinning a cat. Somebody may use standard enquiry facilities within the accounting system, they may use the report writing tools that are provided with the accounting system or they may use other things, Forest and Trees, Lotus, Excel, so on and so forth which run on their P C which they know and which they love. And it may be entirely appropriate to use any one of those for one style of enquiry depending on the preferences of the individual, that's what we mean by flexibility and freedom of choice, we don't want to constrain a particular individual to working in a certain way. I can't resist the temptation while I'm here just to tell you one or two things about the accounting application. Er because I don't have a group of accountants in front of me I'm not going to go on about debits and credits and so on and so forth. But just to consider one or two aspects which we mentioned earlier on as being important to us. In working in years gone by with proprietary applications we've been able to rely to a large extent on security facilities provided by the operating system. We can no longer realistically do that in the open systems world. So we need to ensure that we provide security at a number of levels, accounting type security which may be er the the limit to the amount I can write off in a cash in a cash matching process for example. Functional security, which is going to give me effectively er access restriction to the system by the menu options the drop down menu choices. Taking that level of security down to individual data items, what what areas of my chartered account can I update what areas can I look at? And that's important to us because we can give erm people who are responsible for a particular department full and immediate access to the data which relates only to their department and not the wider organization. But we do need to consider a couple of other areas. One which I've defined there with the word views. We are aware that we can control the method of access by users though our application, but there are other tools they are using in in the company to access the corporate relational database and your database controller must be aware of those tools and implement the same controls on those views of that information within the database. And very importantly to the accountant, the way that we can ensure that we maintain the integrity of the accounting data, is by exploiting checksum techniques in the database to ensure that the only valid way of u of updating the accounting data is through the accounting application and that's it's therefore properly secure and properly audit trailed. I mentioned culture briefly earlier on er I'd like to define that a little bit better by saying we want a user sitting down in any part of the world to be able to use the product which we develop and feel that it is an accounting application developed for their world and their market place. Not an American product which is being bent to their requirements, not an English product which is being bent to their requirements. And there are immediately two areas which are very obvious and straightforward, those of currency and language. We must for example be able to use concurrent users of the same accounting information in many different languages. But we need to take our consideration beyond that a little way in thinking about the accounting customs and legal requirements of the different countries. The taxation needs, it's not just V A T it varies in the European Community, it where it varies in a wider Europe and the world at a whole. So we need to be able to address those different requirements. And one which we o often overlooked was dealing properly with the different banking requirements of other parts of the world. I mean back in the early nineteen eighties when we sold our first er system abroad we were quite surprised to find out that the French didn't have a road called Edgeware Road and an organization called B A C S on it. We need to ensure that we can comply with the banking mechanisms of the different parts of the world. Another strength of using proprietary relational database technology is that we can use many report writers which are available to access that database, not only the accounting data but potentially all of the corporate data to pull out not only accounting reports but reports which combine information as necessary, partly from the accounting system, partly from the sales order processing system, partly from the inventory system, whatever they may be. And so within our accounting database we'll have various types of master file information, transactions, balances, some of that information may have been archived but still be available to us. With a single relational report writer we can gain ready and easy access to all of that information. A very brief commercial, just a little bit about . Erm I mean is a a British private limited company. Erm I'm actually based in our Harrogate office which is our corporate worldwide headquarters, we consider that to be the centre of the universe. But over the years as an organization we've grown organically and geographically quite significantly, such that while in the U K we're in Harrogate and Basingstoke, we have an ever increasing presence in North America, Europe, the Far East and Australasia. And our philosophy as a truly worldwide supplier of accounting software is that we should increase our presence in different parts of the world as our sales and marketing activity there merits it. We've seen a very controlled and steady growth over the thirteen years that we've been in business and I think as you can see there year on year we have consistently increased turnover and increased profitability. So to give you an idea of our size although we may be a little bit smaller than last year we turned over some eighteen million pounds and declared a profit before tax of just over three point one million pounds. One of my slides that didn't appear there, erm we're just going to mention one or two other points on erm our customer base. Now the open systems world is a very new world to us, we have three earlier proprietary products, the first of which we started selling in nineteen eighty. And we actually have more than eight hundred and fifty users of our accounting software installed in more than forty countries worldwide. And to tie in to a couple of things mentioned earlier on. I noticed that amongst our user list we count, an organization called and we also count an organization called . So clearly many of the things do are very right and very appropriate and probably one of the rightest was to choose accounting software on which to er prepare their corporate accounts. Thank you very much for listening to me patiently, I said I would try to keep that down to erm a fairly brief session. What I would like to do now is to reintroduce Phill who addressed us a little bit earlier this morning who's going to tell us a little bit more about enterprise client server solutions. Phill, over to you. Thank you. We've heard a lot this morning er about the merits of client server and where it's come from in the last five years. Before the break John talked about erm some of the requirements for moving that architecture towards erm the enterprise-wide solution. So what I'd like to do right now is explain how System Ten will be the way to deliver enterprise client server solutions. And I'll do this by describing each of the System Ten products that resolve the paradoxes of the I T department. We mentioned earlier the paradoxes which were that for instance erm we're looking for a low risk investment or our customers are looking for a low risk investment, they tell us they need well proven technology but that needs to be advanced technology. SQL Server is flagship product. It's the foundation for client server and other products in the family. It's well proven having been shipped since nineteen eighty seven but provides new advanced technology with the new System Ten release. We talk about for instance reliable data delivery and transaction delivery. We need to be able to do business whether or not the network is unavailable or whether or not the system fails, we still need to make business decisions. Based on best available information. Replication server is a way to guarantee data delivery where it's needed and when it's needed. And we'll come on to talk about that in a lot more depth during the presentation. We talk about scaleability if we are indeed to entice mainframe style applications towards the open systems platforms then we need to behilosophy as a truly worldwide supplier of accounting software is th software components with a low entry cost. Navigation server is designed to handle massive amounts of data and users, but is still totally scalable from very small machines. We talked about each department erm being able to invest in their own technology and make their own er decisions on what sort of database or interface they would use to deploy their applications. But if we grow a client server towards the enterprise solution, we've already talked about the straw pole that we often do where it indicates to us that the average number of er data repositories or data sources in an organization is more than ten. So our customers are looking for multi-vendor transparency. Omni SQL Gateway provides transparent access to homogeneous and heterogeneous data sources. We also talked about the need to be able to control this vastly more complex new environment as if we were controlling a mainframe. with System Ten has announced a family of control servers which will enable us to control this network of servers and clients as if it was a single machine. And finally in terms of prod productivity each of our users have varied requirements, but we need to provide them with a consistent solution. Enterprise client sar server tools erm is a very important part of strategy. With acquisition of Gain multimedia tools and the unveiling of a leading edge tool strategy in June of this year, should now be considered as a major player in the tools arena. Providing tools that empower the user with all of the data which is available through the System Ten architecture in a form which is appropriate to all of the users. During the rest of the presentation what I will endeavour to do is describe each of the components of the System Ten architecture which is represented by this slide. Before I do that I'd like to describe SQL Server Ten which is the cornerstone of client server solution. SQL Server as we said is well proven technology, it's been around about five years. Five thousand customers have written many thousands of mission critical business applications using the SQL Server. It's designed from day one to address client server. It incorporates technology which our competitors are only now putting in their solutions. Still procedures, triggers, and R P Cs. The new release of SQL Server SQL Server Ten is a hundred percent Ansi compliant. So we have such facilities as cursors, and Ansi declarative referential integrity. And that's not to say that they replace triggers, because they are actually have a very important role to play in terms of being able to er maintain arbitrary business rules and model the way your organization works, inside the database repository. I'm going to be talking a bit more later in the presentation about back up and back up performance which is one of the key areas which erm organizations trying to support very large databases have come across as a as a as a major stumbling block or hurdle to get across. And have er implemented something called the backup server to get over that hurdle in the System Ten release. Also the SQL Server Ten incorporates C two level security we also have a B one compliant database for government applications. So we're have in such things as password encryption and auditing. And these are sorts of facilities which we'll will need if we're going to erm enable central I S or I T departments to use and therefore charge back that facility to each of the departments using that resource. But SQL Server alone will not address all the needs of enterprise- wide client server. It needs to evolve in several ways to meet these needs. As I go through the rest of the presentation you'll see erm the agenda slides highlighting the area of the architecture we're talking about in the section. So right now I'm going into a section talking about distributed servers. During the nineteen seventies a lot of research work was done on distributed database technology by such people as I B M, Digital, and other database pioneers such as. Their intention was focused on some of the huge benefits that distributed database might deliver. And these expected benefits were things such as performance, data could reside closer to its point of most frequent use. And multiple databases could act in parallel. It included such things as reliability. With centralized systems, if the computer goes down, the entire system goes down, but we still need to make business decisions. With distributed database systems we could continue with a couple of things mentioned earlier on. I noticed that amongst our us includes capacity and scaleability since a database could span multiple machines, the capacity of any one machine would no longer limit the database size. These needs lead to a number of different database technologies which are represented on this slide, and the first one I'd like to focus on is replication. Replication meets the need for reliability in a distributed environment. Whereas businesses are moving to more and more decentralized operations, business units still need to have instantaneous access to information. Access to data wherever they are no matter what location. Distributed transactions guarantee that data at each node is synchronized as it changes. A global model of the business delivered to who needs it when they need it where they need it. But as I've already mentioned distributed database theory has been around a long time. The model suggested has not met with widespread acceptance. It doesn't necessarily address all of the needs of the real world. At we believe there are two types of distributed database application. There are those where mission critical business decisions can only be made based on absolute up to date information. These applications require absolute synchronization of related data at every site in the distributed database. And for this we would use Two Face Commit technology. Two Face Commit for those who're not pu er familiar with it is an all or nothing approach. If any one node in the distributed database is unavailable, the transaction will not complete on any other. If we took an example of a of a launching of the space shuttle. In those types of applications those types of systems, we cannot afford inavailability of information we need to invest significant sums of money if fault tolerant hardware in mirrored disks in duplex networks. This investment can only be justified for systems where transactions have a huge value to that business. Two Face Commit is the software technology that supports these types of systems. has had Two Face Commit technology for five years in support of that style of application. However we believe there's a second type of distributed database application more appropriate for general commercial use. Very few organizations the first model due to its prohibitive cost. Replication Server takes a revolutionary approach to distributed database for those organizations who don't need absolute data synchronization but the nee need the advantages of up to date data at ll of its points of most frequent use. The need reliable data delivery in the event of system failures without the prohibitive cost of fault tolerant hardware. Replication server is based on our primary subscriber model. Each subscriber on the network, we might represent the primary as the server on the left and the other two server as subscribers. Each subscriber registers its interest in a data item on the primary replication server. The primary replicates data changes or transactions to subscribers as updates or inserts occur on that primary server. So this model uses a loose synchronization. There's a latency between the primary changing and the secondary data changing since the primary will change and then we replicate across the network to each secondary location. But that's measured in fractions of seconds. And this is e such facilities as I'd now like to talk about high capacity and solution for that requirement in enterprise-wide client server. Often in the open systems arena applications will grow beyond the capacity of any single machine. Traditionally when systems have grown this large companies have employed proprietary solutions, hardware software combinations. And these systems lose the advantages of open architecture for instance we talked about having over two hundred front end tools accessing database. And are typically good at either online transaction processing or decision support but not a combination of both. And without this capacity how can we expect large scale mainframe users to down-size or right-size into open systems. response to these requirements is rep is navigation server. Navigation server is a software extension to the S Q L Server. It optimises it for distributed massively parallel processing. It creates the appearance of a single virtual machine on a network. However in fact behind a navigator or a navigation server there will be any number of SQL Servers working on parallelized S Q L. Now this solution provides us with total linear scaleability, as we run out of processing power we will add another node to the environment and take advantage of all of the processing power of that node using parallel S Q L. This is a hundred percent software solution it's not a hardware software combination. Developed on S V R four with N C R. And it's a key point that this is a combination of work which have done with N C R and the first release of Navigation Server will be available on the N C R thirty six hundred architecture. Which enables us to have many hundred erm Intel processors in a single hardware cabinet. So we would run many SQL Servers with a Navigation at the front. But other platforms will come in the future so we can see us using sta very low cost standard hardware components, we might stack up erm half a dozen or a dozen erm workstations with a high speed interconnect between them each running a SQL Server. We've now created this virtual machine which is no longer constrained by the absolute size of any one component within that machine. And we can add workstations to that virtual machine as we need more processing power. So we have high capacity with low entry cost using standard components. So we're now able to support mainframe class applications with thousands of users in this data centred type database running thousands of applications with a mixture of decision support and online transaction processing. As we've already suggested this is a cost effective solution it is a software only solution and enables us to use lots of erm low cost hardware components. I we come back again to those distributed database issues and tackle transparency. As I as we've said this is a requirement which is consistent with enterprise-wide client server. As we expand the client server architecture to become a universal solution we will need to integrate more diverse sources of information. We will need to leverage our customers existing investments in other technology. We will need to provide an evolutionary approach to migrating from one technology to another so we're not forcing our customers down the fantasy land alternative. John's already stolen my thunder on the straw poll erm that I was going to do but suffice to say that we normally do that at these types of seminars and there's always a few people in the room who put their hands up and say they've got more than ten data sources in their organization. And if truth be known there are many more in that audience. In the real world we have to recognize that we cannot convert customers to only use the database. We must be able to provide a level of transparency that shields users and the programmers from not only where the data is stored but in which relational database management system. solution is Omni SQL Gateway no other product delivers the level of transparency that Omni provides. Omni SQL Gateway provides complete location and vendor transparency. All the clients on the network are programmed using a single dialect of S Q L so our programmers no longer have to know the nuances and differences between each of the proprietary extensions of the SQL of each database they're programming against. They s use a single a dialect which is Transact S Q L S Q L implementation. All of the sources on the on the network look like so for instance I can do joins across two heterogeneous R D B M Ss. you can have a table with departments in , employee's in Oracle, and salaries in D B two and I could use a single select statement and join all that information together in a single request to the Omni SQL Gateway. But what I can also do is leverage the power of client server extensions to S Q L. We talked about pioneering efforts in stored procedures and triggers. I can actually use Omni SQL Gateway and write stored procedures stored procedures against all of the data sources it supports including for instance D B two. So I'm not limited because I'm by the lowest common denominator of other gateway approaches. And because the Omni SQL Gateway looks identical to a SQL Server on the network we still have the ability to integrate and front end tool. So I still have over two hundred front end tools which can access data from the Omni SQL Gateway which actually has physical data stored in many different types of vendor's repositories. A wonderful example for today since we're in Leeds is er United Leeds it also e such facilities as typically they're very used to the mainframe environment and what the mainframe environment offers. The mainframe is a single machine sitting in a darkened room. It's easy to control. It's a single physical piece of hardware. It's technology which is mature, it's been around about thirty years, and there's lots of good sophisticated control tools for managing that environment. As we move to the brave new world of client server we're talking about a technology which is indeed fairly immature, is more difficult to control, and is essentially quite complex. As we move towards wide area networks of servers then we have something which is a very sophisticated system for delivering information. One of partners is Stores who are implementing a strategic store-based application which involves having an R S six thousand in every single shop with a SQL Server on every single box. With three hundred and sixty SQL Servers, there's no way they're going to have a D B A in every store. What they need is centralized control as if they had a single mainframe. So aim with our control servers is to deliver mainframe controllability in an open distributed environment. One of the components of the control server family is the backup server which is part of the SQL Server Ten release. Traditionally open system database backups have been constrained by the speed of any one backup device. The backup server that is providing at release ten has or employs device striping to provide linear scaleability of the backup to multiple da tape and disk devices. So I could have for instance thirty two tape devices running in parallel to back up my database. So for instance if my backup window is an hour and that's how long it take me to backup my database today, if had the backup server and I was using one device it took an hour, if I used two it would learn one dialect of S Q L. as incorporating in partnership with Tivoli such standards as D M E and D C E which Tivoli indeed helped to define. So this incorporates controllability of the network, the hardware as well as the database architecture. Earlier we described a paradox which was that each user or group of users has a different need for information and the way that is presented to him. Furthermore this is compounded by the wealth of different types of desktop devices for presentation of information. What I'd like now like to do is to describe some of the components of tools strategy to enable and empower us to deliver enterprise-wide client server solutions. However no matter what the user or device requirement there is a requirement for one thing and that remains critical and constant. And that requirement is productivity. Back in the nineteen seventies computer hardware was very expensive and difficult to use. Only highly trained professionals dared to interact with a computer. In the nineteen nineties with the tumbling costs of hardware we can adv afford to provide more and more people in our enterprise-with access to a computer or the information within in. And this simply shifts the cost of providing that solution to an investment in the people and not the computer hardware. So we need to train them to use our systems and we need to be concentrating on the productivity not just of the programmer which is traditional what we've done with Four G Ls but the productivity of the end user. The user community will run into thousands and thousands and therefore this is our biggest investment in our I T infrastructure. Today in many large organizations we'll see three generations of desktop delivery mechanism, the old dumb terminal, the thirty se tw thirty two seventy dumb terminal for instance. Delivering character based data to the desktop. People have then migrated towards using G U I typically at departmental level. They'll have standardized on one particular G U I delivery mechanism. Which is traditionally you know Windows Three, Open Look or Motif, maybe O S Two. And then into the future where will that G U I capability lead us? Well we've already talked briefly and we've seen a video about Gain Multimedia and how that might enable us to address application requirements in a different way. With applications that actually look like the way you do business. And traditionally these three types of delivery mechanism mean we have to rewrite or recode applications in their entirety for each type of device. That's further compounding the maintenance burden on the I T department or the information systems provider. has three components to its client architecture to address the needs of the different users and the different devices. Each component has been announced as part of the System Ten announcement and in fact A P T and Gain Multimedia are available in production today. In June will be announcing a complete architecture which welds these technologies together, providing an object based integrated environment for all user requirements and device types. So indeed we do not need to rewrite applications for each different type of device or user. Well what we'd like to do now is just try and address each of those different Four G Ls in the architecture. First is A P T which is essentially a heads down data entry facility. So that me we may have for instance erm order entry clerks entering many many orders per day. They actually don't spend too much time looking at the screen, they're actually using dumb terminals to enter data very quickly. And therefore we have a low cost er per seat of entering that information into the system. That's a procedural thing, we do one thing, we do another then we do the other, then we come back and do it again. And that type of application is very well erm very well used by dumb terminal applications. Enterprise G U I will enable us to take advantage of erm G U I desktop devices such as Windows Three. This is a type of environment used by decision makers where they may be working on one piece of information in the application and they need to make a decision based on an information which is elsewhere in the application. So they'll move from one window to another make a decision on that information in the other window and come back to what they were doing before. This is a non procedural approach to making decisions based on the information inside the system which has been entered by the dumb terminal users the heads down data entry. And for this we would use object based technology, object oriented technology to enable us to have this business processes modelled inside the desktop. And for the future of applications we talked about Gain and Multimedia and what that might deliver in applications that look like your business. Where we can deliver applications where the users actually don't need training. This is a self training interface. Enterprise G U I is a tool which is presently in development er which is subject to an announcement in the June timeframe and in fact actually at the next customer update which is providing erm in June. It's a repository based G U I development environment which is using object based technology. It enables us to develop application on for instance Windows Three and exploit all of the functionality and features of Windows and deploy on Open Look, Motif and Macintosh. It will enable us to develop applications on Macintosh, taking advantage of all the features of Macintosh and deploy on Windows, Motif and Open Look. And that is a G U I environment which is robust and native. We don't emulate Windows Three in Open Look, we don't emulate the Macintosh on Windows Three. We use all of the native widget sets so we're not using the lowest common denominator approach. But one thing which makes this product stand out from the crowd is its ability to to address the needs of work group computing. Based on its object based repository. So I can develop application code and share that across my work group or the department of developers. So this is where we believe the market place is today with application development in the G U I desktop. We've already seen a brief glimpse of of of of Gain Multimedia. This is the type of technology which may indeed eventually replace the traditionally data entry heads down data entry facility and user. We have a an order entry clerk who's now ordering hundreds of orders a day and that is from a printout from our customers and that printout has come form the computer system of our customers. And they have a data entry clerk who's entered that order onto their system and then printed it out. So we have several levels of interaction with a computer in terms of entering information. Multimedia will enable us to place a console or our system or an extension of our information infrastructure in our customer's environment and enable them to interact with our systems though an interactive self teaching sentry rich environment. So we can get rid of all of those different costly interactions with a computer with er interactions of com of of paper output erm dumb terminal input paper output dumb terminal input. So all this can be do done and integrated through Multimedia. One er one of Gain's first customers in the U S was er E D S. E D S have er will be using Gain technology to deliver erm what they're calling console applications for the World Cup in nineteen ninety four in U S A. So that in the in the er the World Cup environment there will be kiosks around thes the er the the training camps for instance where players or er fans can go up and touch using a touch screen can see the er the the highlights of the last Cameroon versus England game, they can find out where the nearest Indonesian restaurant and they can find out the team news for the next game. And all of this using Gain's multimedia capabilities. So we're extending the way that information systems can be used by users who traditionally have not been en empowered or enabled to get at that information. One of the other key partners of Gain Multimedia is Sun. If you buy a certain level support from Sun Microsystems, they will ship you an application which is built using Gain Multimedia. And that application is a self teaching way to use a S Sun Unix workstation. Traditionally if you buy a w unix workstation and you turn it on out of the box, look at the screen and you'll see a percent sign. What do you do next? You turn to the manual and try and work out how it's going to how you're going to interact with it. Well Gain Multimedia will enable you to turn on the workstation and it will talk to you, it will show you videos, it will show you animation as to how that workstation should be used to best advantage. So System Ten is the culmination of several years of work that we've been doing with other hardware and software vendors but most importantly with our customers. We've worked together to make sure our products address the needs of the real world. approach is one which is essentially pragmatic. I've talked during my presentation about each of the paradoxes which we laid out at the beginning of the morning which talked about the diverse needs of different parts of an enterprise from their information systems if we are to deliver the adv er the advantages of enterprise-wide client server. I hope that we have proved today that SQL Server is well proven advanced technology, Replication Server enables us to deliver data to who needs it, where they need it, when they need it even if there are system failures, that Navigation Server provides us with a high capacity with a low entry cost, that Omni SQL Gateway enables us to have complete vendor transparency and integrate all information for decision support. I hope that we've been able to convey the way that Control Servers will enable you to control the client server environment as if you're controlling a mainframe, and I sincerely hope that we've been able to talk erm knowledgeably knowledgeably about our tool strategy and how we can address the needs of each different group of users with different desktop devices in a consistent manner. is committed to deliver solutions for real world problems. has set the client server agenda for other vendors for four years, and with System Ten we hope to continue to do so. Before we finish, what I'd like to do is erm show you a video, another testimonial from er one of strategic partners which is the courier company. Er once we've showed you that video, Garry's gonna come back and just sum up very briefly and then we'll open the floor for questions and answers. Thank you. time. Er one thing that does intrigue me following Phill's presentation is how the average British football fan will cope with a a Gain Multimedia workstation in Atlanta in the World Cup. Er could be quite interesting. Erm I get the easy bit after Phill's difficult presentation, er talking around nice slides like this and yes that's the yellow brick road around what we've talked about this morning. Er a quick summary because we have overrun. Er just as we owned that famous street in New York I'd like to think with the technology and the architecture that can deliver today we we'll own the road to enterprise client server. Er and you can all read what we've talked about there. That's where we've come from, we've talked about what's what's a available today, and we've talked about where we'd like to take our users in the future. Er and I can think of erm nothing better than to leave you with this slide er which I think sums up where we're coming from today and what we'd like you to take away from today. Er I'd like to i ask our presenters this morning to join me on the stage to take any questions from the floor and ask if you could er fill in your er y y your sur your sheets on the on today's events before you leave a, a bank, from a building society or somebody like that and we have to charge a rent er to the property that will repay that loan and, the way in which we actually do it is, is we charge a lower rent and actually who pays the rent quite substantially below that er, because erm the rent on these properties if we i if we charge what the the housing corporation's grant as it's set would be round about ten, twelve pounds more expensive than that. Er, it's not a funding system that er that we would choose to to work under, we would want to keep the rents as low as possible er, but it's one that's set by central government through the housing corporation and that we have to live with. What we do do for our residents is employ a welfare benefit service so that they can maximise the er the housing benefit section that that they're eligible for to to make the po properties as affordable as as they can be. And obviously, we're, we're concerned that people erm will rent our properties who will then be reliant entirely on housing benefit er and and and if they increase their income they may be worse off! Er the fact of the matter is, it's the system that we as housing associations gonna have to live with er if if we're going to build new homes. Thank you. Alright secretary? Anyone else? Right! And can I then er draw attention to the recommendation on one o threes on er one er, sorry, on er B the amended notes that er came from er, the area committee er and er C. Are you all in favour of those? Oui! Oui! Mm. Do you want to show a a raising of hands so that we can assure your agreement. Okay. Anybody against? No. Right. Thank you very much. Then sit down now. Right erm we'll come on to item three er, with the questions from the public and er Becky is going to talk to about er questions. Thank you Chairman. Erm on the supplementary paper sent round you will see at I think it's page one and two, a letter received from the Carters Mead Resident's Association erm I hope you've all had a chance to read that as it was circulated to members in advance. Erm this matter was raised at committee and I'd like to explain the item of committee that prompted the letter from Carters Mead Resident's Association. Can I just say a few brief things to this, firstly, I share their concern entirely and totally and I don't think there's an officer round this table who wouldn't agree with that, and I also believe, having met with all the board members this morning, I know that the board members similarly agree. Erm we have taken various steps immediately, one is that the vandalism that taking place over the erm we have immediately re-secured, I have to say there's been about fifty erm tickets out to re-secure those those, that site over the summer but they have been re-secured and tomorrow morning there will be the commencement of bricking up of the doors and windows of the ground floor of block D,block. Can I also say that the erm the fear expressed about Woolwich, I believe to be fairly well founded Woolwich building, a Woolwich er, Building Society had been on erm, entered into a long time ago on this erm and the letter that was read out at Potter Street area committee from Woolwich indicated that they hadn't yet decided whether they would proceed and er I think is I've talked to the publican since they have promised us an answer this week er we are intending, we have spoken, Dermot's also spoken to our managing director we are confident we will have an answer from this week and I have to tell you that I think the answer will either no, or it will be so hazy that we'll need to take some action and make a decision. I sa , as I say, I met this morning with the three members from Potter Street erm we do have various alternative proposals for sa ways forward should the village back out and what I can say to you at this stage is that we have another meeting scheduled for next week, we will be meeting with the Resident's Associations keeping them fully informed erm we will ensure that the letter goes back to Mrs who and the other Resident's Associations who expressed concern there and that we will be taking, I hope, I hope because I'm gonna have to say if Woolwich back out we're going out we're going have to move very fast and do some quite erm in-depth work. We hope we will be able to take new proposals to Potter Street on the second of November if nothing else, we will certainly take them an honest indication of where we've got to so far and what proposals will be taking place, and what we will be proposing erm for the future. But, I mean the concern Carters Mead Resident's Association I think is well founded, I think there's been a lot of problems and er I think it can come upon us all to keep talking with them and to improve the situation should the should Woolwich back out. Thank you Melanie. Er, I noticed Mrs is in the audience, is there anything you'd like to say referring to what the officer Erm has said? just to to verify the fact that we are making so many , you said about pulling out as well is there a possibility of that? Erm Well hm you can see that er, members are also very concerned about it and er we've er,i there are external circumstances that you know, we have to look into first. But erm Mrs , said she will keep you informed of will discuss with the er, residents and the board of councillors. . If I could just say one other thing, that is that I've had a an initial of, of the blocks done and pending the outcome of Woolwich which I expect to get tomorrow erm, if they are backing out then I will be getting a full structural, engineers structural survey within a couple of days, this is the actually meeting plan. Mm. Yes. Er er anybody got any questions to put to Melanie, er about er yes, er yes er Norma? Yeah, I'm rather concerned that this kind of thing seems to be happening rather a lot, I mean this is so reminiscent of what happened in the, the four maisonette in in Fern Hill where we had empty blocks left for a long time erm becoming a magnet for vandalism and all kinds of everything! We've also seen it happening, to an extent in properties in Bishopsfield as well erm I really think we need to get to grips with what we seem to be doing, which de-counting people prematurely early er, in response to, to housing developments which we are planning to undertake in in partnership with other people and leaving ourselves open to this and not Well what could we be doing you tell yourself,. not only can pose as a danger but it presents er the unsightliness erm an and all the other problems associated with that. It seems to be happening far too often, and I wonder i I wonder what's actually going wrong that this happening so often and in so many places, seems to be something that you know, perhaps we need to address it far more generally as a problem of housing management as a whole. Er well if I can er answer some of those er, points. Er, first of all, I ensure that people are not de-counted unless they have er, wished to go and maybe that their their dwellings are er, in er a state of er, disrepair or there's something structurally wrong that they feel unsafe er, in them and then er, they are, I don't like the word de-counted, but then they er, are offered er other accommodation. I would agree with you that if the if we have gone along and said to people, well er yo , we've got alternative accommodation for you and they haven't wanted to go then, well I'm sure that we hope not to give them that er er, alternative accommodation er, and it's not in our interest at all to er, keep er, places empty, and further more we haven't really got er enough er, alternative places to put er, these er tenants in so I'm that it's as the result of the sort of dwellings that er we've er we now find ourselves with as a result of the er initial buildings in the first place. But we won't go into that, that's history! But it would be very interesting if er you had a positive er proposal or something constructive to make which we might be able to examine, but I can tell you at the end of the day money is required and this government won't allow to spend er, the money that er we have got er er erm at the moment that we could, er use but they won't let us. And further more, they don't come up er, with the er right amount of money for our needs er, but er it is er, duty bound er to us. I'm not disputing that, I'm simply saying that perhaps we have a management problem here where we could be doing things differently and I'd like to hear some positive suggestions from housing officers as to how you can address that. Oh! Well now er, if you've got some critical comments about the management of it perhaps you could write and we have a look at them. Alright? Any other members want any comments on Carters Mead indeed other ? No. No. Right. Thank you. Well thank you for your comments anyway erm we'll get er back to our next er item er, on the agenda. We've got a couple of erm er, oh that was the only one from the er questions is it? Yes, that's the one from there But it's right. Er, unfortunately Perhaps Bill could contentious items I've suggested five D and eleven eleven Got it here. ele eleven D yes. five hundred copies. five. Oh yes, that's right we right yes, five and er eleven D. Er, eleven is B. the same. B B. , yes. That's right. Sorry about that! Er, then erm er, we come to er, museums er,spoken . Right, thank you very much June. If I could draw members attention to the supplementary papers erm and it's page three which is the second report and it will become I will make it clear with regards to the er linking up of the two reports, both museums and Essex committee linked up to the museum registration. Erm members will re ma , will be reminded the report was requested at the last personal services committee with regards to the council's involvement in the current museums and Essex committee er, I'm also requesting er, the financial contribution that this council actually makes to that committee. Erm the report identifies the history of the committee and outlines the benefits that Harlow has achieved through membership. I'd like to highlight the er a quote by the county museum's officer with which the predominately the amount of er contribution which was agreed by this council on the twenty third of March ninety ninety er which actually relates to the size of the population, I will actually point that the thousand pounds has actually increased to one thousand three hundred, this year, because of, population has actually increased since then. We've already valued the use of free displays or whatever erm if I could point out the recommendations that the members agree in the report, the members agreed Harlow Council's continued membership of the museums and Essex committee. Right. Are there are any members any comments to make on these? Agreed. Are they Agreed for it? Does anybody oppose the recommendation. No. Thank you. The, the actual link is linked to museum registration which I'm sure members will remember erm with regards to the long running saga of the additional storage facilities. And going through on page sixty five in the main agenda this outlines the current plan to achieve registration for Harlow's museums in order to achieve to achieve the a the a a and tangibility to grasp to to obtain aid from the museum's national bodies. Agreed. Agreed. Right. Thank you very much . Erm seven, neighbourhood er welfare candidate. Rejected. Yes, at the last meeting these committee members did ask that er he produce some details of help and and a number of cases dealt with have been apparent and the details are presented for, for amendment.. Thank you. Who was it who wanted to know something on that? Yes I It's it's me. Yeah, I would like to do is just mention that it's so surprising really that er the resources used are out of all proportion to what we used to er do on it, on the other central panel. We've had ten meetings and only thirty cases, and that'll be the three cases where each meeting spread over a five different locations, which er doesn't seem a very good way to use our resources! So what I was wondering was er the scheme is in it's infancy this and I'm all in the favour of the decentralising in principle, but I think we ought to perhaps look at it a bit closer, and I would suggest that we have an up-to-date report at the next meeting of this committee so we can compare it over a longer term so, as that we might then reflect on a if we're doing the right thing or not. But it seems a waste of the resources to er have er, ten different meetings for thirty cases we that's, that's my view but, I would like to see another report at the next meeting so as we can compare. Right er Frank have you got any comments er to make on that? Yes, I I Councillor is quite right, I mean it is a new new departure to centre these panels in the neighbourhoods, it was always our intention to come back after a a period had elapsed er,we , with the new system to bring to members attention the success or otherwise of the neighbourhood panels. Erm and certainly I think I think in going to neighbourhood panels it was it was to serve a democratic process of tenants being able to panels local to their that area and I think in that sense erm it has been successful and certainly, I think as far as we were concerned er, it avoids the perhaps intimidating nature of, of tenants appearing in a large centre of the various panel which er I think was er, certainly one of the members wishes when we started on a neighbourhood basis but, yes it was our intention and, I would think that it's quite reasonable to ask us to bring the report to the next meeting er with a better explanation of how the council works so far. Yeah. May I ask er, another question is of the thirty cases in the neighbourhood the tenants don't need . No, I haven't that information,tha that that detail was asked for, but I do know that er that certainly in a majority of cases because they are local erm the attendance from tenants was certainly substantial and I would of, but certainly far more than you would expected if the panel perhaps had been inside a . . Er, just a minute, I'll ask Ann and then Lesley. Ann? I wa I wanted a a point that er respond er neighbourhood and the manager I spoke to said that the areas that were the case since er,de decentralisation because er people are er er in coming to neighbourhood offices and that of the of the managers arrange er er er aims or er either run in in two neighbourhoods er er I I feel personally it's been very worthwhile because we were able to talk to the er, they they they were never able to go and and and they came to the er, the neighbourhood offices international conducive er er er or er er ah i i in areas they want to talk to , so I I, I personally would would like to see this continuing er for perhaps a it isn't the best value for money i i i it certainly far better for for for can come to their neighbour office Speak to Thank you. . Thank you Ann. Les? Thank you,. Er, as you know, I haven't been exactly an enthusiastic supporter of neighbourhood erm areas, but I have to confess Some never attended them! I have to confess that on that, in so far as those that I've attended, and I've had a couple in my area I have to confess my surprise at the efficiency of them! And I really see that the public now certainly they give certainly for the benefit of the a ten , the tenants that A are presented Yes. there in comparison with the archaic way of old Bill's seventeen round this table Oh that's quizzing people don't go back to that way, that old system! The people there are that's going to the neighbourhood are getting a fair crack of the whip and they're being the centre of that every week. Er er, I wish the man wo wouldn't put words into my For what it's worth mouth Chairperson! No. I understand. I say I think that's quite No. wrong! I I Interpretation was You're not archaic and the and the er the me er the meeting to be called not And we archaic cos we have the Don't take it personal Bill! It wasn't meant Well er, he meant it, you meant it personal! Yes , alright, yes. Do breakdown Could we do it Come along! of Councillor conversion, decentralisation Yes! Yes! Yes! And I think that'll be gone on very late, yes. Jim? Yes Chairer, why don't we pat ourselves on our, on the back about this it would it be useful i in in the the report, a further report that's gonna come forward if there could be some indication as to actual format that was adopted when a person goes to one of his welfare panels, cos I've been to three and there doesn't seem to be any consistency whatsoever in the way that things occur or whatever! I don't think Right. it's entirely fair! Yes, I think that's up to the Chairer so Oh, I think it's up to the council Chairer to say what, what procedure should be so, in fairness,. Yes, yes. There is one other point, although erm you know, it's good that they are in the er areas which the tenants er, live so it's er not very difficult for tenants to come and see their councillors but er er, there is a difficulty at times when er the er air the housing manager has to ring around to get the er members, who are able to sit on that panel and sometimes that is difficult because we have just three members and sometimes they can't all fit in the , whereas when you have a larger group if one member can't attend, there's invariably sufficient there to be able to come to a decision so I think that that's on the other side of the balance sheet. But, altogether yo , er sorry, you wanted to say something on that? Yes, I do sorry! I, I don't often agree with Jim about anything , but I really do agree with him about this, that there has to be some clear guidelines, I think, as to how these are fixed, they are not going be have the potential of being very unfair to people because people operate in different ways in different areas and I would suggest that it would be a good idea if this community were to ask for erm guidelines to be drafted for this committee to agree so that there is a more even fair, laid down procedure for dealing with the cases coming before the panel. Right, well we'll look into we'll look into that. Any other members got any comments on this? If it's a problem with numbers and why don't we extend the numbers on the panel? I mean No! Couldn't put the numbers up! Well I think that that is the problem is with how the is conducted who gets the first bite? Who puts their case first? Who Yeah. that that type of thing. I understand that but what I'm talking about. Three people on the panel is that right? Well t yes, and it has Well no I haven't got a problem I I have feelings about it, I I I mean, my, generally my experience I don't know I haven't discussed with other members but er, when I the panel that I er, allocated to erm and I was telephoned, could a make, and certain dates were made and I finally made one then I was told, oh no that's not convenient! At the end we er, of the day I had to opt out because it wasn't possible for me to fit in and someone else a , I'm just thinking of the time taken for er, er housing manager or one of his er, staff to erm er, you know, to do that practical thing that's all Oh yes that I'm of course it should! saying. But we'll look into er the format I think. Can we have a further report please? Yes, there's going to be a procedure and a report er is er and and we're going to have another report Frank, yes. Thank you er, very much. Right, now we get er back to the er, and we've got er, item which is er, the council's er response the proposed merger of the health er authority. Erm er, it's Vince . Thank you Chairer. Erm, the latest round of erm proposals to come before you as part of the N H S reforms are the consultation document that we we received recently and proposals to the merge the three existing area health authorities in North Essex to form one merged unit. We've attempted, Chairer, to assess this proposal and then to set a criteria I think it's important for members to understand that currently there is a consortium that er, is in operation, fully operational that is carrying out the tasks erm, that are identified in the consultation document mainly erm the consultation document itself does erm show exactly what the health authority is doing erm, the proposal now before you is to extend that erm to one merged unit of health authority with one executive board erm based with three local health clinics erm, to provide the service. We've made an assessment on the single reports, yeah and we're asking members to erm, give us guidance on the principles it and your response in order to, to get a response to the regional health authority by this Friday. Erm I do apologise for this but er unfortunately we have no choice I suppose . Right er, any comments from members er, from this er, report? Anyone Yes Chairer er I think Vince's report is a very fair summary of the er the the issues which face us erm truth is, is what we've been as in this proposed consortium which no doubt will go through with it's most of the reforms of the N H S despite the er consultation mechanism which they've gone through you know, but largely these are beforehand given the unaccountable of the N H S management! What we're actually lo doing here is those of longer members who remember we used to have a thing called the area health authority which was proposed in a three tier structure by a corporation called the McKenzie corporation at great expense charity governed by three quarters of a million pounds to invent structure of the National Health Service nineteen seventy two some years later they came back and said, well give us another million pounds and we'll go back and look at it again, and say actually we were wrong, and they abolished the areas, and produced districts! And what we're getting here actually is a recreation of the area health authority they're actually gonna be situated in the same office block where the old area authority used to be in Witham erm, and the community health council which I represent this authority on has certainly been er, raising a number of questions about this for fear of centralisation in Witham, erm with perhaps the lack of accessibility to local needs of West Essex and in Harlow particularly,. The question that the senior, the middle management staff will propose the authority, has been drawn almost exclusive , exclusively from North East and the Mid-Essex health authorities and not from West Essex. Cos, of course, the West Essex management staff have been co saddled with another project which is to provide a trust for the East Herts and West Essex health providers, i.e. P A H and associated health services providers and surprise surprise!in this council chamber Chief Executive of the West Essex Health Authority has become the Chief Executive of the provider trust despite that, it's not gonna be approved by the Secretary of State, but certainly a conference which she's speaking at in , she is named as the Chief Executive! Actually, I didn't see the job advertised, I must admit, I was going to apply for it myself of course! Ah but, surprise surprise! It seems she's been appointed without any advertising which would seem to flow equal opportunities promises here, the government and the health service really believe in it! So because they don't like the sound of this the other two have drawn off their magic stone and got them into the top jobs in er consortium! Er now it claims, of course that this is a more efficient purchasing mechanism on behalf of the patients and the community of this area the problem is, of course, it depends what you mean by efficiency and the truth is, that we may get increased our purchasing in terms of frugal as they put it delicately our patients! But actually it doesn't tell you anything about the quality of the care which they're purchasing and the evidence that we are getting increasingly from the community health council is the experience of people of the health service is that actually the quality of the care is getting worse and this is not due to the staff in the health ee the more detailed plans coming to the next meeting of the e the more detailed plans coming to the next meeting of the for an operation er, four years, it should to be said er, she's been waiting despite the government's claim that all operations are done within two years er for very severe varicose veins and surprisingly enough she got them because of course most varicose have been removed her, the north-east Thames region erm, and er she turned up on the Wednesday and the operation had been postponed twice previously er, she was er gone through all the er, various tests which took her four hours cos she had to find all the places herself, there was nobody to show her to X-ray and various other places erm she was prepared for the op and then was sent home because there wasn't a bed available! And told to turn up the next morning, waited another four hours, finally a patient who'd had an operation for a serious gall bladder operation two days before hand was kicked out of his bed and sent home so that she would be put in the bed, given the operation! This is actually the state the of health service and the truth is that all of these organisational changes are really not gonna solve the basic problems of the health service which is under- funded and under-resourced. So, I think we should say we are sceptical, and I think the paper puts it correctly er, we are sceptical of whether the reforms of the first consortium in fact, is going to meet the needs in terms of new health area and I know that time will come, they're talking about the lot, it's gonna wonderful and that the our economies should get all I can say is that the likelihood is the only f the area committee er, so that residents can comment managers, but since we've already had a nine hundred percent increase in senior management in the health service in the past five years up from nine hundred to over ten thousand at a cost of fifty to two hundred and fifty million pounds I'm rather sceptical about that one as well! So, in general, I think we should be as sceptical er and critical of any of these proposed changes and the key point of course was the at the lack of accountability, but there'll be even less accountability one suspects in the new consortium. Final question perhaps we should raise is well is there actually gonna be a need for it in two three years time down the track? If all providers going into trusts and if all er purchasing gonna be done by fund holders, the majority of whom are confident at this stage they'll become fund holders what actually is the role of the purchasing consortium that be and role of the health authorities, as such er, other than perhaps to collect statistics in the future of our time the climbing and quality of the health service in this area? Thank you Hugh. Anyone who wants to Yes,? Thanks. Erm, I really feel that this consultation is coming more than a too late because we started on the slippery slope when the consortium was er first dreamed of o , you know about a year ago and set up in April and that really this is the sort of the inexorable next move, and this consultation is far far too late! Erm I think that Vince has raised of very personal questions that we have ask about this erm the question of local accountability of the health authority board that will be created by this the to service this new joint health authority, would in fact, be the size of the existing one for West Essex and we would ha , have only a third of the representation that we currently have the whole of West Essex we'll only have two non- executive members on the health authority board and I don't think that that is terribly accountable but certainly a considerable reduction on what we've got at the moment. Erm not only will people have to travel a lot further for treatment, as was admitted at the public meeting erm last Monday, here in Harlow but er if people want to is maybe they'll one or two less senior f the area committee authority they will have to travel to Witham or Colchester or whatever, by absolutely execrable public transport if they don't drive a motor car to actually attend those meetings and that's not democratic or accountable either! Erm on the financial side, I don't think savings of a hundred thousand pound or the pay an non-executive out of a budget of two and hundred eighty million for the total of the three health authority is actually a heck of a big saving to justify what's happening! Erm what this is really about, I think we all recognise this is the erm purchaser aim to increase their leverage in the contract situation as against the providers on the other side of contract and in fact, I think we ought to tie this very much more in with what this authority has been saying about the proposals of the trust on the provider side because I think that this is an argument against the whole district N H S trusts that we're getting, but it is encouraging the situation in which health authorities have purchasers on the other side of the contract are going to want to band together and merge to create a larger block in which to negotiate with their whole trust providers, I think this is a a very dangerous situation and think we needed to tie the two together as an argument there. Erm and i also need to be concerned that the health authority I think is claiming that this merger will actually give them a better erm size population for research purposes for for purchasing, however, I think that it may well be that particular health needs, people in West Essex and Harlow in particular which has, for example, a rapidly ageing population and therefore needs facilities had not been planned into the town by way of health erm, that those statistics, those pockets of need are going to get overlooked in a much more large and vast disparate statistical picture, stretching from Hertfordshire right across to the coast I think it's too big a sample and we need to make sure that our specific needs aren't going to be overlooked in all that. Erm it's quite clear there's going to be no more new money for patient care and without that I don't think we're going to get the increase in quality of service but that we actually need. I think also in those very tough times ahead I think it's a very difficult decisions to be made about what services are provided erm, and what operation people are actually going to be able to have done and I wonder how much local people are gonna have a chance to say anything about that in the situation in which their health service their health authority is based so far away. Erm I've mentioned accessibility, I would raise that again, I'm a non-driver erm it's easy to hop in a car and get from here to Chelmsford, if you want to do it by public transport it is a nightmare erm the meeting here on, on Monday which was very poorly attended, and I understand that's been the pattern right across the area, and I don't think the health authority is that interested in finding out what people have thought to be honest! Erm it is admitted that people are gonna have go much further to get their treatment ah, that was quite clearly stated as part of the the down side of it, and I don't think we can tolerate that until we've got a decent public transport system that's going to allow patients to get by public transport from here to Colchester or Witham or Clacton or wherever and er and their, their relatives and friends to be able to follow to visit them if you know, as necessary. Erm so that's a a whole of responses to to this, I think we need to be far more clear in our opposition to this, I think it's a very dangerous situation it's one that's happening across the country, we're not the only sufferers and I think consortia have been very dangerous things from the beginning, and are leading inextricably to the merger that we we put before us as a proposal tonight, and I think we really should be quite strenuous in our position to it. Thank you. Any other comments?? Simon? Hello . As you saying to us all only to be said interest in the matter i in the erm the merging matter to . The problem I've found with paper erm it was confusing, misleading and erm very misleading . Throughout visions of, people who also come out tonight there's there's been obviously er, a potential saving of a hundred thousand pounds on on members erm I I'm not gonna I don't that's right. That's your salary Simon! Yes. Yes. too closely I don't actually recall seeing in the er in the actual wo consultation documents erm funding is not one of the issues being addressed by the merger with . You went to the public meeting Simon, that's the problem! I'm sorry? You went to the public meeting, that is what They they said! They actually quoted a hundred thousand pound Er figure did they? can we just have er just one person talking please? Simon will you continue. They were . Sorry? What what the government, what the erm the consortium and paper's about er, is improving the, the identification band that was hanging over of of health care, once that recipe is will get much larger consortium er, it's much widespread of er, devotion, expertise er, er professionalism in in assessing health needs er think about one of those areas that have been saved from in West Essex over the last over the last few years and by going into a much larger group with more resources erm, there will, they will be able to actually er work er far, far more effectively in sorting out what's actually needed. One of the other things I found that people are conflicting in the paper erm is of people having to travel further erm if I can just yes, on pa , on page three, paragraph this is the choice that seems of the area and the travel and on page four, paragraph one the version says that local people will still get a choice of i in the London hospitals. We could only er er, in it's not quite clear whether erm we're in favour of sending people all the way down to London for their health care, but we're not in favour of sending anywhere,anywhe where more local for the the erm, you know I, I'm not quite sure what you want you know what what point the lady's trying to get across there. In Er In a minute Vince if but recent problems on . . I know they propose Then o on page five I found a quote that there was nothing particularly in the consultation document for merger referring to finance apart from the increase coming from the changes and that question er, the, I take your points er, in fact referring to the and provider unit. Well in when you're considering the the possible merger of the three health authorities, they haven't positioned any one particular private er, provider unit is, is not really the crucial issue at hand! If you wanna make a point about that well well we'll point about them erm there is er a comment erm in this erm erm yeah on paragraph, paragraphs four and five, page five the first of we will buy them including all the legislation that will reduce and if you got up to page three, paragraph six there's a claim that levels are eight percent higher on the same money! But you know,the these people ha have hardly been treated erm and a, a contract for obtaining more health care year by year so, you know if yo , if you're saying that erm these wi will will reduce or that the action has already taken place, it can't reduce erm so, then again it's, it's not really relevant to erm the proposal of running a, a health authority, you know, these people should talk . Erm I've, I I think I'll erm was talking about people attending the health authority meetings at the moment but the local health authority do move meetings around, Saffron Walden Bishop's Stortford, Harlow and and and one over at erm and this apart from it's was only us coming from Harlow at the meeting last week and the health authority met in Harlow er, you know the me the meetings are moving about, they are there for people to come to but if they're not coming to to the meetings while they're o on on the doorstep then, then really what else can the health authority do to me , to make people come? You know I erm Hugh was talking about erm somebody being thrown out of hospital after gall bladder operation after only two days well fortunately these days there are one or two strives in er in in health care erm to erm which is very much easier to er, operate on people if you're if you if you're going to put them out cos the operation's more er simpler it's far less stress on patients and and, and they they're becoming a lot quicker er, clearly if faded out er, the way is completed then er obviously things are serrated with with the chief executive of the health authority and I'd like to give you this October when when the Chief Executive was . ! Yes. Best person I think , you know. Erm there is just one, may I just er, make one final point erm paragraph on page four refers to improvements in services of minority groups and also on page five and six the need for sa input, input into priorities shall not be able to for this . One of the main purposes of o of a consortium is actually looking at the health needs erm it's impressions that I've I actually got o on a number of occasions that I've er I think involvement in assessing health needs but I've actually answered anywhere er, and I'd very interested as to how or what kind of input erm we will be looking to on that? Thank you, er Simon. Er er if they want to come back on anything Hugh? Do , do you, no? No, no, I mean No, right. I could come back and then Yes. can I say to Simon that Er, but is, are there any other questions before er er on the report that er Dermot and Vince has I think we ought to have a an adequate response Chairperson to the Yes, well just a minute! I want er, I'm just asking if er, anyone's got er, comments to make to Vince and then Vince will reply to them, that's the point, he's got to reply to some of the comments er, that er Simon has made and then we'll come to what we want our response to be. So as there's no other comments er, Vince would you have you got any? Yes Chairman, the figure of a hundred thousand as we said did, was erm a figure quoted on by account chief's executive of the purchasing consortium erm, that was spoken at a public meeting held here in Harlow last week erm the issue of the the transport around the area erm, was accepted by the the chief executive of the health authority erm or of that of the consortium erm, and the and the view that it would be much more difficult with the lack of public transport to get to the more relo , remote areas of Essex the the reason that the erm reduced use of London was put into this report was also erm, clearly stated by the chief executive,i it's their clear aim to provide more of, to purchase more of the services from within the north Essex area, and that was stated in a major part of the conta , of of their erm achievements and that automatically means a reduced amount of choice for those people who would otherwise for, to London. Erm it is er fair to say that London's far easier to get to er, from Harlow than certain areas in Essex are erm, those are direct comments from the chief executive of the proposed erm health authority. The financial position of the provider, this was erm well in the report because the consultation document that was it quotes a figure o of erm, in the amount of patient's treated erm, with the same amount of money. However, one has to bear in mind that at the last meeting of the West Essex Health Authority erm they are saying that they can't carry on treating the same amount of people erm, because they're overspend already this year and that they will not treat these er, extra contractual referrals without prior funding being approved and that was co , that was actually stated at the meeting last week. Erm, so that that was put in the meeting to show a balance, if you like, between, yes they've achieved an eight percent but over last two years the providal unit have run deficit and erm one interacts with the other and that was, that was also something that er that's Erm not true. The last thing I would say Chairer on the erm, what else can the authority do? Health authority meetings can't, they aren't very well publicised erm and in fact, sometimes we have go over and, and get our own agendas and er I would suggest that perhaps would it be possible for them to be much better publicised than they currently are? Yes. Thank you Vince. Now, er erm are there any members who want to add to er what's er, has been written in er this er response? I think that er Vince has has raised a point about er erm, informing er and consulting local people and to let local people know erm when the meetings are then local can't go, I'm sure that if they really wanted people to come they'd make it much more er, in erm with the advertising so clear that er people would be able to and also if they had it at the times when a their meeting at the times when it was mostly convenient to er, the general public. Hugh, do you want to comment? Yeah I was gonna move erm on a suggestion that we had not been convinced of the need for this consortium by er, so far and and that certainly we as an authority er, have remained opposed to it on the grounds that we've stated the terms of accountability in terms of the er, sensitivity to local needs in terms of transport issues and in terms of the clear intention to restrict patient choice erm which I think is a key think which should be emphasised Yes. the evidence that we've found out already from C H C is that the operation of the N H S reforms has restrictive patient choice because crucially those referrals to London teaching hospitals which used to made as a matter of course if treatment is unable er, unavailable in Harlow have actually been largely stopped, I got the detailed figures from the purchasing director erm er, recently in the C F C minutes and it shows a miniscule number of patients being referred to London teaching hospitals erm, and this is clearly the reason as this points out in this paper that London teaching hospitals are in serious financial problems and four of them, indeed are being threatened with closure by the Tomlinson report and I think many patients in Harlow would much rather as er, people have pointed out, go to er, Middlesex and U C H, should they still exist than to go to Colchester and er, but this is this a key question, so on the the basis of the this consortium doesn't meet those criticisms indeed,make the situation worse I move that we oppose it in principle that Vince reports on that line. So seconder for that? Seconded. Seconded, yes but Lorna? Erm ya, I mean I've already had what, I've had what I've had to say about the the the content of the thing I was merely going to ask where we go from here? I'm aware that our backs are up against the wall as regards time because the response is meant to be in by Friday erm I don't think actually that this is the the paper that Vince is presenting, although in fact, surely raises issues, I don't think it is actually response as it stands, I think it is a paper which raises items of issues for this committee to consider, I don't think in itself it serves as a response. Erm I wonder how substantially it's going to re-written, first, in order to make it a response rather than an issue raising paper and ah, secondly, in the light of what we've all had to say this evening and, if it is to be re-written I wonder erm who is going to actually see it and approve it before it goes off in time to get to the health authority by the day after tomorrow? Well that's er cos normally they a matter will be er that we going to fight er, easily er so I mean i , it meant that the er, that er er some more should be brought out so that it er does er adhere to what er these er er government departments er expect as a response rather than er er as this considered issue raising er, we can er facilitate that er quite er easily but er I think er the the main point is what Hugh has said, that er we opposed it because it's not going to help in my view it's not going to help er the patients, the patients are not going to come off any better as a result of er, these er er what I would say and I feel and er the, I I I'd like to know what er the GP's think about cos GP's usually erm er, advise their patients if they have to wait a long time from one hospital, they would advise them to go into London and er, if that's been stopped as been er that's been stated erm then erm, er the GP's are not going to feel very happy about their patients er, getting er erm a lesser service. So, the patients and our residents are our main er concern and er, if we all er, oppose it in principle and er, er er then er let us see how we'll erm er, revamp this er response. Alright? Jim? Yes Jim? considering, I mean, there is a closing date quite quick Mm. well may I propose that we put all this along of the lines with flexible that they expressed the committee tonight and use ? Exactly! We use Right, thanks. Er, I don't know if you er, meant er er er the various plans to achieve er,i in that order but I certainly want obey patient's choice er, er er a a at first that's the reasons I've found. Well yes, that will come out er . And and you mentioned GP's, I mean, this is one way of almost perhaps forcing some GP's to become er erm a fund holders, because then they can go an an an and buy their er er patient care from wherever they the they want to! But this er er er if they're not fund holders that they er er er and then it's a way out for er . Yes. Yes. Right, thanks er, Ann. Right, we agree with erm Agree. . Thank you very much. On the next er, item er, the er erm an elective member to represent the council on the purchasing strategy group ee er er you would I would like the move . Well, I was going to say we're take it to council alright? Alright. Yeah, okay. Erm, can I ? Yes. And I've kept . And now last week. erm on the next er, item er we have er on item ten we've got the welfare rights and er advice and we've got quite a long report which I hope you'll agree is an excellent report, er and er Sue is here to present it. Sue please? Page seventeen to ninety four. Erm because the report is er quite a long report mainly the er part of the report erm I will pick out the most important comments and if I could take the first part of the report first erm this concerns a new staffing structure between er, newly emerged welfare rights and advice service. Erm the council erm, the welfare and associate advi advice centres since nineteen seventeen eight however, until March of this year erm the staff the counter staff within the advice centre were divided into to two departments er, the information and community services department reported to committees and, as a result of the general move within the council and the service department to er neighbourhood erm offices and called the support services. We were asked to erm come up with a new structure erm, and and it, the purpose of this report and to put that . The I think the erm the main point that I'd like to make is that erm the structure as it's posed erm is for the same number of staff erm, however, the three, what were supervisory stroke managerial posts erm have changed, we feel, as a result of the merger and therefore, and there are three er little posts mainly, a head of, people called a head of and a head of the support, support a support services manager and a support services officer and erm the appendix details the main er, functions in each post, er those posts. But erm certainly they er if they are er, graded as we anticipate there will perhaps be a small saving, in fact, as a result of the merger. And I think they are graded slightly higher than the as , they they will come out at the same cost, same overall costs. And the new structure erm moves towards erm team working across the advice centre composes of three teams er and also, takes on the critical self managing team so that erm in terms of the this work and technical support that er, has in the past been offered by a team leader, er, team leader and advice centre manager that will be, in the future will be offered by a senior member of staff erm, for each other and for less experienced staff . The teams will er, in the service part, which is the second part of this report is, is who ? Erm the the service channel will be divided into the three teams and the teams will be expected to deliver erm an agreed level of service within the which ever is available . So chaired the first part of the report I recommend that the structure as outlined erm, be approved and that the necessary recruitment take place as soon as possible. Er, I understand that if that those recommendations are approved this evening that that will then go to erm council staffing erm, which is currently erm, decided the overall er, priorities intended . Okay, I don't know whether I repeatedly er, members of the council like to ask questions about the structure so they can ask, and I can move on, so The next, well I'll give them tha , er ja , er Jim, yes? Yeah,I I will take only part of this debate as my daughter works in . Alright Jim Okay. Er, Ann, yes? Now personally I understand that the benefit shop is o er er er will be moving to the advice dispensing of centre shortly. Er, what co-operation or a ar ar ar ar you,? The these could of been yeah, they were bringing er er an , I'm bringing it in because I Ann I'd rather you keep the reports if you don't Yes. mind! An and perhaps for that, I've never heard that one before! . Or or jumping up the council's face! The the the the the the of the Benefit Shop, I make people advice and several of us were set on, on on on er er that you handled recently er er er er i it was the . Am I allowed? Yes, you can. Yes, but er we're really dealing er with Yes. the advice centre and what has happened to with erm er, I've er, if you've read the reports you'll see that er, that had been working er under er er er a considerable amount of er er stress and strain. Erm there's been a reduction er, in the er, staff er because er er people have moved on and er, I take Sue's point about er if it weren't for the fact that erm they'd got fully e e experienced staff who've been there some time, they haven't, not used to this churning over o of, and therefore, that has paid off in er in er in erm so far as being able to deal with the problems that have arisen and er, you'll see further on er, addition profiles of the work that's been done with er in this area over the town . Er, the, so something must be done quickly, I fear, about the er, management er of er, er the, the new structure and I hope you would agree to it unless anyone else has got, yes? Er i i is Harry? council gonna erm pose it in the areas closer to it ? Well, er that's been, that's been outlined in er er,i in the er, the report! Yes, but I think . All, all I wanna ask really is that erm er, is the staff happy with it? I mean that's the main thing,i in that staff . As long as you that situation, I mean that's the main thing. Well that it means that we've got, there's going to be er, a certain amount of extra staff though required, that's what's in in the report. Well you can start by not depending on the structure er er the structure of which Susan's speaking Yes. Yeah. seems to me is a very sensible organise the system most effectively er whether there's any but that's not affecting the structure. bit And the the structure. I've just asked Sue, I'm sure you wrote this with the full support of your staff? Yes. Yes. Well I'll second what Peter said. What did you say again? Erm,structure. And very system Just a minute! structure is the the the er Sue wants to write it down what you've said are you moving that we Yes, that er, the recommendations that er , presumably our service approved which has got structure in it, does that er Yes. Bu but Chairer it's not a practised little structure it's a guaranteed performance and what's it committee. They do that with this recommendation. Sorry? The the It's not the practice, the questions of structure guarantee performance erm P and Q committee . Er, yes but er er, I under stand that this is going to Yes, you've said that I mean to er another panel isn't it? It's going to be erm In actual fact, Jim is right it's slightly complicated. Service plans come with relevant committees, being this one in this case but structures and structures strictly speaking, are still the remit of P and Q, so I think it might be front of Chi, then holds red ring over stacker] [looks at book then watches red ring] *MOT: [laugh].

The boys cheered enthusiastically as the lynx, coughing and snarling, was pulled over on its back and straightened out with its free legs clawing the air. Bill ordered the lads to hold the pole, and keep the lynx prostrate until he inserted a gag between its jaws and tied its feet. He warned them against giving any slack, and said he might be seriously clawed should they make the slightest blunder. Stretched out with one foot fast in the trap and the choking circle of buckskin about its neck, the lynx was prevented from rising by the boys, who pulled vigorously on the pole. All the while the lynx was thrashing about madly in a useless struggle to free itself. Working with lightning-like rapidity, Bill soon had the thick, muscular legs tied and drawn securely together. Then, having cut a hardwood gag, two inches thick and four or five inches long, he waited his chance, and slipped it between the jaws of his snapping captive. Next he took a piece of buckskin and passed it about the gag and around the head and jaws of the helpless lynx. Having rendered the creature harmless, Bill cut two long, heavy poles. These he placed on the ground parallel to each other and about three feet apart. Across them he lashed shorter poles, close together, to form a platform. Releasing the trap from its leg, Bill and the boys dragged their still defiant prisoner to the rough stretcher, and soon had him securely bound in place. Then they shouldered the poles, and, carrying the captive between them, they started for the cabin. The lynx was heavy and the country rough, and before they had gone far the lads began to realize that they had a hard job on their hands. But they stuck to it, and finally, with aching shoulders, they arrived before the door of the little shack and set down their burden with a sigh of relief. “We’ll have to build a good, stout crate to ship him in, and, meantime, we’ll leave ‘his royal highness’ tied up so he’ll do no harm,” said Bill, opening the door. Moze instantly rushed out and hurled himself upon the prostrate lynx before any one could stop him. The trapper seized him by the neck and pulled him off, else he would surely have killed the helpless animal, which was entirely at his mercy. “I’m afraid we’ll have our own troubles before we get that gray villain off our hands,” laughed Bill. XIV A LYNX MAKES TROUBLE A day was spent building a substantial cage of heavy logs. With some difficulty the lynx was placed inside it, to wait until Bill could borrow a team and haul it to the railroad. Meantime a three-inch fall of snow had made ideal tracking conditions. As the boys were anxious to follow the fresh trails of the various animals, they determined to take advantage of it, and decided to remain at home while Bill made the round of his traps. They told him they would travel about in the neighborhood of the cabin and see what they could find. The trapper gave them permission to do so, and carefully explained the lay of the land near-by. When he had gone the boys started out, accompanied by Moze. They carried their rifles, a supply of matches, and a substantial lunch. Choosing a prominent landmark for their goal, they trained their compass on it, and entered the inviting confines of the great white wilderness. They had not gone far when they came to three piles of grouse feathers beneath a towering hemlock. They stooped down to examine them in the hope of finding a clue to the murderer. There were no footprints near these mute evidences of crime; but George discovered some faint, indistinct tracings across the snow. He and Ed studied them for some time, at a loss to know what had made them. “I have it!” cried Ed, straightening. “Have what?” queried George, doubtfully. “Why, those marks have been made by wing-beats. The murderer is some pirate of the air--a hawk, or near relative of ‘Old Snowball,’ I’ll bet!” “I believe you’re right,” agreed George, looking up into the tree-tops, as though he expected to see the bold marauder still about. Just then they heard the noisy commotion of a flock of jays, and they instantly made their way in that direction. They recalled the advice of Ben regarding these birds, and stole noiselessly toward the calls, confident of finding game at the end of their stalk. The jays did not appear to be moving, for their cries came continually from the same place. Stealing cautiously along from tree to tree, the lads at length came in sight of them. Standing motionless, they saw the jays flying angrily about some large, dark-colored object in the top of a tree. “Look! It has ears!” whispered Ed, excitedly, as an erect tuft appeared on each side of the broad, flat head. “It’s an owl of some sort; and see--it’s holding a grouse,” said George. The jays made many vicious swoops; but the owl always turned its head in time to meet them, and the boys distinctly heard the angry snap of its powerful beak. “Well, here goes for the murderer!” declared Ed, raising his rifle. “If he had taken one grouse we might have let him off; but three are too many for one meal. He’s a ‘tenderfoot’ and a ‘game-hog,’ and, according to Ben, either charge is enough.” But the owl evidently had other ideas. Just as Ed pulled the trigger it flew, and his bullet cut the branch directly behind where it had perched. It sailed swiftly away among the trees, with the jays in close pursuit. “Shoot first and talk afterward,” cautioned George, laughing at the discomfiture of his friend. Moze was baying somewhere off to the right of them. They left the owl to the tender mercies of the jays, and turned toward the hound. They went down into a rocky ravine, across a little brook, and up a hill. Then they heard Moze coming up the other side. Hiding themselves in some bushes, they waited for the appearance of the hound and his quarry, which he seemed to be driving directly toward them. His voice rang out clearly in the frosty air, and the blood of the young hunters tingled. What he was running they did not know, and they waited in suspense. Suddenly a red streak flashed across the opening in front of them and immediately disappeared into the brush again. The boys grinned sheepishly at each other. Moze followed a minute later, and, glancing at them from the corner of his eye, he raced on in pursuit of the fox. “Say, we’re getting pretty bad,” declared Ed, lowering his rifle. “That’s all right, I didn’t guarantee to hit a streak of lightning,” replied George, looking after the fox. “It’s no use waiting for Moze; he’ll be on the other side of the world by night if he keeps up that pace.” They resumed their journey through the woods, and near the border of a small swale they jumped a “snowshoe rabbit.” “There goes just the fellow we have been looking for!” shouted Ed, as the nimble hare bounded away. “Let’s follow him up,” urged George. “No, thanks; no more swamps for me!” said Ed, shaking his head. “Oh, come on; this is a tiny one--you can almost see across it. We can’t possibly get lost,” persisted George, eager to follow the hare. He finally won Ed’s consent, and together they plunged into the swale. This time they prudently chopped small squares from the tree-trunks to serve as sign-posts when they wished to return. “We’ll never come up with him. Just look at those leaps,” said Ed, hopelessly. “He may get tired, and perhaps he’ll squat down somewhere,” suggested George. Much to their satisfaction, they quickly crossed the narrow bit of marshy forest and came out at a sunny slope along its border. Here George spied the hare squatting under a low bush. Taking careful aim, he killed it with the first shot. They were delighted with their trophy, and George tucked it into the pocket of his coat with much pride. They had no trouble retracing their course, and, once out of the swamp, sat down to enjoy their lunch. They had seen or heard nothing of Moze, and George laughingly declared he would soon be around the earth on the same trail. After lunch it began to grow cold, and they decided to return to the cabin and await Bill with his spoils from the traps. The lads followed their back-trail, and were soon in sight of the little log shelter. They went at once to the cage containing the lynx, and when they reached it, drew back in alarm. The savage inmate had chewed and clawed two bars of his prison until they were all but in half. The merest push or jump of the lynx would snap them asunder and gain him his freedom. “Great Scott! What shall we do?” cried Ed. “Don’t go in front of it,” advised George. “If you do, he’ll jump; and then, out he comes! We’ll sneak up from the side, throw our coats over the front of the cage and run into the cabin with it.” “Hurry! He’s getting ready to spring!” warned Ed. Creeping up to it from the sides, the boys each grabbed an end of the heavy crate. Pulling and tugging with all their might, they managed to drag it into the cabin. Hardly were they over the threshold, with the door securely fastened behind them, when the lynx did the very thing they feared it might do--it jumped against the front of the cage! There was an ugly snarl, a snapping of weakened logs, and the released captive bounded into the center of the room and faced them. The boys made record time out through the doorway. Once outside, they slammed the door shut and stood looking at each other with troubled faces. “The window, quick!” screamed Ed. George immediately ran to it and hung his coat over the outside, in the hope of preventing the lynx from jumping through the sash. Then he hastily rejoined his friend, who stood braced against the door, anxiously awaiting some sound from within. “Well, this is a pretty mess!” he declared, when George came up. “Yes, but it’s lucky we got here when we did,” said George. “Maybe not so lucky as we imagine. I’ve an idea there’s going to be considerable of a ‘rough-house’ before things become settled. Besides, there are plenty of lynxes in the woods, and perhaps it might have been better to have killed this one when he jumped from the crate.” “But he doesn’t belong to us,” George reminded him, “and you know the trouble Bill took to capture him. I’m sure he wouldn’t thank us for shooting it in his absence.” So far the lynx had remained passive, and the boys were at a loss to know just what it was doing. At last curiosity got the better of them, and Ed tiptoed to the window and peered in. With a startled yell he jumped away, stumbled, and fell in a heap. He had gazed directly into the snarling face of the lynx, which was crouched on the narrow window-sill. Luckily, the animal was as much surprised and frightened as the boy, and instead of crashing through the glass it sprang away from it. Then pandemonium broke loose, and by the noise that came from inside the boys knew the lynx was making sad havoc of the few furnishings. Pans clattered and clanged to the floor; the table went over with a bang; and in dismay they heard various pieces of crockery tumble from the shelves as the lynx leaped wildly about the little room. At one time he must have alighted on the hot stove, and he gave evidence of the fact by a scream of pain. Then he crashed against the door, and the boys threw their combined weight against it. Then he quieted down. Ed and George were anxious to see the damage he had done, but dared not peer through the window, lest they invite an attack. It grew bitterly cold, and they were obliged to stamp their feet and swing their arms to keep their blood circulating. Several long hours dragged by, and the short winter day came to a close. Still they kept vigil on the outside of the cabin. Again and again the lynx stirred things up, and once their hearts almost stopped, when they heard him strike against the window. It was evidently a glancing blow, for it did not break the glass, and the lads breathed a sigh of relief. “I wish Bill would show up,” said Ed, swinging his arms and blowing on his benumbed finger-tips. “Say, suppose he doesn’t come until to-morrow; you know he said he sometimes stayed overnight at a lean-to.” “Gee whiz, I never thought of that!” cried Ed, in alarm. “We can’t spend the night out here without freezing, and we can’t go inside without killing the lynx! We’re in a bad fix anyway you look at it.” As darkness gradually settled over the silent white forest the hearts of the boys became heavy. With the fading of daylight the imprisoned lynx became more active, and once more wild riot raged within the dark room. The temperature dropped steadily, and the shivering young guards were at a loss to know what to do. Even if they decided to take possession of the cabin by killing its dangerous occupant, their chances of doing so were now poor. “We’ve got to do something--I’m actually freezing to death; and, besides, it seems ridiculous to be turned out of our own home by a great big bully of a cat,” said Ed, through chattering teeth. “It is pretty tough; but what are we going to do?” asked George. “We haven’t even a lantern, and it’s no place in there to go poking around with a flickering little match.” Just then they heard the crunch of footsteps on the dry snow, and a moment later Bill stood beside them, a big bundle of furs strapped to his back. “What’s the matter?” he inquired, anxiously. “I missed the light, and was afraid something must be wrong. Thought maybe you were lost again. Come in. What on earth are you shivering out here for?” And he started to open the door. “Wait!” cried Ed, excitedly grasping him by the arm. “Hold on!” warned George, barring his way. “What in blazes--” began the bewildered trapper; but the boys interrupted him with a hurried recital of facts. A council of war was immediately held, and Bill was forced to admit that things looked bad. He said he had little hope of retaking the lynx alive, and he seemed much cast down at the idea of killing it. Then he unslung his pack and drew a keen-bladed ax from it. He made known his intention of entering the cabin, and told the boys, who were eager to accompany him, that they would be in the way and might get hurt. Bill eased their minds by promising to call them if he got into serious trouble. They opened the door just wide enough for the trapper to squeeze through. When he had entered, they slammed it shut and waited nervously for sounds of the fierce battle they felt sure would immediately begin. They heard Bill strike a match, and for a second a bright flicker of light showed through the cracks in the door. Then it passed, and all was dark. The lynx began growling fiercely as Bill moved about the room in search of the lantern. At last a steady, bright glare lighted up the interior of the cabin, and they knew he had found it. Instantly the battle started, and, judging by the noise of combat, the listeners believed it was a deadly one. They heard the lynx spring times without number, and each time they heard Bill jump out of its way. He was no doubt trying to stun it with the ax, so that he could again take it alive. Unable to restrain their impatient curiosity longer, the lads made their way to the window. Cautiously they rose on tiptoe and peeped into the cabin. They saw Bill partly crouched, with the ax in his hands. One sleeve of his hunting-shirt was ripped and torn, where the sharp claws of the lynx had fastened in it. Following the fierce, steady gaze of the trapper, the boys saw the lynx squatting behind an overturned stool. It had made a sad wreck of the place. All about lay the results of its vengeance. Pots and pans were scattered in wild disorder over the floor, the table had been overturned on top of its contents, and even the personal belongings of the rightful occupants had been ripped from their places and strewn about promiscuously. Bill slowly approached the crouching lynx, and the boys heard it growl like a big, angry cat. Cautiously the trapper advanced, and they saw him turn the ax in his hand, as though to strike with the blunt end. [Illustration: CAUTIOUSLY THE TRAPPER ADVANCED] Suddenly the lynx sprang at him, and he stepped aside and swung his weapon, but missed. Landing in the center of the room with all four feet beneath it, the snarling creature instantly rebounded, and Bill had barely time to whirl and face the attack. He knocked the determined animal from him with a powerful blow of his ax. It slunk back into a corner, apparently unhurt, and again crouched, with fangs exposed and eyes blazing. Then something unexpected happened, as a new combatant took a hand in the fray. The door suddenly swung in, and Moze rushed into the room and jumped for the throat of the lynx. He had arrived home from his long chase, and had heard the savage snarls inside the cabin, and, entering, had bounded joyously into the fight. As the surprised trapper ran to close the door the hound and its adversary came together; Bill, unable to use his ax for fear of killing Moze, hopped out of the way of the fighters. The boys, proud of the courage displayed by Moze, cheered him on. The two powerful animals were well matched, and the battle was a hard one. They fought all over the room, first one gaining the advantage, then the other. Gouging, snapping, clawing, and snarling, they kept on mauling each other. Once the lynx got Moze beneath it, and would no doubt have speedily ended his career had not Bill aimed a savage kick at its ribs. His action diverted the animal’s attention for an instant and gave the hound a chance to regain his feet. Both combatants were torn and bleeding. Again and again the trapper sought to deal the lynx a fatal blow with the sharp edge of the ax, but Moze was always directly in the way. At last they drew apart for a moment, and Bill seized the opportunity and rushed upon the great snarling cat with his ax raised. He was unwilling to see Moze further punished in the terrific fighting, and he determined to end it and save his faithful old hound. When he came within a few feet of it, the lynx jumped directly at his throat. This time, however, Bill did not miss, and his powerful blow buried the blade of the ax deep in the brain of the savage cat, which crashed to the floor in a lifeless heap. Then the shaking, half-frozen boys rushed in and ran to Moze as he stretched out close to the stove to lick a score of painful wounds. “Well, old boy, he came near doing you,” said Bill, tenderly, as he knelt to examine the injuries of the brave old fighter. “Wouldn’t there have been fun if we had gone in before you arrived,” laughed Ed, as he huddled over the stove, trying to thaw out. “Fun and scratches, likely,” laughed Bill. “These big lynxes are just about as mean a proposition as roams the woods--that is, when you get them cornered for a fight.” “It’s too bad you were obliged to kill him after all the work of taking him alive,” said Ed, as he stooped down and ran his fingers through the long, soft fur. “Well, it couldn’t be helped. You see, there are many more lynxes to be had, but there is only one Moze. One or the other had to go, and I guess we know whose side to fight on. Don’t we, ‘old spit-fire’?” and Bill patted Moze affectionately. By the thumping of his tail on the floor, the boys knew the hound understood this compliment to his valor, and was well content with the way things had turned out. XV BILL CAPTURES A PRIZE The boys had been with Bill for some weeks when George took out his diary. He was obliged to count back to learn the exact date; and when he had done so, he uttered a long whistle of astonishment. “What is the matter?” inquired Ed. “Why, we are due at Ben’s the day after to-morrow, and, by ginger, the day after that will be Christmas!” “Good gracious, how the time has flown!” said Ed. Bill was strangely silent, and the boys watched him as he sat playfully tickling Moze. “Of course, if you can’t take us back then, why, I guess we could stay here another day; only we promised Ben,” explained Ed, thinking that perhaps their sudden decision had interfered with the plans of the old trapper. “No; no, that’s all right. I’ve got to go out with these furs, anyway. I’ll get around to-morrow and spring my traps, and we can pull out early the next morning,” he said. “And you and Moze must spend Christmas with us!” cried George, enthusiastically. Again a strange silence came over the trapper, and he walked slowly away toward the door. “Maybe you have other plans; and, of course--” began Ed; but Bill interrupted him. “No, I’ve no plans, son; I never make them any more, ’cause, you see--” he paused and looked at them out of misty, troubled eyes, and they instantly understood. “But we’ll do it this time! Won’t we, Moze?” he laughed, suddenly, and the hound rose and wagged his tail. The next day was to be a busy one, and with the first gray streak of dawn they were away on the trap line. About an inch of snow had fallen during the night, and the trapper pointed out many new tracks as he hurried along. “Do you see that trail there, the little footprints, two by two?” he inquired. The boys said they did. “Well, that was made by a mink. See, here he’s stepped into one of his front tracks, and left only three footprints on the snow. That’s a great trail of his, always looks like he’d suddenly lost a leg.” It was a glorious winter day, and Bill was in high spirits. Nothing escaped his wonderful eyes, and everything seemed to contain a message, which he gladly read to the boys. He showed them the delicate, lace-like trails of the little wood-mice, and pointed to where one had tunneled its way beneath the snow in search of hidden seeds. Then he drew their attention to what looked like grains of pepper shaken over the snow. The boys were astounded when told that these minute black specks were tiny insects which woodsmen called “snow-fleas.” Bill said they lived in the moss, and could be seen with the naked eye only when they hopped about over a white background. Farther along they came upon the tracks of a moose which, Bill declared, had gone by that very morning. George proposed that they follow after it, but the trapper refused for two reasons; first, because the law was on, and secondly, because it was a cow moose. The boys asked him how he knew it was a cow, and he proceeded to explain the difference between the track of the cow and that of the bull. Bill said that, like the buck deer, the bull moose usually left a larger, less pointed track than his mate. And he explained further that the “dew-claws” of the bull were set wider apart, and so registered in the snow. The trapper declared that when the marks showed close together, as they did in the present instance, it was safe to presume that the tracks were those of a cow. Not wishing to break any game laws, the boys turned willingly from the tracks and continued on the trail to the traps. They came at length to the spring-hole where Bill had been trying for so long to catch the mink. Once more he was doomed to disappointment, and, springing the trap, he hung it on a near-by sapling, until he might return, and started on. Several times they crossed fox trails, which the lads had learned to distinguish at sight. Then they came upon a track that was entirely new to them. Bill laughed when they asked him to name it, and said it had been made by a skunk. The trail consisted of two continuous rows of footprints, one beside the other, and each print close up to the one before it. The trapper explained that this animal did not often venture forth in winter, except on warm, balmy days. At one of the sets Bill captured another lynx; but, as it was not a particularly large one, he despatched it with his hickory club. While they were eating their midday lunch a flock of sociable little chickadees gathered in the branches above, and, cocking their black-capped heads sideways, peered inquisitively down at them. The diners threw some crumbs and shreds of meat on the snow. Instantly the fearless chickadees accepted the invitation and dropped down to the feast. After a time, as the birds became bolder, the boys offered scraps of meat held between their fingers. They thrilled with pleasure when the confiding chickadees alighted trustfully on the outstretched hands and pecked energetically at the morsels offered them. Having finished their meal, the three trappers rose and continued the circuit of their traps. Everywhere the forest shone forth resplendent in its mantle of glistening white, where, on the telltale surface, was scrawled and dotted a complete record of woodland happenings. Helped and encouraged by Bill, the lads were soon able to read and decipher these code-writings of nature. The tread of a cautious paw, the sweep of a fluttering wing, or the mark of the passing wind was instantly noted and recognized. Thus the day wore on, and, though their toll of fur was not heavy, they had a goodly number of pelts by the time the shadows commenced to gather. There were still a number of traps to be examined, and in one of them Bill had hopes of finding the highest prize in the trapper’s lottery--a silver fox! He had seen one in the vicinity several times during the summer, and again early in the autumn before he set his traps. As the fur of the beautiful creature was comparatively valueless at such times, Bill had wisely refrained from destroying it. With the coming of cold weather and the trapping season, however, he had set skilfully concealed traps about the locality of its wanderings. Several of them had been deftly sprung and robbed of their bait. Bill, of course, blamed the silver fox, and each time he reset them with greater care, hopeful that he would eventually capture the idol of his dreams. Now, as they drew near the spot, the boys noticed that the old trapper unconsciously quickened his stride. He acknowledged that the fur of this fox would bring him in “quite a roll of money,” and the lads were most anxious for his success. “Wouldn’t it be fine if you got him for a Christmas present?” laughed George, as they hustled along. Bill smiled, but made no reply. Then he halted and, parting a fringe of bushes, stooped over and sprung an empty trap. “Number one, and nothing,” he said, a bit disappointedly. “Well, I’ve four more set for that black rascal, and we can’t tell what we’ll find,” he added, hopefully. “Black rascal? I thought you said it was a silver fox?” said Ed, somewhat puzzled. “So it is,” responded Bill; “but it’s black just the same. You see, the fur is tipped with silver-gray at the end of each guard hair, though the pelt itself is rich, glossy black. Looks like a black fox that has been caught out in a heavy frost,” he explained. Soon they came to the second trap, and their hearts beat hard with excitement when they heard some animal tumbling about in the bushes. Bill ran eagerly forward, club in hand, and the boys saw him deliver the fatal blow. Then, in response to their inquiry, he reached down, and, when he straightened, held up a long, reddish-brown body, somewhat smaller and slimmer than that of a fox. “What is it?” inquired the lads, though, of course, they knew it was not the hoped-for prize. “Fisher,” replied Bill, a satisfied smile on his face, “and a nice one.” While he proceeded to skin it the trapper explained the habits of the animal he had just caught. He said it was a skilled hunter, and that it was seemingly without fear, having been known to find and kill bear cubs larger and more powerful than itself. Bill pronounced it a great destroyer of game birds, rabbits, and small creatures in general. “Looks almost like a cross between a fox and a mink, don’t it gets to be an old story and is merely respect," returned the wise younger sister. "I am sure Arthur is fond of Jane and proud enough of her too, and look at brother Randolph! Oh, I just envy Jaqueline! What a nice time she will have!" Dolly had said so many times, "It's just awful, Marian," that she had nothing more left to say. Then, it was hard to be watched and questioned and not allowed any liberty on Marian's account. She didn't see how Marian could run away, for she was never trusted to go anywhere alone. And no well-bred girl would throw herself at her lover without a very urgent invitation. The clergyman and his wife came in to tea, and found Mr. Greaves there, and congratulated them both. Then the neighbors took it up as a settled thing, and poor Marian felt the net closing about her. There had been a vague half-expectation that Lieutenant Ralston would make some effort to assure her of his constancy. Or if some word could come from Jane! Louis went back to Williamsburg, and Patricia was sent for some educational advantages. There was a new little girl at the Jettsons', and Jaqueline was to be one of the godmothers. Afterward Jane pleaded so hard for her to remain. She could go on with her French and her singing, as she had a very pretty voice and singing was one of the accomplishments of the day. Then, too, the Carringtons were very glad to have her. Indeed, Jaqueline was a great favorite for her vivacity and her charming manner, which was so pretty and deferential to her elders, so bright and winsome to her compeers. Mrs. Mason took up the education of the two little girls with Charles' help. He went over to the house of the clergyman every morning, who was a graduate of Oxford and quite ready to piece out his salary with a class of five small boys in the neighborhood. Charles was a born student, delighted with all kinds of knowledge. Annis was always interested as well. "You will make the child a regular bookworm," declared the squire. And then he would take her and Varina off for a canter over the hills. "I don't see why girls and women shouldn't love to learn," Charles said to his mother. "But they can't be doctors, nor ministers, nor judges, nor politicians," smilingly. "They could help their husbands if they knew how." "But they help them by keeping the house in good order, and watching the servants, and sewing, and making their husbands comfortable and happy." "I want Annis to learn a great many other things, for you know I am to marry her when we are grown up," said the little boy gravely. Mrs. Mason smiled at his earnestness. A messenger had been sent down from the Pineries early in December to invite all the family to a Christmas dinner. Mrs. Floyd had not been in her usual health for some weeks back, and now that the cause of disagreement had been removed she was anxious to receive all the family that could come together. She had hoped to have Mr. and Mrs. Conway, but he could not leave his parish at such an important time. So, if they would waive their own family gathering and join her she would be most grateful. She realized that she and Mr. Floyd were getting to be old people, and they could not tell how much longer they might be spared. "Then it is all settled that Marian will marry Mr. Greaves," said Mr. Mason. His wife gave a little sigh. Jaqueline came home to hear the verdict and vent her indignation. Jane had received a letter from her father announcing that Marian had accepted the husband selected for her and given up her rebellious attitude. So the family, he hoped, would meet in amity once more. Mrs. Floyd had not been well of late, and was desirous of seeing her new little granddaughter. "Marian can't have given up so easily! And all this time Mr. Ralston has been so confident! What an awful disappointment it will be to him! He has gone up to Philadelphia to consult with some engineers. Oh, papa, can't something be done? Jane is almost wild about it." "My dear girl, if Marian is satisfied----" "But I cannot think she is. She did love Mr. Ralston so!" "A girl's fancy. How many lovers have you had? See how indulgent I am to trust you to Jane, who really hasn't much more sense than you." "Why, I haven't any real lover. And I do not want one for ever so long." Yet she flushed and dropped her eyes. Perhaps he would not have trusted his daughter in the giddy whirl of society if he had not known of someone every way worthy and acceptable, who was watching her and waiting for the right moment to speak. When she had taken her fling of gayety, she would be the more ready to listen. And he would not mar what he really desired by seeming to bias her inclinations. She was not a girl to be forced into a step or have her patience worn out, as he suspected was the case with his young sister Marian. "Of course Jane means to join the family party?" "Oh, yes. Jane has been almost heartbroken over the matter. She is very fond of Marian and Dolly. Oh, papa, I hope you won't get cross and queer as you grow older!" He laughed and patted her shoulder. "Grandfather thinks you will all come to grief from over-indulgence." "We are all going to come out magnificently in the end, just to prove him a false prophet and you the very dearest of fathers." "You are a sad flatterer, Jack. I'm afraid you learn too much of it in the gay circles. But you must be on your best behavior at the Pineries, and not stir up any disaffection. Family differences are very disagreeable things; and, after all, age is entitled to a certain indulgence and respect. I shouldn't wonder if you were a queer, arbitrary old lady yourself." "Oh, papa!" reproachfully. Patricia thought it very hard that she could not come home for Christmas, which was the great holiday of all the year. But Louis was not coming; he had some arrears to make up, and was also very much interested in one of a certain household of girls, and was to attend their Christmas-Eve ball. Patty grumbled a good deal. Aunt Catharine treated her like one of the children. She was not allowed to go to parties, and she had to learn all kinds of fancywork and cooking, and making sauces and everything. "And I've made up my mind if keeping a house is so much work I shall never get married," declared the much-tried girl. "And I think aunt was much nicer as an old maid than a married woman. Though she's a great personage now, and everybody comes to her for advice and patterns and stitches in lace-making and recipes for everything. If I ever did marry, I wouldn't be a clergyman's wife." Mrs. Conway wrote a rather stilted, but very affectionate, letter to her mother and Marian. She congratulated the latter warmly. Gray Court was certainly a fine old place. Four children were a great responsibility; she found her three a continual care, but Mr. Conway was so devoted to his study, his classes, and his sermons she could have no help from him. As they wanted certainly to come to the marriage in the spring, it was better to wait until then, as it was quite impossible to get away now. She sent Marian a piece of fine old lace that she had bought from a parishioner in very reduced circumstances, and who was the last of her line. The Pineries wore a welcome aspect for the guests. Great fires were kept blazing in the wide chimneys, and the Franklin stove in the hall sent out pleasant cheer. Brandon the son, his wife, and three children were among the first guests. The Masons added six, and Mrs. Jettson came with her three babies, but her husband was not to join them until Christmas morning, on account of some engagements. There was staying at the house a young Mr. Floyd, a distant relative from South Carolina. It was plain to be seen that he was very sweet on Dolly, and grandfather was highly elated. Mr. Greaves had certainly thawed a little. He was quite lover-like in a courtly and formal fashion, and made himself very much a son of the house. In arranging for the guests Mrs. Floyd had brought her two daughters next to her own room so there should be no chance for nightly gossips or confidences over dressing. Marian had begun to think a home of her own desirable. With the unreason of womankind she felt that Mr. Ralston ought to make some effort to learn her true sentiments. As he had not, as also her mother persisted that young society men of that class thought it entertainment to make love to every woman they met, she had yielded reluctantly. Then, too, Gray Court was a fine old place. It had not suffered much during the Revolution, though the treasures of plate and fine china had been buried out of harm's way. Marian found that she was the envy of the elder spinsters, and even the younger girls thought her lucky. So she had given in on condition that the marriage should not take place until May. "Honey, dat's an awful onlucky month!" said her old nurse. "Then it shall be June," returned the prospective bride. "And suppose I should be married at the same time! This is Preston Floyd's second visit, and he and father hit off wonderfully well. They agree in politics, and I wonder why it is such a pleasure to have the country go to ruin. However, I don't think it will; it has stood many storms. And Charleston must be an agreeable city to live in, if all be true that is said about it. I would like Philadelphia or New York, but I see no prospect of getting there. So if Preston asks me to marry him I shall accept. I don't suppose father would ever trust us to visit Jane again. And when you are gone it will be dismal. Marriage seems the right and proper thing. I wonder if Jaqueline has a lover!" A modern girl would have complained that Jaqueline made "big eyes" at Preston Floyd. Before she had been an hour in the house there was a different atmosphere. She was not aggressive, and her rather hoydenish ways were toned down to a certain fearless elegance. She was bright and vivacious and had bits of merry wit at her tongue's end, yet it was not so much what she said as her manner of saying it. "I can't get a word alone with Marian," complained Jane to the young girl. "But I must say that Mr. Greaves acquitted himself wonderfully well last evening. Only Mr. Ralston is so sure Marian will be faithful through everything. He gave me so many messages for her, and mother makes a great point of not mentioning his name. What shall I do?" "It's horrid! I do believe Marian has ceased to care for him. And now that everything is settled it would seem dreadful to stir it all up again. Papa insisted that I should let the matter entirely alone." "But Mr. Ralston will be so dreadfully disappointed. He was so proud of his new position for her sake. And Marian really puzzles me. She _seems_ content. Oh, did you see that exquisite lace Aunt Catharine sent her? Of course it _is_ all settled, and if Marian is satisfied--oh, Jaqueline, I hope you will really fall in love! I adore lovers, even if I am the mother of three children. I mean that my little girl shall have a delightful time when she is grown up." The children were having a gay time. Varina was the leader, and Annis, with her soft ways, the peacemaker, when anything went wrong. The two Jettson boys adored her. Charles roamed over the old house, and pleased grandfather by his interest in family legends and the history of various articles of furniture and plate. It was grandfather's boast that there wasn't a stick of Yankee furniture in the house. Charles longed to have Annis with him, but though grandfather said "she was a nice little thing," he did not take very fervently to little girls, and had more than once regretted that Jane and Marian had not been boys. "I don't see what you find interesting about those babies," Charles said rather disdainfully. "They're always wanting to tumble over you and make a noise, and they're never as funny as the little slave children, who _can_ amuse you if you want that sort of fun. I wish you'd come and hear grandfather talk about the Indians and when the settlers first came to Virginia." "I don't think he quite likes me," Annis said hesitatingly, with a nervous little laugh. "As well as he likes any child girls. I think he likes them better when they are big enough to play whist. But you could listen, all the same." "I get tired of just listening. I like the children because they are alive and can laugh and talk. The other people who have been dead so long----" "But you liked Captain John Smith, and the Froissart men who were so brave. And King Arthur----" "But Grandfather Floyd said there never was any such King Arthur, nor Merlin, nor ever so many other people." "Grandfather is wrong about some things. And it isn't polite to contradict him, because he is an old man. Oh, do come!" "Annis! Annis!" called two or three eager baby voices. "Oh, yes, I would rather be with them. And when we get home you may tell me all these things. They'll sound so much better than in grandpapa's voice. It sometimes gets shaky and seems cold, while yours is soft and sweet and fine when you come to the grand places." That mollified the boy, who certainly had become grandfather's favorite, and was pronounced sensible. CHAPTER X. A CHRISTMAS AUGURY. The slaves at the Pineries were kept with a rather strict hand. Very few were sold off the plantation, and then for the gravest misconduct, when whipping had ceased to be efficacious. But they had increased largely, and were often hired out, those for the year at Christmas or the beginning of the year. Christmas Eve there was a general gathering, and they were allowed a sort of ball in the great kitchen, where most of the rough work was done. There were music and song singing, charms were tried, and they ended with dancing. All the autumn it was looked forward to eagerly. The supper in the main house was early, and the smaller children were put to bed. The three Masons and young Archibald Floyd, who had his grandfather's name, were to be allowed at the "grand occasion." There were a number of guests, and seats around the outside were prepared for them. "And we used to open the dancing," said Jane. "How proud they were about young missy! And we tried some of the charms. Looking for your future husband in a pail of water with a mirror at the bottom. And jumping over the candles--do you remember that, Polly? What fun we used to have with the girls! Why, it is three or four years since I have been here at Christmastide." "Oh, will they jump over the candles?" cried Jaqueline. "They did it at the Fairfaxes' last year, and Betty put the very first one out." "Why, Betty must be two and twenty," said Jane. "It would be queer if the sign came true." "It doesn't really," laughed Jaqueline. "It is like tipping your chair over and tumbling up stairs." "I want to try it," declared Dolly. "If you go over the whole seven you are going to be married soon. The others count for years. And if you put the first one out you will surely be an old maid." Some of the songs were very pretty, some ridiculously funny, several embellished by pantomime. Then the charms began. The first few were rather simple, and caused an immense amount of giggling among the young Phillises. The shadow faces were pursued with a certain awe, as if they really were something uncanny. Dolly, Jaqueline, and a young lady guest were the only ones of the "quality" who cared to look. "It is as much your own shadow as anything," declared Jaqueline, "and it quivers so that you can hardly make it out." The candles were lighted and placed in a row at even distances. The young lads tried them first. There were no skirts in the way, and they went over them triumphantly. "But men can get mah'ied when they like," said Rose, Marian's pretty young maid, in her soft half-lisping tone, "but girls can't always." "Try, Rose!" exclaimed Jaqueline. "I doan know anyone I want. An' I'm promised to go over to Gray Court with Miss Mayan." "You'll find someone there, perhaps." Bathsheba, tall and supple, with the figure of a Greek sculpture, went over the seven triumphantly. Sam caught her by the hand, and a shout went up, echoing in a laughing chorus. Others tried it with varying luck, evident mortification, and disappointment. There were some who had been practicing in secret the whole week, and were well prepared. "Now I am going to try," said Dolly; and there was a general applauding among the slaves. The space was made a little larger, though eyes were eager and necks were craned; and broad smiles illuminated black and brown faces. "Way for Miss Dolly now. She goin' ober de whole row. Whoop, now!" and Jep gave his knee a resounding slap. Dolly gathered up her skirts. The first jump was a success, the candle only flaring a little. The second--then some clapping began. The third dainty leap brought more applause, then on and on until she had cleared the mystical number. Shouts and laughter almost shook the roof. "I knew you could do it, Miss Dolly," said Rose, in exultation. "And Miss Mayan can, too." "Now you will see my luck," and Jaqueline stepped out on the floor. "One--two." Out went the third candle, but Jaqueline kept on and put out the fourth. She had half a mind to be angry. "Well, two years isn't long to wait," remarked Dolly consolingly. "It isn't the waiting. I don't see how I could have been so stupid, for I can jump almost anything." Miss Marshall was a little timid, but went through the ordeal successfully, amid bravos. "Marian, try your luck," said Dolly, as Preston Floyd squeezed her hand so hard it brought a flush to her cheek. "Ought she not, Cousin Preston? She's the only remaining single girl here." "Yes, she must," insisted Jaqueline. "You'll all have time to get good and ready for my wedding." Jaqueline had recovered her spirits, and caught Marian's arm, laughing gayly. "Yes. Why it's rare fun! Come, Marian. Then I'll try. I shall go the whole seven," declared Preston. Marian hung back, but they all persisted. If Mr. Greaves had been there, or her mother, but the elders had settled to whist, there being enough for two tables. Some sudden spirit roused her. She had done it times before. She would be young and gay just for five minutes. "Come." Preston was leading her out, to Jane's utter surprise. Marian had been so dignified for the last twenty-four hours; ten years older, it seemed, than last winter. And how girlish then! "Marian!" Preston laughed. "Now, Cousin Marian. The whole seven, for the honor of the house of Floyd." There were two graceful, successful leaps. Her hand trembled, half a yard of skirt dropped, and out went the third candle. There was a general cry of disappointment. "That was an accident," declared Preston. "Light the candle. Marian, you shall have another chance." "No, no, no!" She caught Jane's arm. "It was very silly," but her voice had a strained, broken sound, and she looked frightened. "Take your turn, Cousin Preston, then let them go to dancing. The fiddlers are tuning up." Jane drew her sister a little aside, while Preston Floyd won the acclaim of the crowd. "Are you happy and satisfied, Marian, or miserable?" she asked in a rapid tone, just under her breath. "You are so queer and changed." "Don't," Marian entreated. "Of course I shall marry Mr. Greaves. That was girlish foolishness, you know. And the candles really didn't mean anything. Jaqueline," as the girl had come up to her, "we were both in the same boat for awkwardness. I think I must be growing old, but you did not have so good an excuse. Do you want to stay for the dancing? Had we not better all return to the drawing room?" The younger group demurred. "Then Jane will stay and play propriety." Marian turned swiftly, and was gone before Jane could utter a word. But she paused in the hall and leaned up against the door jamb that was almost like a column. Her breath came quick and hard. "It is too late," she said breathlessly, to herself. "And he doesn't care. I have passed my word, and to break it would call down a judgment upon myself. Then--I couldn't," and she shuddered. "I am not daring like Jaqueline, or even Dolly. But Dolly thinks it best." When she entered the room her mother glanced up with sharp inquiry that softened as she motioned her to her side. "Did you get tired of the nonsense?" she asked, in an approving tone. "My hand is most played out, and you shall take my place." Mr. Greaves sat over opposite. He raised his serious, self-complacent face. She could recall another,--eager, warm with rushing emotions,--and it stood back of this one like a shadow. But, somehow, it did not beckon her. She was only a commonplace girl, rather straitly and strictly reared, with obedience impressed upon her from babyhood. Her father and mother always kept their promises, and she must do the same. The fun was fast and furious out in the great kitchen. But at ten the mistress appeared and made them a little speech. They were to go to their cabins in an orderly manner, and any disturbance would be reported. To-morrow morning they would come for their gifts, and the week would be one of holidays. "T'ankee, missus; t'ankee, missus!" came from voices still full of jollity; and woolly heads bobbed in a tumultuous manner. Christmas Day was made festive by a grand dinner, to which all the gentry round were invited. The children had theirs in a smaller room, with quite ornate serving, and afterward there were games until dark, when the visitors were sent home in the different carriages. Everybody was tired from the festivities, and the day had certainly been a success. "I suppose the lieutenant is quite crowded out of it all?" inquired Mr. Jettson of his wife. "Really, Mr. Greaves isn't so bad. But Ralston will take it mightily hard. He'd wait seven years for a woman. And Marian seems, somehow, years older, and is beginning to have some of your mother's dignity." "It is all settled, certainly. As a topic it is interdicted, and one doesn't get a chance at Marian. Mother and father are elated, only that isn't quite the word to apply to them. And there is the Floyd cousin, very much smitten with Dolly, and I suppose that will be a match. I feel as if I had lost both of the girls. I had planned to do so much for Marian, and keep her near to me." Mrs. Jettson sighed plaintively. "You poor girl! Then you will have to comfort yourself with Jaqueline." "It's queer," continued Jane retrospectively, "but Randolph's family seem nearer to me since they are growing up than my own sisters and brother. Brandon is so bitter against the administration, and such a tremendous aristocrat, while Randolph is always jolly and good-humored, if he can't quite approve of what is done. And Jaqueline is so diverting and attractive, while Mrs. Patricia is charming. If Dolly should go away----" "Preston Floyd is an agreeable young fellow. Of course the family is all right, and the money, I suppose. Your father will look out for that." "I know Marian isn't happy----" "It's a sad piece of business, but it is too late to move in it now." Jane felt this was true. Could her father have made _her_ give up her lover? Certainly he was not as arbitrary then. Or was it her salvation that no rich lover came to hand? There was another day of festivity, and a dinner to some who could not come on Christmas Day. Miss Greaves was present with the two elder children, who were stiff and proper. She did not altogether approve of the young wife, when there were more suitable women ready to take her brother. The Masons gathered up their flock and drove home immediately afterward, Mr. Jettson going with them, and the others were to follow the next day. "There wasn't much fun at grandpapa's, except on Christmas Eve," declared Varina. "Archie Floyd thinks he owns the whole world. If grandpapa should die they will come there to live, and Uncle Brandon own the slaves and everything." "Children must not discuss such matters," said her father rather peremptorily. "But Archie said----" "No matter about Archie." Varina frowned and twitched her shoulders. "Papa," said Charles after a pause, "shall you leave the plantation and everything to Louis because he is the oldest?" "My son, I warn you that I shall live a long, long while. You will all have a chance to make your own fortunes and marry and have homes of your own. So don't trouble about any such foolishness. And you are all too young to consider the point." "But people do in England." "We are not in England," commented his father dryly. "What a mess of nonsense has been talked at the Pineries!" he said to his wife with some vexation afterward. "Mr. Floyd has grown very grasping, and thinks so much of money. And that boy puts on airs enough for three grown-up fellows. Let children be children, say I, and not bother their heads about the affairs of older people. I'm sorry for Marian. Anyone can see that her heart is not in this marriage. She's changed beyond everything. But it is set for the spring. Dolly will be more like to have her own way, as the Fates have sent her an acceptable lover." Jaqueline was all in a flurry to go to Washington, and started at the first opportunity. The Carringtons had begged for a week, as some cousins were coming, and they were to give the young people a ball. "You are a sad gadabout," sighed her father. "But you keep the house astir here with your coming and going. It is time you began to learn something useful. I shall look up a nice steady-going man of forty or thereabouts, and marry you out of hand some day." "Let me see--is there anyone near here that answers the requirements?" and she laughed saucily as she put her soft arms around her father's neck. "He must have an estate, of course,--it will not do for me to fall behind-hand in family dignity,--and a long pedigree. Do you know whether the Masons, like the old Scotch woman's ancestors, had a boat of their own at the time of the flood?" "I am pretty sure there must have been Masons," he replied gravely. Mrs. Jettson received her with open arms. "Jaqueline, have you any idea of how fortunate you are? Congress is in session, and I have never known Washington so gay. And the White House is fine in its new array, while Mrs. Madison is as charming as ever. And Mrs. Van Ness is giving the most elegant entertainments. Roger Carrington was in here last evening to see if you really were coming." "Mrs. Carrington gives a ball next Tuesday evening for some young visitors. And I am invited over to Georgetown for a week. So I just coaxed to come up here a few days, for you would know about suitable gowns. I don't suppose you have heard from Marian?" "Not a word. But Arthur told Lieutenant Ralston. Really, my dear, he had half a mind to go up there and tear her out of the family bosom by main force. He couldn't believe it at first. He wrote a letter to Marian, but I am certain no one could get it to her, although he sent by a special messenger. I have given up. And Dolly's engagement is announced. Mr. Floyd spoke before he went away. I had such a complacent letter from mother. It made me angry, it really did. Well, her whole duty is done, unless she lives to marry off her granddaughters." "I suppose Dolly is really in love?" Jaqueline had not considered her very enthusiastic. She had a girl's romantic ideal of love, fostered by the attention and affection her father gave her stepmother. Had he loved her own mother in that fashion? "Dolly is a little ninny!" declared the elder sister in disdain. "They all thought she was going wild over that young Chase, but she seemed to drop him easy enough. He is going to the bad as fast as possible, though I don't believe in a woman wrecking her whole life to save a man, for, after all, she rarely does it. And I'm sorry to have Dolly go so far away. Oh, I _do_ wonder if I shall ever be glad to have baby Jaqueline marry and go out of my sight! Yet I suppose having old maids on your hands is rather mortifying. There are some new shops on Pennsylvania Avenue, with such pretty things, although there is so much talk about the difficulty of getting goods from abroad. And everybody complains of money being scarce, but there seems a good deal to spend, some way." Washington was certainly looking up. Handsome houses were being built, and famous men were to be seen in the streets and at the different entertainments. There were weekly dinner parties at the White House, managed with such tact that no one was affronted, those left out knowing their turn would come next. Jane and Mr. Jettson had an engagement that evening--"a dinner where they are going to talk improvements and the best way of getting a grant from Congress; no dancing and no nice young men to flatter a lady," declared Mr. Jettson. "Jane thinks them tiresome, but she can put in a word now and then, since it is our bread and butter." "Oh, I'd rather stay at home! There is that 'Lay of the Last Minstrel' to read. Who is this wonderful new poet? Aunt Catharine made me read 'The Course of Time' when I paid her my visit; aloud, too, so I couldn't skip much, but it was dreadfully tiresome. This goes along with a rush." So Jaqueline settled herself in the easiest chair she could find, and put her feet on the rounds of another. The candles gave a softened light; but in spite of interest she was getting drowsy when there was a hasty knock and a discussion in the hall. Then Sam opened the door and ushered in Lieutenant Ralston. "I hope you won't think me a nuisance," as Jaqueline was straightening herself up in some confusion, and feeling if the knot of abundant hair was on the top of her head or pushed over one side. "I'm sorry Mrs. Jettson is out, and I recall the fact now that she had an engagement. But I am very glad to see you, selfishly glad. Do I interrupt anything important?" "Oh, no!" She held out her hand cordially. "You were up to the Pineries," he began abruptly. "Did Marian seem----" "We didn't think her real happy." Jaqueline hesitated. How much ought she to admit? "I wrote her a letter. I wanted to know the truth. You see, I have been perfectly honorable. I told her I would wait seven years or twice seven years, and she promised to do the same. I couldn't believe she accepted this man of her own free will. And then I wrote, taking precautions to have it reach her. It has been opened and returned to me without a word. Here it is. That is not Miss Floyd's handwriting." "It is grandpapa's." "Do you suppose she gave the letter to him?" "I am afraid she must have. You see, the engagement has been announced everywhere, and they sit together in church. The neighbors give little companies for them, and Mr. Greaves acts as if he had full right to her." Ralston dashed the letter to the floor. "Then she is weak and false!" he cried in a passion. "I could wait with very little encouragement, so long as it _was_ waiting. We are both young, and I have my fortune to make. But when she engages herself to another, when--Mrs. Jettson said there was talk of a marriage in the spring! Even if she had written to explain--I think I could have stood being given up by her if she had said it was a mistake, and she had found she was over-hasty. It was sudden--done in those two days; but then I had seen her frequently during her visit to Mrs. Jettson, and I was sure she cared for me. She had a kind of shy way--looking back and forth; do you remember it? But perhaps the glances are only meant for a lover's eyes," smiling faintly in spite of the anger. "Either she loved me or she was a coquette." "She is not a coquette!" exclaimed Jaqueline decisively. "And she never had a real lover until----" Then the girl stopped and flushed. "What I can't understand is her accepting this man if she loved me, taking his caresses and his plans for a life together----" "Oh, he isn't the caressing sort!" interrupted Jaqueline. "And yet I don't see how she could, if she loved you. I wouldn't have been forced to accept him. I wouldn't have promised anybody. I would just have waited. But Grandfather Floyd is very arbitrary, and when he makes up his mind, there is no relenting. Oh, I am afraid you can't understand! You don't know him." "The time is past when a woman is compelled to marry a man she doesn't want," he said with an angry sneer. "I know the old adage says that a continual dropping will wear away a stone. But this has been such a little while. There may be shaly natures that the dropping disintegrates rapidly. And you girls never talked with her about it, which seems strange to me." "We scarcely saw her alone. And we were strictly forbidden to speak of it." "Then he must have felt afraid of your influence." Ralston looked eagerly at the girl, as if he was searching for some ground of hope. "It can't be changed any way, I think. Marian has accepted it, and the whole neighborhood has congratulated her. The wedding has been put down as a certainty." "If I pity her I shall keep on loving her and thinking something _may_ happen. And if I believe her weak and false I shall despise her and get over it. One couldn't respect such a weak woman!" Jaqueline wanted to make a protest. It was very hard to be despised, and she thought Marian hardly deserved that. "I suppose this wouldn't have happened if I had been the rich man," and there were lines of scorn about his mouth. Jaqueline knew it wouldn't. Did not money measure most of the things in this life? And Lieutenant Ralston was young, energetic, very good-looking, and delightful; Mr. Greaves was thin, with a large nose, and high, narrow forehead, his hair sprinkled with gray at the temples. He was gentlemanly, but rather pompous; and there was nothing entertaining about him, unless it was to old Mr. Floyd. Marian had always seemed so young. "If I knew who returned that letter! If I knew _she_ had seen it!" He was walking back and forth, and just touched it with the toe of his boot. It would have a curious sacredness if it had been in her hands; her father's hands and eyes made it a thing to be despised. Had he sneered over it? "I am quite sure she never saw it," returned Jaqueline decisively. He picked it up and threw it into the fire. "You see," he began apologetically, "that I have come to you and Mrs. Jettson because you were near to her and knew her best. I dare say I have made myself quite ridiculous, prating of love----" "Oh, no, not that!" she interrupted quickly. "And I am so sorry it has come out this way. I was so interested in it all, and even papa liked you so much." That was comforting. He would be proud of the esteem of such a man as Randolph Mason. Other men had failed to win their first loves. Even Mr. Madison, as the story went, had been positively engaged to a charming young woman who had changed her mind and married another. And where would one find a more devoted couple than the President and his wife, who had had her youthful love and misfortunes and sorrows? "When a man resolves to put a thing out of his mind he can do it if he has any force of character." Ralston held his head up very erect now, though he still kept pacing the floor. "That would be best," advised Jaqueline. "Oh, yes; there is no use going about the world crying for the moon, when the sun shines as much again, and there is a good deal to do. So I shall not be a lovelorn swain, but go on with an earnest effort, for I have some ambitions, and though the times may seem tame by contrast with the stirring events of our fathers', there are still grave questions to study. It is not all froth and amusement. I hope you are going to remain a while. You're like a sister to Mrs. Jettson." "I am invited to Georgetown for a week. And I think I shall stay quite a while. It's so delightful here, and rather dull at home. I do miss Patricia very much." "And there is a ball at the Carringtons'. I am glad you are to be there. Roger and I are fast friends. And now have I not bored you enough? I will try to make amends in the future. Will you tell Mrs. Jettson the result of my letter? She warned me. Your father warned me; but I suppose willful youth will have its own way. Good-night. Let me see--there is a levee to-morrow evening, and you have not seen the new plenishings yet. We are very grand in yellow satin and damask. If Mrs. Jettson is not engaged you must go." "Poor Marian!" Jaqueline sighed, in relating the interview to Jane and contrasting the lovers. "I don't believe grandpapa could compel me, and she is so much older, too. And when she sees Dolly's delight and happiness!" "I have given her up," confessed Mrs. Jettson. "She may be comfortable, and perhaps happier than at home. Oh, Jaqueline, be thankful that your father doesn't belong to the Floyd branch! For Brandon will be his father right over again. There must be a sort of Puritan strand in them. When you find me so stiff and strenuous you had better banish me at once." Jaqueline met some people at the levee who remembered her, which was quite flattering to the young girl. She hardly knew which of her cavaliers she admired most, the fine-looking lieutenant or Mr. Carrington. Both were made much of by the ladies, and cordially recognized by the men of the period who were to be the heroes of succeeding generations. The ball was quite delightful. Though it was given for the young people, there were mothers and aunts, and not a few fathers who dropped in later in the evening. Young people were not left to themselves, and the elders enjoyed seeing the pretty triumphs of their daughters and telling little anecdotes of their own youth and their conquests. It was true that Lieutenant Ralston did not wear the willow outwardly. Yet as time went on and his love for Marian having nothing to feed upon chilled the warm exultation of hope, he grew a trifle bitter at heart, and indulged in some cynical reflections that had stings of wit. Indeed, wit and repartee were largely cultivated then. There were few books to talk about, except among the learned men, who still affected classic lore. And it was not considered a womanly accomplishment for the fair sex to be versed in politics. It seems strange to us now that there should have been so much talk in letters and journals about finery and fashion, and who was paying his addresses to this or that young damsel, and the furnishing of someone's new house. Perhaps the women of that time were more discreet. For Mrs. Madison must have been close in her husband's confidence all those trying years, and known how to leave a good deal unsaid. But general society then was for the entertainment of all, and each one was expected to do his or her share. Good-breeding was a virtue. Jaqueline was gay enough. Virginian girls had a charm and attractiveness besides mere beauty of feature. So week by week her return home was put off, until a visit from Dolly Floyd was announced. Mr. Floyd was quite ailing, and his wife could not leave him. Mrs. Mason was asked to consult with Mrs. Jettson and see what was proper, and have the wedding trousseau prepared, since Dolly was to go away, and there was hardly time to send abroad. Mr. Floyd had insisted upon a wedding just after Easter, as he was to go to New York to attend to some business for his father, and he would be delighted to have Dolly bear him company. "But Marian?" exclaimed Mrs. Mason, when Dolly had unfolded her budget. "Marian insists that she won't be married until June. And mother has given her that beautiful pearl-satin gown in which she was married to papa, and after that she grew so stout she could never wear it. But mother prefers that she shall be married in white. Marian has grown to be quite an old woman already; you can't think how queer she is!" Mrs. Mason's heart went out with sympathy to her young sister-in-law, who was trying in such a rigid fashion to fit herself for her new life. Mrs. Jettson felt rather hurt at first that the matter was not delegated wholly to her, since the shopping and the work must be done in Washington. "But, you see, I am to get some things in New York afterward, and Mrs. Marshall brought over some patterns that her sister sent from Paris, and she is to send us her mantua-maker. You know she had Sarah trained, when they were over, to make frocks and caps and mantles. She is to sew for Marian." "And is Marian as happy as you?" asked Mrs. Jettson, studying the young girl. Dolly shrugged her shoulders. She was a flippant little thing, occupied mostly with herself. Her own pleasure came first. "I don't see how she can be, with that stick of a lover. I'm sure you can't compare him with Preston. But if he suits her--and she's trying to take an interest in the children. I think they're hideous. Oh, Jane, it is a great shame the lieutenant hadn't been better off! He's such a delightful fellow. There was a dreadful time about him. But, good gracious! I was not to say a word," and Dolly turned pale. "Do you know whether Marian had a letter from him soon after the holidays?" "Did he write? Why, that was romantic! No--I do not believe it reached her. And if it had, it couldn't have altered anything. Mr. Greaves is very much in earnest, and Marian will have one of the finest houses in the county. Then he talks of going to England and leaving the two older children for their education. Some cousin or uncle or relative died a while ago; and if someone else should die he would come in for a title and a fine estate. Father is quite elated over that. Father should have been born an English aristocrat," and Dolly laughed. "But if I wasn't so in love with Preston I might be captured by the young soldier or some of the beaus with which Washington abounds. Oh, dear! if we could have come to the inauguration! I'm glad to go away, for it's wretchedly dull all about the Pineries. And Charleston is quite gay, Preston writes." The shopping was done, and the gowns and coats and pelisses left at Mrs. Sweeny's, who was quite celebrated for her taste. Then Dolly was suddenly summoned home. Her father had a poorly spell, and Mr. Greaves had met with an accident. As he was going to mount his horse one morning to ride over to the Pineries, an owl that had been nesting in a tree near the house made a flight across the lawn, at which the horse shied and knocked down his master, whose head struck the stepping-stone, and he had lain unconscious ever since, but no bones were broken. They had a hope that it would not prove serious, since Mr. Greaves had an excellent constitution and had never been ill a day in his life. CHAPTER XI. THE THORNS THAT BESET LOVE. The spring was late this year, but when it came everything burst into bloom and beauty as if by magic. Even the marshy ends of the streets in Washington were covered with verdure and the curious delicate bloom of the different sedge growths. Congress kept on. There were many perplexing questions, and war loomed in the distance. The festivities at the Pineries were quite interrupted. When Mr. Greaves recovered consciousness it was found that his right side had been partially paralyzed. His speech was affected, and the doctor spoke doubtfully of his mind. Consequently all thoughts of Marian's marriage must be given up for the present. But Dolly's went on, and the last week in April the impatient lover presented himself, and the family relatives and friends were gathered to celebrate the occasion. It was considered most proper for Louis Mason to attend Marian, who was to be the first bridesmaid. Jaqueline was next in order, and there were three others. Weddings were quite sumptuous affairs in those days. There was a great supper and dancing; one of the bride-cakes held a ring, put in by the hand of the bride-elect, and great was the interest to see who would get it. This fell to Jaqueline. And when the bride was escorted upstairs by her bevy of maidens she paused on the landing and scattered her half-dozen roses which had been sent from Washington, and cost extravagantly. The first one did not go far, and caught in Jaqueline's shoulder-knot. There was a general laughing exclamation. "And I haven't even a lover!" cried the girl with dainty mock regret. There was a grand breakfast the next morning--a real breakfast, not a noon luncheon. Many of the guests had remained all night. Mirth and jollity reigned, good-wishes were given, healths were drunk, and at noon the young couple started on their long stage-coach journey. Tours were hardly considered then, though the bride often journeyed to the house of her husband's nearest relatives. But to take in Baltimore and Philadelphia was enough to set one up for life, and Dolly was very much elated. The return trip would be made by water, so she would be quite a traveled bride. Marian had been the sedate elder sister. She was not old, but she had grown much older and lost the aspect of girlhood that she had kept her three-and-twenty years. There was much kindly sympathy expressed for her. Mr. Greaves grew more helpless instead of improving, and his mind had never been quite clear. But no one suggested an interrupted engagement except among the slaves, who recalled that she had put out her candle on Christmas Eve, and the ring in the cake had not come to her, nor a single rose. "Looks laik she cut out fer 'n ole maid," declared a gray-haired mammy. "En she mought 'a' bin a gret lady, goin' ober to de ole country. But young missy goin' to be happy as de day is long. De house'll never seem de same." "Grandfather Floyd has begun to break," said Mr. Mason when they had started on their homeward journey. "One can hardly decide whether to be glad or sorry about Marian. Anyway, it is hard on the poor girl." "And you can't decide whether she is sorry or not. I never saw anyone change so. She has grown curiously close about herself," declared Jaqueline. The interrupted intimacy between the two families was taken up again. Even Jane and her three children were invited to the Pineries for a hot month in the summer. Grandfather was quite deaf, which made him more irritable, and Marian played piquet with him for hours together. Mrs. Floyd managed the plantation, though she had always taken her share of that. Patricia came home a slim, pretty, and piquant young woman, refined and finished, and Louis was an attractive young collegian. The house was filled with guests, and there was much merriment, until one day the word came that surprised them all. Grandfather had been found dead in his chair on the porch where he took his usual afternoon nap. Family funerals were almost as grand occasions as marriages at this period. The great house was filled with guests, and there was no unseemly haste to bury the dead out of their sight. The funeral procession might have been that of a famous man. When they returned the relatives were gathered in the darkened parlor where the candles stood lighted on a table, and Archibald Floyd's will was read in a dry, decorous tone by the little old lawyer who had made wills for half a century. As was expected, the Pineries and slaves and appurtenances of all kinds went to Brandon, who was the only son. The girls had an equal money portion. The widow was provided with a home; certain rooms were set apart for her, certain slaves were bequeathed to her with the bed and table linen and some of the furnishings that she had brought with her; and Brandon was to pay her a regular income out of the estate, which was to cease at her death. A very fair and just will, it was agreed on every side. Meanwhile there had been no perceptible change in Mr. Greaves. He did not suffer much; he was fed and cared for like a child. Some days he brightened and talked with encouraging coherence, but it was mostly about his early life, and he now and then mistook his sister for his dead wife. And though Marian had gone over several times, he had not seemed to recall her specially. Miss Greaves was in her element. She had not taken kindly to the prospect of being deposed, though the training of women in her day led them to accept the inevitable without complaining. She was rather proud, too, that her brother had won a young woman; and Marian's sudden gravity after her engagement had given her considerable satisfaction. "The doctor holds out very little hope of perfect recovery," she said to the younger woman at one call. "He thinks brother's mind will never be quite right again. He has a good appetite now and sleeps well, but it is very sad to be stricken down in the very prime of life. On our mother's side we are a long-lived race. I had an aunt who lay paralyzed for seven years, and was eighty when she died." Marian shuddered. Her father's failing health had demanded most of her attention. Was she in any way relieved? She tried not to think of it. No one referred to the marriage, except now and then some of the slaves, who counted up all the bad signs in an awesome fashion. Dolly had enjoyed everything to the uttermost, and was delighted with her new home and her new relatives. Communication between even the most important cities was tardy at that time, and often sent by private messenger. Yet the political interest of the States was kept up keenly, almost to rivalry. New England, whose commerce had been injured the most, complained loudly. The States were between two fires. England was bringing all her power to bear upon the Emperor Napoleon. Neither country paid any attention to the rights of neutrals. There was the old romantic remembrance of France coming to our assistance in our mighty struggle with the mother country; but there were a hundred relationships with England where there was one with France, and Napoleon's ruthlessness had alienated the noblest sense of the community. Yet living went on in the lavish, cordial Virginian fashion at the old plantation, if it was not quite so full of gayety. There were two attractive young women now, and the young men were haunting the house, planning riding parties and a day's outing to some grove or wood, a sail down or up the Potomac, and a three-days' visit to some neighbor who rather regretfully gave up dancing on account of the recent death. Louis had been putting in law with his other studies, and was not to graduate for another year. Roger Carrington was now a steady visitor, and all the household knew he was young missy's lover. Her father's assent had been cordially given. Her own was still in abeyance. Jaqueline had a willful streak in her nature. If someone had opposed, she would have sided at once with her lover. But everybody agreed. Mrs. Carrington treated her as a daughter already, and longed to have the engagement announced. Roger pleaded. "I want to be quite sure that I love you better than anybody," she would say with a kind of dainty sweetness. "If one _should_ make a mistake!" "But we are such friends already. We have been for a long time. Surely if you disliked me you would have found it out before this." "But I don't dislike you. I like you very much. Only it seems that things which come so easy----" She let her lovely eyes droop, and the color came and went in her face. How exquisite her rose-leaf cheeks were! He wished he had the right to kiss them fifty times an hour. A husband would have. But there was a fine courtesy between lovers of that day. And there was always some curling tendril of shadowy hair clustering about her fair temples. Her ear, too, was like a bit of sculpture, and the lines that went down her neck and lost themselves in the roundness of her shoulders changed with every motion, each one prettier than the last, and were distractingly tempting. "I'm sure it doesn't come easy to me," he said in a rather curt tone. "Oh, doesn't it? I thought there really was no mistaking the grand passion on a man's part--that he was convinced in the flash of an eye." "It is when he wishes to convince that his doubt arises. If I could persuade you----" longingly. "I am always afraid I shall be too easily persuaded," she returned plaintively. "I sometimes wonder if I really have a good strong mind of my own. Do you know, I should like to be one of the heroic women; then in case war should come--there are such talks about it, you know--and I _had_ to send you away----" She looked so utterly bewitching that he had much ado not to clasp her to his heart. "You are heroic enough. And you are tormenting to the last degree. I wonder sometimes if you even like me!" "Oh, you know I like you," carelessly. "If you would once say 'I love you.' You like so many people--young men, I mean." "Why, when you have been brought up with them, so to speak----" and she looked up out of large, innocent eyes. "There are the Bakers, you know. Georgie, Rob, Teddy, and I have played together always. Would you have me turn haughty now?" "I don't mind the Bakers, and Teddy is as good as engaged to Hester Fairfax, who really does adore him." "Yes, I think she does," gravely. "He is always describing her perfections and her sweetnesses, as if we hadn't quarreled and declared we wouldn't speak to each other and done little spiteful tricks that girls always do, and--and gotten over it, and know all about each other." "I don't believe you were ever very spiteful. That takes a small nature." She looked furtively from under her long lashes, as if considering. "Well--Patty and I quarrel. You must know that I haven't the most amiable temper in the world when I am roused." "Yes." She could be very tormenting. "And I like to have my own way. Papa generally gives in. And sometimes I feel self-condemned that mamma is so good to me." "Then you have a conscience?" "I don't believe my own mother would have been so easy. And there's grandmamma----" "Who would have led you to find out your mind in short order," he commented quickly. "_Her_ mind, you mean. And if she had resolved that I shouldn't marry you, you would have been sent to the right-about at once. And that reminds me--Lieutenant Ralston is coming down next week. But I suppose you are not afraid of him, since his heart is--oh, can you tell where it is? Sometimes I think he still cares for Marian, and then he is so bitter and sharp. She won't ever marry Mr. Greaves now." She looked so eager and earnest, as if this was the main question of her life. He turned away with a pang at his heart. Was she anything but a volatile, teasing girl, with no deep feelings? "You shan't! I say you shan't! Annis belongs to me. You shan't take her away. We're going to row round the pond----" Louis laughed with a soft sound of triumph. "But you promised to ride with me, didn't you, Annis? And I don't see how Annis belongs to you especially. You're too old for that boyish foolishness. Why, you couldn't marry her in years and years, and then she'd be an old woman, queer and cross. Hillo!" in a surprised tone. They faced Mr. Carrington and Jaqueline. "Oh, Louis, why do you tease the children so?" exclaimed Jaqueline in disapprobation. "I'm not teasing you, Annis, am I? We were to go for a ride, and her pony is all ready, when Charles flew into a passion." "I told you Scipio was getting the boat ready----" "But I didn't think you meant to-day. Was Polly making fun of her? Julia’s more serious tones reassured her. “Yes, tell us, Jane. Ruth and I had the special honor the other evening of pouring chocolate at Professor Judson’s; his wife is some kind of a cousin of Uncle Robert’s. But why weren’t you there? You belong to the Philosophical Club.” “Yes,” added Polly. “You _would_ have enjoyed meeting some of your fellow sufferers from Harvard; there were several sedate youths among them, Jane, exactly your style. The paper was most improving; every social gathering in Cambridge has to be opened with a paper. Why weren’t you there?” “Clothes,” replied Jane laconically, smoothing the folds of her black student gown. “Oh, I suppose that you do not care to go where you cannot wear that becoming cap and gown. “Oh, Jane! oh, Jane! oh, Jane! oh, Jane! Never did I think that you were so vain.” Jane’s discomfort increased under Polly’s fusillade. “I might be more comfortable in my cap and gown,” she retorted, “but they would be as unsuitable as my brown merino in some places, and that is the only best gown that I own.” “I’m sure that it’s, it’s—” “No,” said Jane gravely, as Julia stumbled; “no, it is neither beautiful nor becoming. But it has been very useful to me this winter. I wear it at our college functions with few qualms. It is only when I am invited outside that I am disinclined to wear it.” “Isn’t that rather foolish? In these days woman can be perfectly independent about her clothes.” And Clarissa gave her curly head the toss of independent “Young America.” “No one can live entirely to herself, even in the matter of clothes,” Jane explained. “If a hostess goes to the trouble and expense of providing a pleasant evening for her friends, her guests should wear festival attire. You are ‘asserting a false mood.’ Isn’t that what Shaftesbury would say?” And she turned to Polly, who of all present alone happened to be in her Philosophy class. “Yes,” said Clarissa, “I agree with you there. I never could understand why people in the East wear ugly clothes at times when they ought to be in their best bib and tucker. When I am invited anywhere—which isn’t often—I always try to wear something bright and cheerful.” “The poster girl!” murmured Polly under her breath. “I’d rather be called a poster girl than a mummy,” said Clarissa, “though you, Jane, in your brown merino would be more welcome at some functions than others I could name in purple and fine linen.” “And I will wear my brown dress and never look too fine,” hummed Polly. “You remember that Jennie Wren married Cock Robin, who seems to have been a fairy prince among the birds. Every one knows that you are sure of a _summa cum_, Jane Townall, so that you ought to be able to wear what you like at any time.” “I can’t speak for Jane,” interposed Julia, “but I am sure that in accepting invitations we ought to think of what the hostess would like. Don’t frown, Clarissa.” “Oh, of course you are more in society than we are.” “Nonsense, that isn’t fair,” replied Julia. “But college girls ought to place themselves above the criticisms of those who do not look below the surface.” “One shouldn’t think too much of appearances. Who cares for narrow-minded people? We must take the world as we find it.” “I suppose so,” sighed Clarissa. “If I had worn a conventional Boston costume, perhaps Mrs. Blair would not have gazed at me the other day as if I were some newly discovered species. Next year I’ll appear out in—” “Excuse me for interrupting,” cried Polly, “but let us do the proper thing by putting the matter to the vote.” “Resolved, that no Radcliffe student shall accept an invitation to a festivity in Cambridge, or the adjoining suburb Boston, unless arrayed in a becoming light gown.” “Low-necked?” questioned Clarissa. “Cream-white?” asked Jane with unwonted levity. “Color and style to suit the complexion of the wearer,” replied Polly. “Only no more dingy street gowns and hats at evening receptions.” Though there wasn’t a dissenting voice, all knew that they were in earnest to only a limited extent. Yet the discussion showed that dress was a subject demanding some attention from even the busiest college girl. It could not be dismissed with a word. “If a hostess fears that I shall mortify her she needn’t invite me.” A busy girl naturally cannot give much time to shopping and dressmakers. Often she has little money to give to either. Yet by exercising care and taste, the girl with a small purse can often work wonders. The world of college undergraduates long since decided that there is no real connection between genius and dowdy dress, and that the wearer of a well-fitting gown need not lack mental ability. There was some point to this discussion because invitations to affairs outside of the immediate college now came occasionally to even the quietest of the Freshmen. One or two of their professors invited them to receptions. Some of the girls living at home in Cambridge or Boston entertained more or less. In addition there were various college affairs to which the outside world was invited, and those students who acted as hostesses or ushers were especially conspicuous. Simplicity was the keynote of most of the entertainments offered outside of Radcliffe, as well as in the college itself. This was disappointing sometimes to the occasional girl, conscious of her father’s wealth, who had come to Cambridge expecting this wealth to count for as much in her college life as it had counted at her own home. Yet no girl at Radcliffe was ever so dull as not to discover speedily that plain living really set the standard in Cambridge, and that any departure from simplicity was really regarded as blamable rather than praiseworthy. XI EFFORTS TO HELP Julia, one spring afternoon, waiting in Edith’s library for Edith to return from down town, was in the midst of a conversation with Philip. His woe-begone face might have made her laugh had she not fortunately realized that one cannot long retain her influence over the person she has laughed at. “If she hadn’t written me herself,” Philip was saying, “I couldn’t have believed it. It seems he’s a member of Parliament, too. Well, I may be something myself sometime. She might have waited. I can’t fix my mind on anything now, and I fancy mother and Edith will be disappointed when I can’t get my degree.” “What have they to do with it?” cried Julia. “I’m sure that they have always encouraged you.” “Why, if they hadn’t disapproved of Adelaide Cain, she might not have been so heartless, and then I should be in better spirits now.” “You can’t imagine,” said Julia, “that Adelaide Cain threw you over just because your mother disapproved of her? She hasn’t the reputation of being so conscientious.” “How hard girls are to one another!” exclaimed Philip in his most cynical tone. “Nonsense! nonsense!” and Julia laughed. “I’m positive that in three months you will rejoice that Miss Cain preferred some one else. But did you mean what you just said about your degree?” “Well, my degree is certainly awfully shaky. There was a scrape I was in in my Freshman year. They kept me on probation, and they do not seem to think that I have lived it down. Then I have two exams. to make up, one I lost when I was sick and another I failed on, and some of my work this year is a little uncertain. I’ve a good mind to cut it all now and quit.” “What! leave everything, without taking your degree? No, indeed, Philip, you mustn’t do it!” “Well, I’ve only a few weeks, and—and—well, I suppose that I might as well make a full confession. I have a lot of debt hanging over me, and I cannot tell my father.” “Oh, Philip!” Julia threw a great deal of feeling into her tone. This last trouble seemed much more serious than either of the other things of which Philip had spoken. She felt that it was to his advantage that Miss Cain had set him aside, and she knew that if he applied himself he could make up his deficiencies in his studies. But a matter of money—she hardly knew how to advise him. “It’s three thousand dollars.” “Three thousand dollars! An enormous sum for an undergraduate to owe.” Although Philip had lately come of age, Julia knew that he had no money of his own. She knew, too, that although Mr. Blair was liberal to his children he had a strong dislike for debt. She wondered if he would come forward and pay this for Philip. “It’s an old debt,” said Philip. “It was made last year. Part of it is money I really owe, but the greater part is on notes I endorsed for Farlong.” Julia had heard of Farlong. He was a law student from a distance, who had made a great display for a year or two. Then the failure of his father—a rather notorious stockbroker—had brought his college career to a close. “Yes,” continued Philip, “I was so foolish as to let Farlong invest a little money for me. Of course I lost it, and more, too, than I put in. Then Farlong lent me some money, and when the crash came I was considerably in his debt. I’ve been able to renew the notes, but now they have to be paid, and with interest the whole sum is three thousand dollars. So you can see that I have enough on my mind just at present.” As he talked Julia realized that she could not help him. “The very best thing,” she said, “is for you to go at once to your father. It’s a large sum, but for a year or two you can economize, and it will be worth a great deal to get this load off your mind.” “I don’t know,” and Philip sighed heavily, at the same time closing with a snap the watch-case in which he carried the picture of Adelaide Cain. Except for the danger of offending Philip, Julia would have liked to laugh at his feeling for Adelaide Cain. Adelaide was a distant cousin of his, several years his senior, who had been engaged several times. She was fond of attention; and as her latest engagement had been broken off the past summer, she had let Philip dance attendance upon her while she was travelling with Mrs. Blair’s party in Europe. Philip had imagined that she really cared for him, and had written her many letters after his return. At last Miss Cain had announced her engagement to another. Philip felt greatly aggrieved by this news. His self-love had been injured. Yet, if he had been willing to admit it, his present discomfort was caused by his money loss rather than by the loss of the friendship of Adelaide Cain. But it relieved his feelings a little to complain of the unkindness of this fickle young lady. “Now make a clean breast of it to your father,” cried Julia in parting. But Philip merely shrugged his shoulders. June came in as a hot month, making harder the final examinations of the year. There was hardly a Radcliffe girl who did not go about with a wilted air, as if life had lost all its charm. The cool corners of Fay House were occupied by students, and the beauty of the tree-shaded streets and the flower-laden gardens was wasted on them. Julia, Ruth, and even the discreet Pamela herself were no better than their fellows in this matter of examinations. Pamela, indeed, was especially nervous in her dread of falling below “A” in something. With the hope of a scholarship before her, she felt that she could afford nothing less than perfection. Julia and Ruth, coaching each other in Latin and English, studied throughout long, fragrant evenings, when they would infinitely have preferred sitting idly on Mrs. Colton’s little piazza. On her way from town one day as she stepped on the open car, Julia saw Philip upon the running-board. He carried his dress-suit case, and in a hurried glance Julia saw that he looked worn and tired. “Why, what is it?” she asked, as he took a seat beside her. “What is what?” “Why, you have a very melancholy air.” “I thought I told you that I had several things to worry me.” “And I advised you to tell your father.” “Well, I’ve told him. I’m going in town to tell him something else now, and also to bid my mother and Edith good-bye. They sail for Europe to-morrow.” “To sail to-morrow? Why, how strange! They will miss your Class Day.” “_My_ Class Day!” Philip laughed sharply. “_My_ Class Day! Why, I haven’t any Class Day. I haven’t any Class, for that matter.” Julia was almost overcome by what he had said. In the first place, she found it almost impossible to realize that Edith was starting for Europe without letting her know her plans—without bidding her good-bye. At least at the first moment it had been very hard to understand this; if Philip’s second statement should prove true, that he was to have no Class Day, it threw some light on Edith’s departure. The car thundered over Harvard Bridge; a fresh breeze blew from the river, and life seemed a little better worth living than it had a half-hour before. Julia looked down the river toward the city. Her eyes fixed themselves on the tower of the old gaol, and on the streets that ran up the hill, until at last they rested on the golden dome of the State House. The golden dome seemed to burn itself into her brain, and whenever again she thought of this interview with Philip it seemed to dance before her eyes. “What do you mean, Philip, about your Class Day?” “Why, just what I said. I’m going to throw it all up. I told you that if I couldn’t straighten things out I wouldn’t stay. Well, I’ve slipped up entirely on one of my examinations, and that has settled the question of my degree. My father is beside himself, he is so disappointed. He’s making a great fuss about that money, too. I suppose that he’ll pay it, but I’m pretty sure that he wouldn’t pay any Class Day bills, too. So that even if I could stay for my degree, I couldn’t have much fun Class Day. I’m going to cut it all.” “What do you mean?” “Why, I’m going to cut it all—Cambridge, College, everything.” “But the Law School—you are coming back to the Law School?” “No, indeed, I’ve had enough of study.” Had Philip looked closely at Julia he might have noticed an involuntary smile. It did not seem to Julia as if in the past few months Philip had been overworked. “Yes,” he continued, “I’m going on a ranch, or something of that kind. Jim Devereux is out in Dakota, and he has always been asking me to come out. I’ll go for the summer and see what chance there is for a fellow out there.” “But I can’t help thinking how disappointed your mother and Edith will be. I know that Edith has set her heart on your Class Day. Why, her dress is all ready. She wrote me about it the other day.” “Well, she could wear it just the same if she weren’t going away. There are others in the Class, and she has had invitations. But my mother won’t stay. They’re going straight to London. Anyway, Edith isn’t really out yet, and next year will be time enough for her Class Day.” Philip’s tone made Julia think of the boy who whistled to keep his courage up. They were near the Square. “I hope I’ll see you soon,” she said, as Philip began to gather up his belongings preparatory to leaving the car. Philip paused for a moment, bending down to shake hands with her before jumping off. “I am not quite sure,” he said hesitatingly. “I should like to have a talk with you, but I am really going away at once.” Before she could ask him when, he had swung himself down and was hastening toward the Yard. He had murmured an explanation about an engagement, and Julia had taken this as an apology for his leaving her so abruptly. As she recalled the interview word by word, she wished that she might have had a good talk with Edith. The next day was so hot that Julia went down to Rockley for Sunday, and there, naturally enough, she found them all talking of Philip’s failure to get his degree. “It all comes,” said Mr. Barlow, “from letting a boy have his own way in everything. I suppose that Philip has never had an ungratified wish. When his father was in college students had to study. I know how it was, for we were in the same class. But now—why, study is merely incidental. They elect this or they elect that, and it is all a matter of whim.” “So students were altogether perfect in your day, Uncle Robert,” said Julia a little mischievously. “Then it wasn’t you who told me of a whole class that was at least half expelled?” “Rusticated, my dear, or suspended; not expelled,” responded Mr. Barlow with a smile. “Oh, I dare say that we were not exactly perfect, but then, you know boys will be boys.” “Yes, but as I understand it, Philip hasn’t even been rusticated, and still less expelled. It’s only that he can’t get his degree this year.” “Well, well,” said Mr. Barlow, “it seems to me that that is bad enough.” “Oh,” interposed Brenda, “I shouldn’t wonder if he’d get it next year. Philip always could get anything he wanted if he’d take the trouble.” “It’s a pity that he hadn’t taken the trouble this year. Really, I sympathize with his father. He has spent much money on Philip, and here he sees him leave Cambridge with a kind of stigma, for that is what it amounts to. I doubt that that ever happened to a Blair before. They may never have been brilliant, but they’ve always had a respectable standing in college. I don’t wonder that Mr. Blair is annoyed.” “But Edith,” cried Brenda, “just think of Edith! She told me when she came home last autumn that she was very tired of Europe, and here she is dragged off again at a few days’ notice, and she wanted so much to have a jolly Class Day. Even if Philip isn’t there she might manage to have a good time. She has as many invitations as I have, and there are Tom Hearst and Will Hardon and all the others whom she knows so well.” “Remember, Brenda,” cried Mrs. Barlow warningly, “that you are going this year only by special favor. You are a year younger than you ought to be on your first Class Day.” “I know it, I know it, mamma, but I shall enjoy it just as well as if I were a year older. Besides, I shall go next year, too,” and Brenda pirouetted several times around the piazza. Later in the evening, as Julia sat on the piazza looking out at sea, at the lamps revolving in the distant lighthouse and the moon rising from the water, her thoughts still lingered with Philip. The moon, at first a large crimson disk near the horizon, had been transformed into a smaller golden sphere nearer the zenith, and still Julia sat there wondering if Philip had left Cambridge, wondering if he would become a ranchman, wondering if he would think it worth while ever to come back for his degree. Fay House, when Julia returned to it, had begun to take on its summer expression. The finals were over, and the entrance examinations had not begun. Very few girls were visible in the house, although there was a double set on the tennis ground and a group watching the game. But within there was an almost deathly stillness. The conversation room no longer re-echoed to undergraduate quips and jokes, and the little brass figures, appliquéed to the black wooden pillars of the mantle-piece as Polly had described them, gazed on deserted chairs. The magazines and periodicals were strewn untidily on the tables. Into this room Julia wandered this Monday afternoon. She fingered some of the magazines idly and then she turned toward the window. As she did so she gave a start, for there in a chair with her handkerchief over her face was a girl. Evidently she was asleep, for she did not stir as Julia drew near. The sight of the Vermont girl there—for it was Pamela—seemed to Julia like an echo of something that had happened. She remembered that it was in this very corner of this very room she had found Pamela looking so forlorn on the day of the first Idler reception. As she gazed at her now, Julia realized that in her absorption of the past few weeks, with a kind of unintentional selfishness, she had really hardly seen Pamela. Indeed, she had scarcely thought of her. Julia’s approach wakened Pamela, and as she pulled the handkerchief from her face, Julia noticed that she looked worn and thinner than usual. “How cool you look!” Pamela exclaimed, as Julia took her hand. Pamela herself wore a stiffly starched shirt waist of rather clumsy cut, a high linen collar, and a heavy woollen skirt. Julia, in an écru muslin finished with a ruffle at the wrist and a soft ribbon at the neck, appeared in contrast the picture of comfort. “What are you going to do this summer, Pamela?” asked Julia suddenly. She wondered if Pamela might not be worrying about the future. As the latter seemed to hesitate over her reply, she added, “Why couldn’t you come home with me to dinner, and then ride somewhere with me on the electric cars, to Newton, or to Arlington, if that would suit you better?” “Oh, I wish that I could!” cried Pamela. “But you know I am busy still at Miss Batson’s. Couldn’t you call for me after tea?” “Yes, indeed. Will seven o’clock be too early?” “Oh, I can be ready then, easily.” Julia was prompt at the appointed hour, and before Pamela could interpose she was warmly greeted by Miss Batson and introduced to three of the boarders who were seated on the steps. As they reached the car, Julia, with her arm in Pamela’s, said rather brusquely, “You haven’t failed in your finals, have you?” “Why, no! But why do you ask?” Pamela’s tone was one of extreme surprise. “Oh, I wished to startle you into telling me what troubles you.” “Perhaps I am foolish,” responded Pamela, “but I’ve been wondering whether it’s really worth while to go on. Perhaps I oughtn’t to come back next year.” “I suppose you haven’t had a mark below ‘B.’” “I’ve had only one ‘B.’” “And everything else was an ‘A’?” “Yes,” she replied, “but I am afraid that you think me very conceited to tell you.” “Not when I asked you. Well, if the trouble isn’t marks, it must be money. I should think that you might tell me just _what_ it is. You do not look as well as you did when you entered, and you were not exactly robust then.” “I suppose it’s partly the hot weather,” responded Pamela, sighing. “Then, besides, I’m pretty tired of Miss Batson and her household. I’m glad that she is going to close her house this summer. Otherwise I might be tempted to stay on—to save expense. She’s going to take the first vacation she has had in years, and visit some relations in the West, and she has been able to rent her house for three months.” “Then I suppose that you will go up to Vermont for the summer?” Pamela received this question in silence, and Julia saw that it had been ill-advised. Thus for several minutes they rode on without speaking. The cool air was refreshing; the electric lights here and there at the side of the road threw strange shadows from the trees. There was a certain pleasant weirdness in the scene. Pamela was the first to speak. “I do not really wish to go up to Vermont. They think that I ought to teach. They think that it is foolish for me to continue at college when I might be earning. Besides, my aunt’s house is crowded now, and there isn’t a room that I could have. If I knew what I ought to do next year, I could tell better about this summer.” “Do next year?” repeated Julia. “Why, you wouldn’t think of doing anything but come back to college—with _your_ record.” If Julia had noticed Pamela’s smile, she would have known that its wanness was not entirely the result of the flickering electric light. Her voice, however, betrayed her. “It may not be wholly a matter of choice.” “But you’ve applied for a scholarship?” Julia realized now that the question was a question of money. “Yes, but I can’t know about it until the autumn. There are so few scholarships and so many applicants.” “I suppose that we ought to turn our faces homeward. It’s getting late,” said Julia. Then as they waited by the side of the road for the car bound Cambridge-ward, Julia saw what she ought to do. During the ride she had been pondering, and had it been any one but Pamela she would have made an offer of direct help for the next college year. This would have meant so little to her, and so much to the Vermont girl. But there was something in Pamela—an independence of spirit in spite of her shrinking demeanor—that prevented her doing this. Yet now as from a clear sky she seemed to hear the echo of a speech that had actually fallen unheeded on her ears a week or two before. It was the lamentation of a friend of Mrs. Barlow’s who bewailed her young son’s deficiencies in Greek. “It’s disgraceful that Teddy is so unwilling to study, and his father is determined to have him enter with Greek. If I had my way he’d give it up. Now I suppose that we shall have to have a tutor. It will be a nuisance to have an extra man in the house, but I suppose it can’t be helped. If it were anything but Greek I suppose that we might have a woman, but as it is, I suppose that we must make the best of it.” As this conversation came back to her, Julia wondered that at the time she had not thought of Pamela. Possibly it was because the words had not been addressed to her directly that they had made so little impression. That very night she would write to Mrs. Hadwin, and if it was not too late, she would do her best to get the position for Pamela. “Pamela,” she whispered, after they had taken their seats in the returning car, “Pamela, I feel almost certain that I can find something for you to do this summer. If it isn’t the thing that I have in mind this minute it will be something similar. I can’t say more at present, but I wish that you would trust me and believe me entirely your friend.” “Thank you, of course I trust you. You have been so kind ever since the very first day. You remember my fountain pen?” Both girls laughed at the remembrance. “Because I’ve been so despondent this evening you mustn’t think that I am always forlorn,” said Pamela, “only it is very hard sometimes for a girl to work out things all alone, and I really have no one to advise me.” “Sometimes I feel very lonely, too,” said Julia; and as Pamela’s hand touched hers in a mute response, she felt that they were now really going to understand each other. That very evening Julia wrote to Mrs. Hadwin, and so strong did she make her case that before the end of the week all the arrangements had been made, and Pamela was the engaged tutor for Teddy. Her term was to last three months from the last week in June, and Pamela was to accompany the family to the seashore. The change of air was in itself likely to be good for Pamela, and Julia congratulated herself on the sudden thought that had brought this piece of good luck to her friend. “Yet if Pamela had not been able to show such a fine record for her work in the classics, any effort of mine might have been perfectly useless.” XII HARVARD CLASS DAY Had Jane Townall stayed in Cambridge until Commencement, Julia might have had more interest in the Radcliffe Class Day. But illness in her family had called Jane home as soon as her examinations ended. “I am sorry not to get my degree from the hands of the President at Commencement, but I’m glad to escape the flurry of Class Day. I really could not afford the expense. I’m coming back, though, for my Ph.D. sometime. I’ll take that in person.” “There’ll be no Radcliffe Ph.D. next year, nor yet the year after,” said Polly, shaking her head. “Oh, it will be years before I return,” responded Jane cheerfully. “I must save the money first. By that time women will be receiving the Ph.D. from Harvard itself.” “Doubt it!” cried Polly. “Well, I’d come back cheerfully for the two years of graduate study, even without the Ph.D. at the end.” “I’m not with you there,” interposed Clarissa, who had joined the group. “When I’ve earned a Ph.D. I’ll try to get it.” “Then you wouldn’t have been a contented Annex graduate, with a certificate instead of a degree, stating that you had received an education the equivalent of that for which the degree of A.B. is given at Harvard College.” “Poor things!” replied Clarissa. “No, I couldn’t have borne all that they bore. I’m not that kind of a pioneer.” Jane had secured a fine position in an Indiana High School for the coming year, and her regrets at leaving Cambridge were mingled with pleasure at the prospect opening before her of having a fair income. Julia and Ruth returned to Cambridge the day before Harvard Class Day. As evening came they worried about a few overhanging clouds, yet when Friday came, the girls, looking through the trees shading their window, saw that it was a regular Class Day sky, blue, cloudless, while the air coming in over the casement was warm and sultry. “Julia,” cried Ruth at breakfast, “how _can_ you be so calm? I feel as if I might be Brenda, I am so excited. I’ve always longed for a real Harvard Class Day. I was only a little girl when my cousin Augustus was a Senior, and I remember how I stood about and watched his sisters dressing for his spread. Even a year in Cambridge hasn’t destroyed the glamour surrounding the day. Yesterday, when I saw that the seats had been put up around the Tree, I felt that the curtain was about to be lifted from the show. You are too calm, Julia, you really are, and you have such a lovely dress!” “It is no lovelier than yours, Ruth. Come to my room when you are dressed; I am very anxious to see it on you.” The girls were now on their way upstairs, and when a half-hour later Ruth entered Julia’s room, each girl gave an exclamation of delight. A third person might have found it hard to tell which dress was the more beautiful, Julia’s white organdy, with its rows and rows of tiny lace-edged ruffles, or Ruth’s yellow muslin worn over a pale yellow slip. Ruth was a brunette with Irish blue eyes, and her yellow gown and leghorn hat with yellow crush roses was very becoming. Julia’s white hat had a pink lining, and was very becoming to her rather colorless type. “You look like a white rose just touched with pink,” exclaimed Ruth, in a rather unwonted vein of poetry. The two girls walked in a leisurely fashion to Fay House, where, according to the arrangements made by Mrs. Barlow, Toby Gostar, Nora’s younger brother, met them to escort them to Memorial Hall. Here in the Chapel Brenda and Nora and Mrs. Barlow were waiting. “We were so afraid that you would be late,” cried Brenda as they approached. “You know that our tickets won’t be good for anything after half-past ten. The doors are opened to the public then.” “As it is now only quarter-past ten, Brenda, your anxiety was rather misplaced, but as we are now all here we can hasten to our seats.” Mrs. Barlow, gathering up her voluminous skirts, marshalled her quartette to the narrow wicket gate through which so many, many thousands of persons have entered Sanders Theatre, and up the broad stairs into the great amphitheatre. Toby stayed behind to take his chances with the ticketless throng, crowding around the outer door. “It’s like a garden,” said Ruth, gazing about on the rows of seats rising tier above tier, filled for the most part with young women and girls, whose light gowns and flower-trimmed hats gave the place the aspect of a flower garden. There were mothers there, of course, or an occasional father; but on the whole the great interior was given up to girls, who fanned themselves and listened to the orchestra, and wondered if it wasn’t almost time for the Class to appear. Very promptly at eleven o’clock the Class _did_ appear, fresh from the service in Appleton Chapel and the breakfast at the President’s. The Marshals led the way, one of whom was Philip’s friend, Tom Hearst; and as the rest of the Seniors in cap and gown followed closely and took their places in the seats on the floor, every girl in the theatre tried to identify her own brother or cousin or friend. “It does seem too bad about Philip,” and Nora leaned over toward Julia; “besides, if he hadn’t failed so, Edith would have been here. Just think of her near England at this very minute, when she ought to have been here.” “I dare say that she is more comfortable at this very minute than we are. Only imagine how refreshing an ocean breeze would be blowing over our heads.” “Oh, Julia, how terribly matter of fact you are!” Julia’s feelings, however, were deeper than her jesting words implied. In the group below, as she recognized one after another of Philip’s friends, she realized how much he was losing. There is only one Class Day for each undergraduate; and although he may make up scholastic deficiencies, and get his degree with some other class, if he loses his Class Day, something has gone that can never be made up to him. So although Julia listened to the Oration with its review of the Class history and its promises for the future, although she gazed with admiration at the fluent Poet whose lofty lines were delivered in a rather feeble voice, although she laughed at the witticisms and local hits of the Ivy Oration (without always seeing the force of the joke), her thoughts sometimes were wandering far away. Indeed, it is to be feared that the last part of the Oration was lost upon her, for when the Class rose in a body to sing the Class Ode to the air of “Fair Harvard,” she was surprised to find that the first part of the Class Day programme was ended. Of course, like many others, Nora and Brenda and Julia and Ruth lingered to scan the scattering throng for familiar faces. Naturally, too, Tom and Will and other Seniors whom they knew came up to shake hands with them, and receive their congratulations on having reached this point in their career; and naturally, too, these same young men escorted Mrs. Barlow and her charges first to the “Pudding” spread (where nothing resembling pudding was to be had, except, perhaps, the ice called frozen pudding), and then from the “Pudding” to one or two private spreads, and then—why, then before they knew it it was four o’clock, and every one was wondering if it wasn’t almost time to go to the Tree. Where had the day gone? “Ah, here you are!” exclaimed a cheerful voice, as Nora and Julia stood on the lawn of Wadsworth House, a little tired, a little the worse for wear, holding their empty plates, and wondering how they had managed to lose sight of Mrs. Barlow and Brenda and Ruth. “Oh, papa!” cried Nora, for the cheerful voice belonged to Dr. Gostar. “Oh, papa, I didn’t know that you were coming out. How delightful! Are you going to the Tree? But there, I suppose that you haven’t a ticket; they’re so very hard to get.” “Ticket!” and there was genuine merriment in Dr. Gostar’s laugh. “Why, you are forgetting who I am. I’m a graduate, and Class Day belongs partly to the graduates. At least, the Tree part of it does.” “Oh, then we’ll see you there. What fun!” “You’ll hear me certainly. Really, I ought to be saving myself now for the cheering. But I met Mrs. Barlow just outside; she had to go with Brenda and Ruth to Matthews for a little while. Elmer Robson was with them; there was something in his room that he was anxious to show Brenda. Mrs. Barlow felt that she could go when I promised to take you under my wing. We are to meet in Stoughton, where Will Hardon has a room looking out on the Tree.” “But I thought that his rooms were in Holworthy?” “So they are. But he thought that it would be pleasant for his guests to have a room to rest in before going to the Tree and near it. By the way, we have no time to spare,” looking at his watch. “If you are ready, young ladies, I shall be happy to escort you, although I’m rather surprised that you haven’t some younger cavalier.” “Well, papa, we have had, but you see the Seniors have all gone off now to dress for the Tree, and even Toby, after he had gone with us to one or two spreads, seemed to grow restless. I suppose he thinks there’d be more fun with some of his classmates. There are a few undergraduates hanging about on the outskirts of things.” “I hope that he hasn’t neglected you.” “Oh, no, indeed”—Julia was the speaker—“oh, no indeed, he has been remarkably entertaining. He pointed out all kinds of amusing college personages, and cleared the way for us through several crowds, and saw that our plates were heaped with ices, and altogether has been very helpful.” “He really has, papa,” added Nora. “You see the Seniors can pay little attention to any single person, they have so many to look after. It’s the greatest fun to see them trying to be equally attentive to half a dozen persons at once when all the time they’re dying to talk to some one person by herself. Even Will Hardon, who seldom is disturbed, was half beside himself. He hadn’t had a chance for a word with Ruth, and wherever he was to-day there were three tall, thin cousins of his from New York who wished to know about everything and to see everything, and who hardly left his side for a moment. I think that Ruth was disappointed, too.” “Why, Nora!” and Julia shook her head in disapproval. But Dr. Gostar was too much absorbed in the scenes in the Yard to notice this speech of Nora’s. “Why, papa, you seem to see a great many people you know.” “I certainly do, daughter; that is one of the charms of Class Day. Presently I may run upon some old classmate whom I have not seen for twenty-five years. He is here escorting his daughters; and although my head is gray, and his may be bald, we shall rush into each other’s arms and—” “Why, who is he, papa?” cried Nora, without realizing that she was interrupting. “Oh, I haven’t the least idea; the particular man does not matter. It will be some one with whom I can renew my youth. Why, if it wasn’t for Class Day some of us old fellows would forget that we had ever been young.” “Why, papa, nobody considers you old. I heard Mrs. Everlie the other day call you a perfect boy.” “I certainly feel like one to-day, escorting two fair damsels through the College Yard.” “Oh, listen! listen!” cried Julia, as the sound of gruff huzzas came to them. “They have begun to cheer the buildings; you know that that is the ceremony,—a pause before each old building, and a loud cheer for it,—the Seniors’ farewell to Harvard.” They had now almost reached Stoughton, pushing their way through the crowd. On the steps of University Hall and other buildings, rows of people were seated, who evidently were mere sight-seers, without any real connection with the Class. There were small boys and girls among them, and men and women in holiday dress, evidently sight-seers from the City. In the throng hurrying across the Yard there were now a good many undergraduates, and anxious chaperons trying to collect their charges, and pretty girls in delicate dresses hurrying toward the Tree enclosure. From the door of Stoughton Dr. Gostar and his party hastened upstairs to the upper room which had been secured for them. It was a large, square, old-fashioned room, furnished rather more simply than those occupied by Philip and Will in Holworthy, and it was far plainer than the elegant apartments of Tom Hearst in Claverly. As the others had not yet arrived, Julia and Nora tiptoed around, looking at the curious gray and blue steins on the mantle-piece, the fencing foils and masks on the wall, the two or three old colored prints of stage coach and sporting scenes. “Hm, hm,” cried Nora, “whoever he is, the classics do not occupy all his time. Just look at those membership certificates; he seems to belong to every athletic society in the college. And his books, where are his books?” “Why, here,” cried Julia, “on this shelf behind the door. There are a whole dozen of them;” and Nora, stepping forward, read off their titles, which proved, by the way, to be the titles almost entirely of college text-books. “But, my dear, you mustn’t expect them all to be book worms; it takes every kind of individual to make up a college, just as in the outside world,” remonstrated Dr. Gostar in answer to Nora’s gibes at the non-literary taste of the owner of this room. Before more could be said, Mrs. Barlow and Ruth and Brenda appeared, attended by Toby and another undergraduate, who was introduced as the owner of the room. The latter was a mild-mannered, young-looking Junior, not at all the athletic individual—at least in appearance—whom the girls had pictured from the trophies and other adornments of the room. “There, Mrs. Barlow, I hand my charges over to you,” and Dr. Gostar hurried off to join the Alumni around the Tree. In a few minutes Mrs. Barlow and the others followed, leaving the room in Stoughton to some other guests of Will’s, who were to watch the Tree exercises from the windows. Already the throng in the Yard was crowding toward the Tree enclosure, and the ticket holders had hard work to thread their way among curious by-standers. Within the enclosure the sun beat down hotly, except in one corner where the brick walls of the neighboring buildings cast a shade. Following the boys, Mrs. Barlow and the girls scrambled up over the rough wooden benches,—“just like circus seats,” said Nora,—and at last, a little out of breath, and with many apologies to those whom they disturbed in their progress, they reached their own places. Now, although Brenda and her friends did not then realize it, these Tree exercises were to have a peculiar interest from being almost the last under the walls of Stoughton. The space was too limited for the thousands who felt that they had a right to be spectators, and already plans were making for a change of place and a somewhat different performance. As the Alumni came in, taking position some distance from the Tree, the girls caught sight of Dr. Gostar and two or three sedate Bostonians of his age seating themselves on the grass, and looking as cheerful and merry as the youngest undergraduate there. The Alumni had marched within the enclosure with a band of music at the head, and then had followed the Freshmen, with the Sophomores second and the Juniors last. Each formed a separate circle around the Tree, and when the signal was given all rose and cheered lustily for every college official from the President to John the Orangeman. The Chief Marshal, a tall, handsome fellow, led the cheering, and at last at a given signal the students in each circle, joining hands, whirled at a mad rate around the Tree. When they had sung the Class Ode, the Marshal threw his hat against the Tree, and then the wild scramble for the flowers began. It was difficult for those who knew them best to recognize their especial Seniors in the shocking bad clothes and old hats that they wore. But many a mother, when she discovered her boy, was sure that he must come away with broken limbs, if he escaped alive from the wild scrimmage. They pommeled one another, formed themselves into human ladders, flung one another off from the sides of the Tree. Yet strange to say, no one received serious injury, and the few who reached the glowing wreath were loudly cheered, even by those who thought the whole affair rather brutal. Those who stripped the wreath from the Tree flung the fragments down among their classmates, and in the end nearly every one had a flower or two as a memento. As Tom and Will pressed through the crowd with fairly large bouquets—at least they could be seen by Brenda and her friends—the girls wondered if any of the trophies should pass to them. While they stood for a moment waiting a chance to pass down to the Yard, Mrs. Barlow pointed out one distinguished person after another among the spectators at the Tree, including the British Minister, the Secretary of the Navy, the Governor of New York, and innumerable literary and professional men of note. Many of them undoubtedly were there as relatives of Seniors, and some probably found it a distinction to be the father of a boy who was the idol of his class for this thing or that,—athletics and social graces sometimes ranking ahead of scholarship. When Will and Tom reached Mrs. Barlow’s group their flowers were rather impartially distributed among the four, and the boys hurried on to array themselves in proper Senior garb. They all met again at the Beck spread, and from that they went to one or two smaller teas, sitting in windows that overlooked the quadrangle until the Yard had been illuminated. “Fairyland only faintly describes it,” said Julia, looking at the wonderful labyrinth of lanterns and colored lights shining above the crowds in gay attire threading the paths, or seated on the grass. Julia was loath to leave the scene even for a glimpse of the dancers in Memorial and the Gymnasium. When an opportunity therefore came for her to go back to the rooms in Holworthy under Toby’s protection, she was glad enough to go. She was a little tired now, and did not sit in the window, and when Toby seemed restless, she advised him to go back to Memorial, as she would be perfectly comfortable in the easy-chair that he had drawn up for her. She added that she would not be at all lonely. Hardly had Toby left her when a familiar voice fell on her ear. “Toby told me that you were in here, Julia, but where are you?” Julia rose from the easy-chair, the deep back of which hid her from view. “Why, Philip! How in the world do you happen to be here? I thought—” “No, I haven’t actually left this part of the world. I’ve been down to the shore for a day or two getting my things together. I’m off to-night by the midnight train. But I couldn’t resist a glance at Class Day. Besides,” a trifle less defiantly, “I thought that I might see you, Julia.” “Oh, yes,” replied Julia, “we’re all here, Ruth and Brenda and Nora; they’ll be coming back from Memorial after a while.” “Oh, I’ll be out of the way before that. I made Toby swear not to say a word about me. No, I didn’t expect really to see any one, though I hoped that I might run across you.” “I’m awfully sorry that things have gone badly with you, but next year—” “No, I’m not coming back next year, nor am I going to cry about spilled milk. What’s the good? Nobody really cares what becomes of a fellow. Of course a family is mortified when he doesn’t get his degree, and I’ve had it heavy enough from my father for the money he’s had to put up for me. But you are a sensible girl, Julia, and I’ve wanted to tell you that in many ways you’ve done me a lot of good. Sometime, perhaps, I may show you that I’ve profited by some of your advice.” “I’ve never given you any real advice.” “Indeed you have. Of course I’ve had it from other people, too. But you’ve said some things that really have made an impression. But there, what’s the use of talking? Sometime you’ll see that I’m not as black as I’m painted. So now I must be off, for I’ve some things to attend to in the Square, and I don’t want the others to find me here. There’d be such a beastly lot of explaining,” and so with a sudden farewell, Philip hurried out of the room. Julia, looking from the window, followed him for a moment until he was lost in the crowd. At this moment the Glee Club, stationed on the green, sang “Fair Harvard,” and Julia wondered if the pathetic music struck Philip’s ears with the sadness with which it fell on hers. Not long after this Mrs. Barlow and the girls appeared. The latter were by no means ready to go home, tired though they were after their long day. But Mrs. Barlow was firm; and in spite of the protests of Tom and Will and one or two others, they left the Yard before half-past ten. XIII VARIOUS AMBITIONS The summer passed quickly away, as vacations have a fashion of doing, even when one is young, and Julia and Ruth and Polly and Clarissa and Lois and all the other college friends met again in October, well and happy. Polly had been at Atlantic City, Clarissa had joined her family at the White Mountains, Pamela had been on the South Shore with her pupil, Nora had spent the summer in Maine. Lois alone of this group of friends had had practically no change of scene; she had stayed in Newton all summer, and yet she returned to college looking as bright as any of the others. Julia’s summer does not form properly a part of her Radcliffe days, and yet it is only fair to say that Julia’s summer had been somewhat different from what might have been prophesied in June. The first weeks had been spent in attendance on her Aunt Anna, who had fallen ill with a slow fever in the early spring. When she was better the doctor had ordered a complete change of air, with the result that Mr. and Mrs. Barlow and the two girls had made a tour of the British Provinces. Coming back to college from so many points of the compass, the Sophomores all had naturally much to tell. They registered themselves promptly on the first Thursday of the term; they chose their electives and changed their minds as often as the authorities would permit. They studied the notices on the bulletin board and the schedule of recitations, and advised one another in tones much more confident than a year ago. They did their part at the Freshman reception to make the incoming class feel perfectly at home, and they began to develop a class spirit. Now “class spirit” is something which had only just begun to develop at Radcliffe, and indeed at this time some of the upper class girls, absorbed in their work, were disinclined to believe that it had an existence. Different things were contributing to this class feeling. One was the increasing interest in athletics. Each class had its basket ball team and its own athletes, or gymnasts as perhaps we ought to say, in whose triumphs it took a genuine pride. Clarissa had come to the front as one of the best athletes of her class, and the Sophomores with her help expected to lead in the spring meet. Julia, too, found herself suddenly conspicuous from a very simple thing, or at least it seemed simple to her. She had always had some talent for musical composition, and had studied Composition before entering Radcliffe. But the course in Harmony under the distinguished head of the Music Department had been a revelation to her, and she had begun to venture on little flights of her own. One of her songs, a setting of William Watson’s, “Tell me not now,” Polly had picked up as it lay in manuscript on her desk. Now Polly had a sweet, bird-like voice, and she rushed to the piano and trilled off: “Tell me not now, if love for love Thou canst return, Now while around us and above Day’s flambeaux burn. Not in clear noon, with speech as clear, Thy heart avow, For every gossip wind to hear; Tell me not now.” Julia herself, as she listened, found her own music more interesting than she had imagined it. Polly, when she had finished, turned around with an amused expression: “Well, well, I am perfectly surprised that you are so sentimental, Julia Bourne.” “Oh, nonsense!” responded Julia, “but you sing it like an angel.” “Yes,” said Polly, “this time I’ll accept the compliment without protest, for with your leave (or without it) I’m going to sing this at the next Idler. I’ve been asked to sing something, and I’ll take care to let every one know that you are the composer of this sentimental ode. You! the stern person who used to frown on me last spring when I wanted to go to Riverside on canoe expeditions that meant a _solitude à deux_. Ah, Julia, this song shows that you are human like the rest of us;” and Polly held high above her head the manuscript that Julia tried to seize. Thus Julia made her first appearance before her fellow-students as a composer, for Polly sang “Tell me not now” with great effect that Friday afternoon; and Julia, who hitherto had had comparatively few acquaintances outside of her special set, now found herself an object of interest to the whole club. “The next thing,” said Ruth, with genuine pride in Julia’s triumph, “the next thing we’ll have you composing an operetta.” “Nonsense!” cried Julia. “An operetta! I couldn’t do it.” “Why not? Three or four operettas have been composed and given by Radcliffe girls with great success. Why, I came out with my mother the year ‘A Copper Complication’ was given, and I never saw anything more entertaining in my life. What one girl can accomplish another can, I mean if she has the same kind of talent. Why, there have been several Radcliffe operettas—‘Princess Perfection,’ ‘A Copper Complication.’” The urgings of Polly and Ruth, however, might not have led Julia to take up the work had not the Emmanuel Society needed funds. It had committed itself to assist in maintaining a reading-room at the North End for working girls, and its expenses had been heavier than the first estimates. In no way could money be so readily raised as through an operetta, and as Julia was especially interested in this Society, she at last consented to see what she could do. “For any one with talent like yours it isn’t so very hard,” said Polly persuasively. “Ruth and I will help you with the book, and then you must have some good soprano solos—for me—and some manly contralto solos, probably for Clarissa, if we can only get her to take them; and then there must be a soubrette song or two—we’ll find the soubrette, and there must be a man’s funny part, like Charles River, the ‘winter man’ in ‘A Copper Complication,’” and Polly spun round the room, singing: “Now since men are always busy in this lovely summer time, I get my little innings when I can, As I wanted to offset a bit the summer girl’s éclat, I call myself a winter man. I drive out, I dine out at functions divine, At parties I dance with the belle of the ball. It is in the winter I have my good time.” “Oh, no indeed!” interrupted Ruth. “Julia’s opera will have no frivolous Charles River. Her hero, I’m sure, will be a most serious person with high purpose.” “And a low voice, that is, low for an alto,” cried the irrepressible Polly. “There,” said Julia, smiling, “as my part is to be so small, I need not have hesitated about undertaking it. You are arranging for the words and the speakers, and the music is only—” “Now, Julia, of _course_ the _music’s_ the thing, the chief thing, but there’s a certain type of song that’s taking, and we have to think what will best suit our prima donnas, when once we have secured them. You have no idea how shy they are. I shouldn’t care to be the business manager of this affair,” and Polly flung herself on the couch, while the others laughed at her affected melancholy. Yet in spite of this badinage, the girls of Julia’s group, as well as some others with special literary or dramatic talent, began to work for the success of the operetta. The music was left entirely to Julia; but the libretto, or “book” as they all preferred to call it, was to be a composite production. The sentimental lyrics were nearly all assigned to Ruth; the comic words for the most part grew. Girls are more considerate than boys. Their jokes are seldom “grinds” on the professors, and they are even fairly tender toward the various branches of a college curriculum. The gibes, therefore, of Radcliffe plays were more apt to be directed toward local faults, such as muddy sidewalks and dusty streets. Yet after all, the operetta was entirely secondary to regular college work. Hardly a girl in Julia’s class sought the name of “grind,” and few deserved it. The absence of the dormitory system, the very fact that many Radcliffe students reside with their parents while attending college, makes for a normal life in which home interests and society have their place as well as study. This is as it should be, and is not to "but you can't keep me from thinking it, anyway." "All right, then, that's agreed, and we'll let it go at that," said Bert, with a smile, "we'll be up to see you as soon as the doctor will let us, won't we, fellows?" turning to Dick and Tom. Of course they were willing, so it was agreed that they should visit the engineer's tent, the next day but one. This matter settled, the three comrades took a cordial leave of Mr. Hartley, and made their way back to their own quarters. Until now they had not realized how tired they were, but before they had gotten to their room they all felt as though they could scarcely keep awake. They managed to defer their sleep long enough to eat a hearty supper, however, but then "made a dash for the hay," as Tom expressed it. It did not take them long to get to sleep that night, and they were too tired even to discuss the exciting happenings of this eventful day. With the characteristic recuperative power of youth, however, they were up bright and early the next day, and all three expressed themselves as feeling "as fit as a fiddle." "But just the same," remarked Dick, "I feel like loafing around to-day and taking things easy. Let's go up to the stone crushing works and watch them. That's my idea of the most restful thing in the world--to watch somebody else working." "It certainly is," agreed Bert, with a laugh, "but I'm afraid the 'somebody else' might not appreciate your philosophy." "Oh, that's all right," said Dick. "Some time when I'm working, the other fellow is welcome to watch me, and then he'll be getting his rest." "Huh," remarked Tom. "I'd hate to have to wait for my rest until you started laboring. I'm afraid I'd surely die from overwork before that happened." "Oh, don't worry about your dying from overwork," retorted Dick, "that's my idea of the last thing in the world to be afraid of. What do you think, Bert?" "Oh, I don't imagine any of us will get heart failure very soon from that cause," laughed Bert, "but here we are at the workings already, so let's proceed to take your 'rest cure,' Dick." It seems hardly probable, however, that any invalid, suffering from "nerves" or some kindred disorder, would have selected this as an ideal place to recuperate. Everywhere the greatest activity was apparent, and the combined din of the different machines was a thing to be remembered. A steam shovel rattled and puffed, cement mixers crashed, and compressed air drills hammered perseveringly at the living rock. Every once in a while, work would cease at some point, and the laborers would stand around expectantly. Then there would come a muffled roar from some exploded blast, and a cloud of rocks, dirt, and smoke would shoot upwards. Then the men would fall to again with renewed energy, the giant steam shovel would be set to work, and a few more yards of rock would be carried away. Thus the work proceeded without intermission, and the boys, although now somewhat used to the sights, looked on fascinated. There was something very wonderful and awe-inspiring about the whole process that held the boys spellbound. "Just think of it," said Bert, after a long silence. "Imagine us standing maybe half a mile away from this canal and seeing some big ocean liner going through it. Why, it will look as though the ship were going over the solid ground." "That's what it will, all right," replied Dick. "It's certainly the biggest thing ever." "I should think it was," said Tom. "I can't think of anything else that even compares with it.". "No, neither can I," said Bert, thoughtfully. "That is, no practicable project. Of course wild schemes come up now and then to change the earth's course, or some other crazy idea like that. I remember reading of a plan like that somewhere. It seems its originator, whoever he was, planned to build a great ring of iron all around the earth at the equator, and then charge it with electricity. He figures that the immense magnetic attraction generated in that way would change the earth's course by acting on neighboring planets. I haven't much confidence in the plan, though," and, as Bert said this, he looked at Tom, slyly. "Confidence!" exclaimed Tom, with a contemptuous snort. "Why, of all the fool schemes I ever heard of that's the limit. I shouldn't think you'd even----" but here he caught the twinkle in Bert's eye, and stopped abruptly. "Ha, Ha!" roared Dick, "my, but you had Tom going that time, Bert, he thought you were in earnest about that." "Well, why shouldn't I think he was in earnest?" growled Tom. "He's pretty near foolish enough even to believe in a demented idea like that. I wouldn't have been surprised if he had." "Well, never mind, old timer," said Bert, "I put one over on you that time, though, I guess. You'll have to admit it." "Yes, I guess you did," said Tom, "but I'll get even for that sometime. Don't be surprised if you find a little rat poison in your soup some day. That's the only punishment I can think of that would fit the crime." "Oh, that's all right," laughed Bert. "If it's like most rat poisons, all it will do is to make me fat and strong. I remember a friend of mine whose father was a farmer. He was telling me how his father scattered poison all around his barn in the hope of killing off a few of the pests, but he said that all the effect it seemed to have was to make them hungry, so that they ate more grain and feed than before. Maybe that's the way it will work with me, only the comparison isn't very flattering." "It isn't, for a fact," said Dick, "but I hope in this case Tom isn't as blood thirsty as he sounds." "Well, I might be persuaded to postpone the execution," admitted Tom, with a grin. "I'm always open to an offer, and a little matter of a five dollar bill or so would buy me off." "All right, consider yourself paid," said Bert. "I'd rather owe it to you all my life than cheat you out of it." "Much obliged, I'm sure," replied Tom, sarcastically. "As soon as I get the five spot I'll blow you both to a swell dinner." "Good night," exclaimed Dick. "I hope I don't have to go hungry until that happens. I have a feeling that I'd lose considerable weight." "You'll have a _long_ wait, that's certain," replied Tom, and prepared to take to his heels. The only indication Bert and Dick gave that they heard this atrocious pun was a couple of hollow groans and melancholy head shakes. "Poor old Tom," mourned Dick at length, "poor old Tom. I've feared for some time he was going off his head and now I know it. That's proof beyond question." "Don't let it turn your hair gray," retorted Tom. "As long as I don't worry about my condition you don't need to. But I'll promise to be good and not do it again, anyway. That was a pretty rotten joke, I'll have to admit." "That's all right," said Bert, "we forgive you. I'm glad to see that you realize what a crime it was." After this they fell to discussing the events of the day before, and became so interested that they could hardly believe it was lunch time, when the whistles blew and the men threw down their tools and prepared to take a well earned rest for a brief hour. "Well," said Bert, glancing at his watch, "I guess it's about time we hit the trail toward the nearest eats emporium. Now that its called to my attention, I begin to realize that I'm hungry." The others also discovered symptoms of a healthy appetite, so without further loss of time they hurried back to their 'base of supplies' as Tom put it. "If we're as hungry as this without having done much all the morning, what would we be if we had been working since eight o'clock?" queried Dick, and the others were unable to give him a satisfactory answer. "I guess they'd have to stop work, owing to a shortage in the food supply," said Bert, and his companions laughingly agreed with him. They made a hearty lunch, and then returned to the scene of the excavations. There were a thousand interesting things to watch, and the afternoon passed very quickly. Their attention was specially attracted by one giant steam shovel that rattled and puffed like some untiring monster. The engineer guiding it directed its every motion with a touch of one of the levers close to his hand, and it seemed as though the machine were a living creature and he its brain. The great scoop would drop with a roar of chains passing through pulleys, and then, as the main engine began to puff, would rise slowly but with irresistible force.. Then a pair of auxiliary cylinders mounted on the beam of the shovel would begin to work, and the big scoop with its load of dirt and rocks would swing around and stop over one of the dirt cars. The engineer's assistant would pull a rope attached to the scoop, a catch would be released, and the bottom of the scoop would swing open, letting the load fall into the waiting car. This process would be repeated again and again, and then, when the shovel had scooped up all the dirt around it, it would be moved forward a few feet, under its own power, to a new base of operations. It seemed that its power was almost limitless, but at last there came a time when the boys thought it would meet an insurmountable obstacle. Close to where they sat, a big stump projected from the ground. Part of its gnarled and twisted roots was exposed, but a good deal of it was firmly imbedded in the earth. The steam shovel had worked its way along, until now it had reached a spot directly in front of this stump. The boys thought that some laborers would be sent to uproot it, so that the shovel could proceed, but there was no sign of this being done. "Say!" exclaimed Dick. "I'll bet any money they mean to uproot that stump with the shovel, but I don't believe it can be done. Why, it would take a charge of dynamite to get that up." "It certainly looks pretty solid," said Bert, "but they must know what they're doing. We won't have to wait long, though, to find out. Look! they're bringing the scoop up under it now!" The three comrades watched intently as the big scoop dug in under the stump. As it came fairly up against the obstacle it slowed and almost stopped, and the boys caught their breaths. But the engineer opened the throttle a trifle more, and the stump moved! Slowly it gave way, one root after another snapping off with a loud report, and at last was lifted clear of the ground. "Well, what do you know about that!" exclaimed Tom. "I thought the old steam shovel was up against it for fair, that time." "So did I," said Bert, "but it fooled us good and proper." "It's such things as that steam shovel that make the canal possible," said Dick, "just imagine the time it would take to dig that stuff out by the old method of shoveling. Why, it would take so long that we'd never live to see it finished." "Yes, I guess you're right," said Bert, "and look at those compressed air drills working over there. Think how long it would take to bore out those holes by the old method of hammering a drill into the rock. There's no doubt, that, as you say, modern machinery is the only thing responsible for this work. It's a wonderful thing, any way you look at it." It was indeed a subject admitting of much speculation, and the boys never tired of talking about it. In this way the afternoon passed very quickly, and when work was stopped they returned to their quarters. On the way back, Bert said, "We might as well make arrangements now as later, fellows, for going to see Mr. Hartley. You know we promised to call on him to-morrow. What time shall we get there?" "Oh, I should think right after lunch would be about the best time, don't you?" said Dick, and as there seemed to be no objection to this plan, they adopted it unanimously. They arose early the next morning, and had ample time to take a long walk before breakfast. "Not that it's at all necessary," remarked Bert, "I don't very well see how any of us could have much better appetites than we have already." "Yes, but if we didn't get all the exercise that we do, the appetites might not last very long," replied Bert. They did not prolong their ramble long enough to interfere with breakfast, and got back to their quarters just in the nick of time. "Another ten minutes," exclaimed Tom, "and we would have missed some of the eats. We certainly do have close escapes from disaster at times." "It would certainly have been an awful calamity," grinned Bert, "but I think we must have some sixth sense that leads us back here in time for meals. I don't remember that we have ever been late to one yet." "No, and we're not going to be, if I can help it," said Dick, and they all fell to in earnest. Breakfast over, they selected a level spot not far from their quarters and had a "catch." Bert found his arm somewhat rusty, as he had not done any pitching to speak of for quite a while, but soon limbered up, and began "shooting them over" in his old time form. The morning passed quickly in the pursuit of this and other athletic exercises, and after a light luncheon the three comrades set out to visit Mr. Hartley in accordance with the plan they had formed the day before. It was not a long walk to the engineer's tent, and they made short work of it. Needless to say, Mr. Hartley was more than glad to see them, and expressed himself cordially. "Sit down, sit down!" he said heartily, after he had shaken hands with them. "I've been looking forward to this visit with great pleasure. I'm used to a pretty active life, and I hate to be laid up even for a day. The doctor tells me I've got to have a complete rest for a few days, though, and I suppose he knows best." "Well, the doctor isn't always right in these cases," said Bert, with a smile, "although he probably is in this. I remember a good joke I heard about that once." "Go ahead and tell it to us," urged Mr. Hartley. "Oh, it's about an Irishman, Mike we'll call him, who had been sick for a long time. At last the day came, when, to all appearances, he had finally given up the ghost, and the family physician was as called in more as a matter of form than anything else. He made the customary tests, and at last pronounced poor Mike dead. But just then Mike suddenly sat up in bed. 'You're a liar, docther!' he said. 'Oi'm not dead at all, at all.' But at this point his wife stepped up. 'There, there, Mike,' she said, soothingly, 'lie down again. The `doctor knows best.'" There was a roar at this. "Ha, ha!" laughed Mr. Hartley, "that's a pretty good one. That man must have held a large life insurance policy, I should say, judging by his wife's conduct." "Very likely," grinned Bert. "But I can't vouch for that." Mr. Hartley then related one or two of his pet stories, and soon they were all on the best of terms. After a while the conversation drifted around to local topics, and the boys were much interested in Mr. Hartley's description of places and happenings in the country bordering the "big ditch." "Yes, there are more curious and unheard of places in this little strip of country than in any other place I know of, comparable to it in size," he said. "Why, if a quarter of the stories the natives tell are true, it is a veritable wonderland. And I think some of them are true. With my own eyes I have seen some of the things they talk about." "Tell us of some of them, won't you?" requested Bert, and the engineer seemed nothing loath. "There is one experience in particular that comes to my mind," he said, "that I have always meant to follow up at the first opportunity. It was while quite a party of us were out hunting, with three of the natives as guides. It was along toward the beginning of operations on the canal, and we were held up by a delay in delivering some of the machinery, so had plenty of time on our hands. Well, as I say, we started out bright and early one morning, led by the three guides, who had brought a strange story into camp. They told us of a ruined city they had discovered in the heart of the jungle. According to them, this old town covered miles of territory, and was presided over by some demon who claimed the lives of all who penetrated within its boundaries. And we were led to give some credence to their story by the fact that while they agreed to guide us to the city, they expressly stipulated that we should not require them to guide us further than its boundaries. They would stay outside, they said, and take the news of our death back to camp. They seemed to have no doubt that the demon would 'get us,' and you may be sure our curiosity was greatly excited. "I and four others of the corps of construction engineers resolved to run this mysterious devil to the ground, and so, as soon as we could make the necessary arrangements, started out. We soon entered the jungle, and made steady progress. As far as we could judge we went almost due south. We traveled with hardly a stop other than long enough to eat, that first day, and only stopped when darkness made further progress impossible. "We were up bright and early the next morning, and about noon caught our first glimpse of the ruined city. Way down a clearing in the jungle, we could see tall white pillars, many of them partly hidden by creeping vines. "We all broke into a run, and in an hour or so were on the outskirts of the old city. And believe me, my lads, at one time that had been a city with a capital C! It had evidently been laid out in well ordered streets and squares, and everywhere houses were bordered by the remains of what had been great temples and buildings. Most of them were on the ground, mere heaps of ruins, but a few were still standing, at least in part, and we could get a faint idea of what the old city must have been in those far off days of its prime. At present, though, it seemed to be the abode only of wild things. "We gazed in wonder at this sight for some time, and then held a pow-wow. We had a long discussion as to whether we should start exploring at once, or wait till the next morning. "We finally decided on the latter plan, as, in spite of our blastings about wanting to shake hands with the presiding devil, we really had no great hankering to meet him after dark. Of course, we none of us believed in that 'devil' business, but still we had no doubt that some secret menace hung over the old city. The guides were positive on this point, and as they had been right so far, we were inclined to give their opinions some consideration." Here Mr. Hartley paused as though to gather his thoughts, and the three boys, who had been listening intently to his narrative, drew a deep breath. "My!" exclaimed Tom, "make out we wouldn't like to have been with you then." "Yes, I daresay you would," said Mr. Hartley, with a smile, as he noted the eager longing in the eyes of his listeners. "I think it would have been an adventure after your own heart. But wait till you hear the rest, and you may be glad you were not along." "I doubt it," said Bert, "but go on with the story, if you please, Mr. Hartley." CHAPTER XI THE DESERTED CITY "Well," resumed Mr. Hartley, "we made camp, as that appeared to be the desire of the majority, and turned in, as soon as we had eaten supper. We were all dead tired after the long journey, and I guess none of us were troubled in our sleep by thoughts of the strange spirit of evil that ruled the city, according to the natives. It's a lucky thing, sometimes, that you can't see into the future. If we could have done so that night, our sleep might have been less sound. "We were awakened by the guides, who had already prepared a good breakfast for us, and you may be sure we all ate heartily, both because it tasted good and because we wanted to start out on our exploration in good trim. "The meal despatched, we entered the ruins by what had apparently at one time been a great gate, but which now was nothing but a twisted heap of stone. Evidently the city had been encircled by a wall, but this had crumbled away and was overgrown by the tropical vegetation. "Of course, we had to leave the guides behind us, as they positively refused to pass the boundaries. This didn't cause us much worry, however, for we knew from experience that, when it came to trouble, they were of little use. "The ruins lay before us apparently devoid of any human inhabitants. At first we didn't know which way to go, but finally decided to make straight for what looked to have been the center of the town. As well as we could make out, all the streets seemed to converge toward that point, which had no doubt been the public square. "We followed this plan, but as we went along were often tempted to alter it. More than once we passed some building that seemed in better repair than the others, and of course we wanted to explore it. But we thought it would be no use examining lesser ruins, when greater ones were at hand. For, as we got nearer the center of the town, we could see that the square was occupied by a building much more pretentious than any we had seen so far. From a distance it had looked merely like a jumbled mass of ruins, but when we at last stood before it we could see that such was far from being the case. "To be sure, the building was in a ruinous condition, but, probably owing to its having originally been built in a more solid fashion even than its neighbors, it was in comparatively good preservation. Even the roof appeared intact in places, and we marveled as we gazed at it. Great columns rose tier after tier, interspersed with solid walls of granite, until they supported a roof at least eighty or a hundred feet from the ground. The facade was ornamented profusely with carvings of men and animals, some of them very well done, indeed. "We realized that this building and its fellows must have been the production of some highly developed form of civilization, and many were the speculations as to who the ancient people could have been. "But we soon got tired of looking at the outside, and were all seized with a desire to explore the wonderful place. Its main entrance was little obstructed, and there was nothing to prevent our going in. It was as black as pitch inside, although the sun was shining brightly, and we cast about for same means of lighting the interior. We secured some resinous fagots from a great tree that had sprung up near by, and found that they burned brightly and would serve our purpose perfectly. "Each one of us armed himself with one of these, then, and took another along in reserve. In this fashion we invaded the ancient temple, for such we believed it to be, not without, it must be confessed, a rather chilly feeling in the neighborhood of the spine. At least, I felt that way, and I have no doubt the others did, too. However, we all carried revolvers, and felt confident that if the mysterious 'demon' attacked us, we would be able to give him a sharp argument. "Nevertheless we kept closely together, and were inclined to believe firmly in the old adage that 'in numbers there is strength.' We had no difficulty in climbing over the fallen blocks encumbering the entrance, and soon found ourselves fairly on the inside. The place had a damp, earthy smell, and the air was very close and oppressive. It was black as pitch, too, and the light from our improvised torches did little to dispel the gloom. "However, it would never do to back out now, so we advanced cautiously, stumbling every once in a while over some fallen piece of masonry. Our footsteps rang and echoed under the great vault that we could hardly see, so lofty it was. It seemed almost sacrilege to disturb the silence of this building, that had probably not echoed to human footsteps for centuries. "We kept on, nevertheless, until we were halted suddenly by an exclamation from one of the men in front. "Look, look!" he exclaimed, pointing with a trembling finger. We followed its direction, and I distinctly felt my hair rise on my head. For there, high up near the roof, two green eyes glared down at us with a baleful sparkle! They glinted and glowed, and a gasp went up from our little party. "'By all that's holy, what is it?' whispered Tom Bradhurst, my special friend. "No one answered, but we all got a tight grip on our revolver butts. We gazed, fascinated, at those two lambent points of light, fully expecting to come to hand grips with the 'demon' then and there. As nothing happened, however, we plucked up courage enough to advance cautiously, and were soon near enough to make out the cause of our fright. The eyes were two great emeralds set in the head of a colossal idol carved out of a great block of solid granite! The image must have been at least thirty feet high, and the emeralds were each as large as a robin's egg. "'Great Scott!" ejaculated Bob Winters, another of our party, "that thing has scared me out of ten years of life, and I'm going to have my revenge. I'm going to climb up there and get those emeralds, if it takes a leg. Why, there'll be a fortune in them for all of us." "We tried to dissuade him, for our nerves had been shaken, and we didn't want to monkey with the confounded things. Bob was always a dare-devil chap, though, and set on having his own way. So he went at it, climbing nimbly up the front of the image, until he was in a position to touch the great emeralds. Then he drew his hunting knife and commenced prying away at the stones to dislodge them. "Suddenly he gave the most unearthly shriek it has ever been my lot to hear, threw his hands up over his head, and started sliding down the steep front of the statue. While the shriek yet rang in our ears, a great section of what had appeared to be solid rock flooring at the base of the idol opened inward, and our comrade's body hurtled through the aperture and disappeared from our sight. His hunting knife rattled on the stones at our feet, and then all was silence. "If we had been standing a yard nearer the base of the image the whole party would have been dropped through the hole." At this point Mr. Hartley paused in his narrative, and passed his hand over his eyes. The boys saw that great beads of perspiration covered his forehead, but they had been so absorbed in the story that they had not noticed this before. They waited breathlessly for him to resume, which he did after a few seconds. "Well," he continued, "for a few seconds we were stricken motionless by the suddenness and horror of the thing. Then we gathered ourselves together, and rushed to the edge of the gaping opening. We shouted and called, and at last were answered by a faint moan. Then we looked into each other's eyes, and knew that there was only one thing to do. We must go down into that black hole and do what we could to rescue our friend. "But how were we to accomplish this? We had no ropes, and the feeble light of our torches when we thrust them into the black opening failed to reveal any bottom. For this reason we dared not risk a drop, with almost the certainty of not being able to get back again." "It looked as though we were 'up against it,' but finally we made a makeshift rope by tearing up part of our clothing into strips and tying them together. This made a fairly serviceable rope, and, after tying knots in it at intervals to facilitate our descent, we lowered it into the opening. When we had let it out almost to the end it stopped swinging, so we knew it had touched bottom. I volunteered to go down first, and did so." "It was ticklish business, and more than once I almost lost my hold. Finally, however, my feet touched a hard floor, and I let go." "All right!" I shouted to those above. "Come on down." "Coming, old man," replied 'Brad,' and the sound of his cheery voice was a great comfort to me. I knew he would soon be with me, and so gave my attention to finding and helping Bob. I had not gone more than a few steps when I discovered him stretched out on the cold rock floor, either unconscious or dead. I soon found the former to be the case, to my great relief, and forced a few drops of whiskey from my flask between his teeth. "By the time Bradhurst had reached my side I could see some signs of returning consciousness in Bob's face, and before long he struggled to a sitting posture." "Wh--what happened, anyway?" he asked. "That's what we'd like to know," said Brad. "What made you fall that way. What struck you?" "Something darted out of that cursed thing's mouth and pierced my hand," replied Bob, as he began to regain his memory. "Look at that!" and he held his left hand out for us to see. "It had been neatly punctured by some sharp instrument, which left a small wound not more than an eighth of an inch across. The hand was puffed and swollen, though, and the thought flashed across my mind that this scratch was probably not as trivial as it looked. I had little doubt that the instrument, whatever it was, had been poisoned, and as I stole a swift glance at Brad I could see that the same thought was in his mind. "Bob never seemed to think of this possibility, though, and you may be sure we were careful not to give him an inkling of our anxiety. That would do no good, and our fears might be unfounded. "While we were examining the hand, our companions had descended, and of course Bob had to repeat the cause of the accident to them. "But how do you feel now, old man?" queried Brad, when he had finished. "Oh, nothing extra," replied Bob. "I seem to feel rather dizzy, but I suppose that's the result of the fall. I'm lucky not to have broken my neck." "Well, anyway, it's up to us to get out of this hoodooed place as soon as possible," I told them. "Come along. I'll go up first, then you fellows come, and we'll haul Bob out." "Accordingly I started up our improvised rope hand over hand. I had not ascended more than five or six feet, however, when with a slight r-r-ip the rope parted above my head, and I fell back to the stones below. Fortunately I landed on my feet, and so escaped with nothing worse than a severe shaking up. "But I had small reason to be thankful, nevertheless, for the desperate nature of our position was soon borne in upon me. How to get out--that was the question, and, when I put it up to my companions, they had no answer. "The place in which we were now imprisoned seemed to be a sort of tunnel. It was not more than fifteen feet wide, but we had no means of telling how long it might be. To get out the way we had come was evidently out of the question, as the roof of the tunnel was at least twenty-five feet above our heads. "Well, boys," said Bradhurst, at last, "the only thing we can do is to follow the course of this hole one way or the other, and try to find an outlet. And the sooner we start the better, as our torches aren't going to last much longer." "Here was another horror added to our situation, which had seemed bad enough before. Without light, our chances of escape from the horrible place would be slight indeed, so we acted on our comrade's advice without delay. "There was apparently little choice of direction. Our torches burned steadily, and so we knew there was no breeze coming from either direction that might point to an outlet. Our sense of locality was rather twisted by this time, but after a consultation we set out through the tunnel in what we believed to be the direction of our camp. Before we had gone far, Bob complained of wanting to sleep, and it was all we could do to keep him moving. I walked on one side of him, holding his arm, while Wryburn, another of the party, supported him on the other side. Brad walked in front, carefully scanning the walls of the tunnel for signs of an opening. "After we had gone a considerable distance in this manner, we heard a faint roaring sound, that grew constantly louder as we pushed forward. "It sounds like water," said Wryburn. "We must be coming to a subterranean river." "We had little doubt that this theory was correct, and pressed forward with renewed hope. At any rate, we had the assurance that the tunnel would not end in a blank wall, as we had feared, and so force us to retrace our footsteps. "We were held back badly by Bob, though, who, by now, had become almost helpless. We were forced practically to carry him, and he seemed to have lost consciousness. "All things have an end, however, and at last we stood on the bank of the underground river. It was two or three hundred feet wide, and raced along with a very powerful current. By this time you may be sure we were very thirsty, as well as hungry, and the cold water satisfied one craving if not the other. After we had drunk our fill we set to work dressing Bob's wounded hand as well as we could, which is not saying much. He seemed to be in a sort of coma, from which we were unable to arouse him." "After we had made him as comfortable as possible we discussed plans of escape. I was of the opinion that our best course would be to follow the river in the hope of its emerging into the open at some point. There seemed to be no objection to this from my companions, so after a short rest we started out. First, we improvised a rude stretcher for Bob, and took turns carrying it." "At the spot where we had first come upon it, the river was edged with a little strip of coarse gravel, but, as we progressed, this became narrower and narrower, and the river seemed to be running with even greater velocity than before. At last the strip of beach disappeared altogether, and we had no choice but to enter the water. We splashed along wearily, and hope burned lower and lower in our breasts. To add to our troubles, our stock of torches was almost exhausted, and we were forced to burn only one at a time, to make them last longer. "The walls between which the stream now ran got closer and closer together, with the result that the water became deeper and rushed along with greater force. The sound of its roaring in the confined place was deafening, and communication with each other was out of the question. "We had traveled perhaps three miles in this manner, when we suddenly noticed that the water seemed to be rising! Within a few minutes after we had observed this, it crept up to above our knees, and its roaring grew perceptibly louder. We looked desperately about us for some place of refuge, but there was none. The stream now ran in a cavern not more than eighty feet wide and ten feet high, and its smooth, water-worn walls stretched on into the darkness ahead without a break. "We looked at each other in dismay, as the water crept up, deeper and deeper. Pieces of wood and branches of trees were now floating on it, and Bradhurst said, 'Boys, there must be a heavy rain outside, and this stream is feeling its effects. If we don't get to some place where it widens out very soon, we might as well write each other's epitaphs. We've got to hurry like--listen! What was that?'" "From the blackness in back of us came a sudden loud, menacing roar, growing in volume every second." "Come on, boys, quick!" yelled Bradhurst, setting us the example by forging ahead faster than before. "There's a big wave coming that'll fill this place up to the roof, and the Lord help us if it overtakes us here." "We stumbled along as fast as we could, but could make but slow progress, burdened as we were by the helpless form of our comrade. The water was almost to our waists, and the awful wave back of us approached with horrible rapidity. We were about ready to give up, when Bradhurst, who was a little in the lead, came ploughing back to us. "Come along for your lives, boys," he shouted above the noise of the water. "This infernal hole widens out a little further on, and if--here, you fellows are tired out. Hustle along, and I'll carry Bob." "We tried to stop him, but he paid no attention to us, and, stooping over, lifted the unconscious form of our companion on his broad back. Thus relieved, we put all our ebbing strength in one last mad dash, pulling Brad and his burden along with us. At last we reached a place where the cavern widened, and struggled up on a strip of sandy beach. But we were not out of the water's power yet, by any means. We knew that our only salvation lay in finding some refuge above the highest level the stream would be likely to reach, and so began a frantic hunt along the walls of the cavern. "By the greatest good fortune, my eye caught sight of a rocky projection, quite a way up the side of the cave, and I yelled to my companions. They hurried over, and we climbed desperately up the rocky wall. I was the first to reach the platform, and I helped the others over its edge. Bradhurst waited until we were all up, and then hoisted Bob up over his head. I leaned over as far as I could, and was just able to get a grip on the unconscious man. Assisted by the others, I pulled him up, and then in a twinkling we had Brad up, too. "And not a second too soon, either. Even as we hauled our friend over the edge, a great foaming wall of water leaped out of the tunnel from which we had emerged not three minutes before, and boiled out over the floor of the cave in which we were. It washed against the walls, and we thought for a few seconds that it would even reach our place of refuge. It did lap up to within a foot of us, but then spread out more and subsided a little. "We would have been as helpless as so many chips of wood if it had caught us while in the narrow tunnel, and we shuddered as we thought of our narrow escape. "The ledge on which we found ourselves was amply supplied with driftwood, probably left there at the time of some former flood that had been even fiercer than this one. We made a fire, and waited for the water to subside with as much patience as we could muster. We knew that Bob would probably die unless we could get him to a doctor soon, and this made the waiting all the harder. At times he would rave in delirium, and at others lie so quiet that more than once we thought him dead. "But the water did go down after what seemed to us an age, but was in all probability not more than a few hours. We resumed our journey down its channel, and by great good fortune came at last to the place where it emerged into the open air. The sun was shining brightly, and words are inadequate to describe our joy at seeing it once more. We took deep breaths of the warm tropical air, so grateful after the damp, confined atmosphere in which we had been so long, and thanked a kind Providence for our escape. "We made our way back to our camp, and arrived just in the nick of time. Our guides had given us up as lost, and were much astonished at seeing us. After their first astonishment had worn off, they seemed to regard us with the greatest respect, which we were at a loss to account for at the time. We later found out that it was because we had been able to cheat the inexorable 'devil,' supposed to rule the old city, of his prey. "We returned to camp by forced marches, and turned Bob over to the camp physician. He recovered at last, all but his hand, which never regained its power. The natives said it was the 'demon's curse,' and possibly they were right. "At the time nothing could have hired us to go back to the old ruins, but lately I've had a sneaking desire to go back and finish exploring that old temple. Perhaps I shall, some day, and likely as not the devil will get me, this time. Who knows?" Mr. Hartley ended his strange narrative with a smile, half serious, half comical, and his listeners drew a long breath. They voted it one of the most exciting tales they had ever heard, and besieged the engineer with questions as to the location of the ruined city. But Mr. Hartley only shook his head. "No, no," he said, and, although he smiled, his tone was serious. "It would be just like you madcaps to undertake a journey there, and I don't want to be the cause of your death. If you don't mind, I'd rather not tell you." Although disappointed, the boys did not press the matter, and after a little further discussion of the engineer's story, took their departure. "Just the same," declared Bert, on their way home, "I'd like nothing better than for us three to tackle that 'devil.' I have an idea we could stand him on his head." "I'd like to try it, anyway," declared Tom, and Dick declared himself as feeling the same way. They talked about little else that evening, and if, after they were asleep, they were troubled by nightmares, the cause was not hard to determine. CHAPTER XII WAH LEE'S BOSS The next few days were crowded with incident. The city was filling up with visitors, to be present at the ceremonies attending the opening of the Canal. Many of these were celebrities known all over the world. Soldiers, admirals, diplomats, men of affairs, brushed shoulders with thousands less famous, but quite as interested in the great event so soon to take place. The boys were constantly meeting someone whom they had known in the "States"; and, in the renewal of old friendships and the making of new ones, the time flew by as though on wings. But, underneath all the hubbub and excitement, Bert was conscious of an uneasy premonition. He tried to analyze it, and, when unsuccessful in this, attempted to throw it off. Despite all his efforts, however, it persisted. Call it clairvoyance, call it telepathy, he felt aware of impending danger. Some "coming event" was casting "its shadow before." Again and again the words of Allison recurred to him. Not that he believed in them. Although they had stirred him at the time with a sense of vague foreboding, he had dismissed them as the utterance of an enthusiast, who felt a deep antipathy toward the Japanese, and magnified the danger to be feared from them. Of course, it was absurd--that last remark of his that at that very moment a Japanese fleet might be on its way to attack the Pacific Slope. He laughed as he thought of it, but, somehow, the laugh did not ring true. Wah Lee had kept his word, and frequently called to see his friends. But his serenity seemed to be disturbed. He appeared troubled and distrait. At times, he acted as though he were about to tell them something, but was himself in doubt as to the value of his information, and restrained himself. His all-embracing smile was conspicuous by its absence. "What's bothering the old chap, I wonder," ruminated Tom. "Search me," laughed Dick. "Something on his conscience, maybe. Perhaps he hasn't burned as many joss sticks before his particular idol as he feels he ought, and the failure worries him." "I'm going to get right down to brass tacks, the next time he comes," said Bert, "and get it out of him." But the wily Celestial baffled all efforts to "pump" him, and the matter passed from their minds. Two days later, however, Wah Lee shuffled past Bert, as the latter was sauntering down the main street of Colon, and, apparently by accident, touched his arm in passing. Bert looked up, and, recognizing the Chinaman, started to speak to him. But the latter only gave him a swift glance from his almond eyes, and kept on, his face as stolid and inscrutable as that of a graven image. In that fleeting look, however, Bert's quick perception recognized that Wah Lee had some object in view, and wanted to talk with him. With a heightened pulse, but still retaining an indifferent air, he followed. At the first turning, the Chinaman passed into a side street, Bert keeping a little way in the rear. The houses grew more infrequent and soon they came to the suburbs. Still on they went, until, at last, they were in the open country, and free from observation. Then, in a remote spot, where they could see for a long distance on every side, Wah Lee stood still, and Bert ranged alongside. "Well, Wah Lee," he asked, curiously, "what's the game?" In answer, the Chinaman drew from his pocket a crumpled sheet of paper, and handed it to Bert. He took it and smoothed it out. At first, it failed to convey any impression. The drawing was a rough one, and seemed to consist of a series of lines, punctured with dots. But gradually, as Bert gazed, his training in mechanics told him that it was a plan of some large structure. There were two rectangular outlines, that were perfectly similar, like two leaves of a table. No, they were gates. And then, like a flash, it came across him. They were the gates of the Gatun Locks! There was the wavy line, to indicate the water level, and, down below these, were the ominous dots. They seemed to be meant for holes, but his knowledge of the locks told him that they had no place in its structure. What did those holes mean? A little shaken, he looked at Wah Lee for the key to the enigma. "Where did you get this?" he asked. "Found it," answered the Chinaman. "Man drop it. Man come to see my bloss. My bloss kill clanal," Wah Lee repeated. For a moment, Bert's head swam, and a thousand bells seemed to ring in his ears. Then he steadied himself, and plied the Chinaman with eager questions that sought to pluck the heart out of the mystery. Wah Lee's knowledge of English was very limited, and it took a long time and infinite patience to get from him what he knew. Gradually, he pieced the bits together, until the whole thing became clear and coherent in his mind. By the merest accident, Wah Lee had heard enough to know that the Japanese who employed him was engaged in a plot to destroy the Canal. How or when it was to be done, he did not know. It was doubtful if he could have grasped the details, even if he had heard them, so full they were of technical matters that conveyed to him no meaning. But he knew that the plot existed, and dimly understood that this would bring pain and suffering to Bert. As far as he himself was concerned, a dozen canals might be destroyed, without affecting him in the least. But he held the boys in strong affection for having saved his life, and he knew that he could pay his debt, at least in part, by letting them know what was brewing. As regarded the paper, Wah Lee knew nothing, except that a white man, who spoke English, was a frequent visitor to his master, with whom he held long conferences. Only yesterday, on leaving the house after dark, he had accidentally dropped the plan, and Wah Lee, hovering near, had picked it up. A vague idea that it might be of value to Bert and prompted him to bring it to him. This was the sum of the Chinaman's knowledge. He simply knew that his "bloss" was engaged in some kind of a plan to kill the Canal. But Bert must know more than this--the nature of the plan, the people involved in it, the methods employed for it, the time set for its execution. Then, only, could the proper steps be taken to thwart it. How could this knowledge be obtained? Not by Wah Lee. He had accidentally stumbled upon it, and while this, of course, was an inestimable service, abler minds than his must unravel the details. Whatever was to be done must be done quickly. Time was a factor of prime importance. Bert looked up at the sky. The sun was near its setting. Night would come on suddenly. With the rapid resolution that was one of his chief characteristics, Bert made up his mind. "Make tracks for home, Wah Lee," he said. "I'm coming with you." The Chinaman made no demur and expressed no surprise. He led the way and Bert followed, racking his brain for the best thing to do. His plans took shape quickly. By the time they drew near the grounds, darkness had enveloped them like a blanket. He halted the Chinaman and talked to him in whispers. He must get into the house, without being seen. Where did the talks with the white man take place? In the library. Very well. Was there any place where he, Bert, could be concealed and hear what went on? But here the Oriental departed from his wonted calm. There was too much risk. Bert would be killed. His master had men in the house who obeyed him absolutely. If he merely lifted his finger, they would kill one man or twenty men. But Bert was not to be deterred from his purpose. He had embarked on this venture, and, live or die, he would see it through to a finish. He cut short the protestations of the frightened Celestial and commanded him to show him the nearest way to the library. There was no way, Wah Lee averred. The house swarmed with servants, and detection would be certain. Every window and every room in the mansion was ablaze with light. Unless he could make himself invisible, the attempt was hopeless. Circling about the house, in the shadow of the shrubbery, Bert studied the location of the room that the Chinaman had pointed out as the library. It was on the second floor, and a broad veranda surrounded the house, about two feet beneath the window. Near by, a giant tree upreared its branches. With a parting word of caution, Bert shied up the tree with the agility of a cat. He ensconced himself firmly on a projecting branch, and peered through the heavy foliage. The room into which he looked was a spacious one and furnished with all the sumptuousness of Eastern luxury. Exquisite tapestries draped the walls, and priceless jades and porcelains bespoke the taste as well as the wealth of the owner. Quaint weapons and suits of armor, doubtless worn at some time by a shogun or samurai ancestor gave a touch of grimness to a beauty and delicacy of ornament that might otherwise have been excessive. At a magnificent library table of ebony, inlaid with pearl, a man was seated with his head on his hand, in an attitude of profound thought. His left hand, playing with the ivory handle of a dagger that lay on the desk, betrayed a certain restlessness, as though he were waiting for someone. From time to time he raised his head, as if listening. At last he threw himself back in his chair with a gesture of impatience, and, with unseeing eyes, looked out of the window. And now, Bert, from his leafy covert, could study his face at leisure. It was a typical Japanese face, with the high cheekbones and slanting eyes that marked his race. But nothing could hide the proofs of breeding and culture that were revealed in every feature. It was the face of a statesman, a scholar, a warrior, a prince. The habit of command was stamped upon it, and in his eyes glowed a spirit of resolution that almost reached fanaticism. Bert felt instinctively that here was a foeman worthy of any man's steel, a formidable enemy who would sweep away like chaff anything that stood between him and the accomplishment of his purpose. Once or twice, Bert had seen him in Colon, a notable figure even in a town at that time filled with notables. No one seemed to know much about him. Three years ago, he had appeared in Panama and purchased a large landed estate. He had spent enormous sums in developing it, until it had become famous throughout the Isthmus for its extent and beauty. That the owner was fabulously wealthy could not be doubted. But beyond this, all was conjecture. He had no official position or diplomatic mission. No breath of suspicion had ever been attached to him of being in any sense hostile to American interests. His suavity, his courtesy, his unquestioned wealth and standing had won for him universal respect. And yet, if Bert's suspicions proved true, the accomplished Japanese gentleman into whose eyes he was looking, was the most dangerous foe that America had in the whole wide world. A door opened and another Japanese entered the room. He was older than the man seated at the desk, and his face was creased with the deep lines of wisdom and long experience. He might have been, and probably was, one of the "elder statesmen"--that august body, that, at home and abroad, guided the destinies of the nation. He saluted ceremoniously the owner of the house, and they were soon engaged in an animated conversation. Then a man of a different type was ushered in by an obsequious servant. He was dressed in American fashion, but his face indicated a Spanish origin. He was a Cuban who had been educated as a civil engineer in one of the scientific schools of the United States. His features were alert and intelligent, but there was a certain shiftiness in his eyes, and something about him gave an indefinable air of dissipation. He had been employed for a time in harbor work at Vera Cruz, but had killed a man in a brawl and been forced to flee the country. On the Canal, there were eighty-seven distinct nationalities engaged in the work, and, in view of the great demand for labor, he had no difficulty in securing employment, the more easily as he was an expert in his profession. He had been assigned to the Gatun section of the work, with his quarters in the city of Colon. The Japanese secret service, in its search for a suitable tool, had become possessed of the facts regarding the murder for which the man, Ofirio, by name, was wanted by the Mexican authorities. With infinite caution and by slow degrees, they had approached and sounded him. They appealed to his fears and his avarice. As regards the first, they could betray him to his pursuers. For the second, they promised him an amount of money greater than he could expect to earn in the course of his natural life, and a safe refuge in Japan. Under the stress of these two primal emotions, he had yielded, and, for a year past, had been in the power and the pay of Namoto, the Japanese, in whose library he was at that moment standing. He it was who had dropped the paper that Wah Lee had so fortunately retrieved and which had given Bert the first hint of the appalling disaster that threatened his country. Bert noticed the subtle something in the air of Namoto--a mixture of power, disdain, and condescension--as he motioned the engineer to a seat. From a stray word or two that came to him, he noted that they were talking in English, which both understood, while neither could speak the native language of the other. And now it became imperative that Bert should hear the conference that concerned him so tremendously. From where he was, he could see perfectly, but could hear nothing but an occasional disconnected word. He must leave his safe retreat, take his life in his hands and reach the veranda that ran beneath the open window. Silently, he removed his shoes, and, tying them together by the laces, hung them over the branch. Then he crept out on the heavy bough that reached within three feet hope there ain't any hosses been stole since we went away," said Bradley, jocosely. "Ben and I ain't quite ready to hand in our checks." "We wouldn't hold you responsible if there had been," was the reply. "That makes me feel a little easier in mind," said Bradley. "It may be pleasant to hang from a branch with a noose round your neck, but I don't want to try it." The miners were just preparing to take their evening meal, and Ben and his friend were invited to share their hospitality. After supper pipes were produced, and Bradley was called upon to bring forth his budget of news. In the little mining-settlement, far from the great world, a man who could give the latest news from the city or produce a late paper from any of the Eastern cities was hailed as a public benefactor. So it was at an unusually late hour that our friends and the miners retired to rest. The next morning the two new-comers were shown the claims which had been set aside for them. They were eligibly located, and already had a commercial value, but were bestowed out of good-will, without a cent of compensation. Bradley and Ben got to work at once. They had had their vacation, and were ready to settle down to business. They were stimulated to effort by the success of some of their fellow miners. Ben's next neighbor had already gathered nearly three thousand dollars' worth of gold-dust, and it was quite within the limits of probability that our young hero might be as successful. "If I fail it won't be for lack of trying," thought Ben. Three thousand dollars, in addition to the thousand he already had, would make him feel rich. Some of my readers, who have been luxuriously reared, will be surprised to hear this. But Ben had always been used to small things. He had been brought up in a small country town, where a dollar counts for a good deal more than it does in the city, and where a man possessing ten thousand dollars is thought to be independently rich. His uncle Job, who was thrifty and industrious, and generally, through careful economy, had a little money in the savings bank, was probably worth, at the outside, fifteen hundred dollars. No wonder, then, that the prospect of being worth four thousand dollars dazzled our young hero and stimulated him to unwonted effort. Neither of our two friends got on fast. They averaged perhaps fifty dollars a week each, but out of this their expenses had to be paid, and these, on account of the high price of all articles of necessity, were rather heavy. Still, the end of each week found both richer, and they were contented. It was the aim of every miner to "strike it rich." Each had a dream of some day cutting a rich vein or finding a nugget of extraordinary size which should compress into one day the profits of a year or two of ordinary success. But such lucky finds were not numerous. As in ordinary life, the large prizes are rare, and average success is the rule. But the general hope was kept up by occasional lucky strokes. "Ben," said Bradley, one day in excitement, returning from a visit to the claims half a mile distant on the other side of a hilly ridge, "I've got great news." "What is it, Jake?" "Perkins has just found a nugget that must contain five hundred dollars' worth of gold." "You don't say so, Jake?" "Fact; I just saw it." "I hope there's more of them 'round here." "So do I. That's a find worth having." The discovery made a sensation at Golden Gulch. It excited the hope of all, and stimulated labor. What had fallen to Perkins might chance to any one of his comrades. So, as the miners sat round their roaring fire--for it was getting chilly in the evening--one and another discussed the interesting question, "What would I do if I could find a nugget?" Various, of course, were the answers. One would go home and start a dry-goods store (he had been a dry-goods clerk in Philadelphia); another would buy the old Stuart place and get married; another would pay off a mortgage on the old homestead, and so on. "What would you do, Ben?" asked Bradley. "I would go home by the next steamer, and buy Uncle Job the three-acre lot he has been wanting so long, and buy new dresses for aunt and Jennie. But it isn't much use forming plans till the nugget is found." "That's so, Ben; but you are as likely to find it as the next man." "I will hope for it, at any rate." Though Ben's prospects were excellent, and he had met with unusual success, his thoughts often wandered back to the quiet village where the years of his boyhood had been chiefly passed. From time to time he was disturbed by the thought that something might have happened to his uncle's family, of whom he had heard little or nothing since he went away. He afterward learned that letters had been sent which he had not received. He was not exactly homesick, but he felt keenly the lack of news from home. In spite of this, however, he worked on with energy and industry. He felt that every dollar he earned brought nearer the day when he would feel justified in turning his back upon the gold-fields of California and wending his homeward way to Hampton. Meanwhile, Ben did not neglect to do what he could for the general entertainment. It has already been mentioned that he could sing very creditably, and his talent was very often called into requisition in the evening. Ben was obliging, and, finding he could give pleasure, he generally complied with the request of the miners and rehearsed such songs as he knew, so that he was considered a decided acquisition by the little company, and his popularity was unbounded. "I've been thinkin', Ben," said Bradley, one Sunday when they were taking a walk together, "that if there was any offices to be filled you'd stand a good show of bein' elected." "What makes you think so, Jake?" "You're the most popular man in the camp--leastways, boy." "I can easily believe that, Jake, as I am the only boy." "Well, there's no one ahead of you, man or boy." "I am glad if that is so," said Ben, modestly. "It is chiefly because I am a boy." "Boys are not always popular. It depends a good deal on the kind of boy." So the reader will get some idea of Ben's life at the mines and the estimation in which he was held by his comrades. It was not very exciting nor very eventful, but there was to be a change. One day his pick struck something hard. It might be a rock which would need to be removed. He dug round it patiently, but when he wished to lift it after it was loosened, he found it necessary to summon Bradley to his assistance. "Why, Ben!" exclaimed Bradley, in excitement, "this isn't a rock; it is a nugget, and a bouncer." "'A nugget'!" repeated Ben, incredulously. "Yes; look here!" and Bradley pointed out the indubitable signs of its value. "Yes, Ben, your fortune has come at last." "How much is it worth?" demanded Ben, almost breathless with excitement and exhilaration. "How much? Three thousand dollars at least." "Then I can go home." "Yes, Ben, you're got your pile." It may as well be stated here that Bradley's guess was not far out of the way. The nugget, when it reached San Francisco, was found to amount to three thousand seven hundred dollars. To the credit of the miners of Golden Gulch, it must be said that all rejoiced in Ben's success. No one's good luck would have excited so little envy or jealousy as that of the boy who had worked by their side for months, and done so much by his good-humor and musical gifts to cheer up and entertain them. When he was ready to start for the city on his homeward journey all joined in wishing him a pleasant journey and the best of luck in the years to come. Ben was not obliged to travel alone. Bradley decided not only to accompany him to San Francisco, but to sail to New York in his company. "I've never seen York," he said, "and I never shall see it if I don't go now. So, if you don't mind, Ben, I'll go along with you." "Mind, Jake? There's nothing I shall like better." While they are on the steamer homeward bound events have transpired in Ben's old home which require to be noted. CHAPTER XXXI. JOB STANTON'S MISTAKE. There had not been many changes in the little town of Hampton since Ben left it. It was one of those quiet New England villages where life moves slowly, and a death or a marriage is an event. Uncle Job still lived in his plain little cottage with his wife and daughter, and still plied his humble task as the village cobbler, essaying sometimes to make shoes when there were none to be repaired. There was a plat of land belonging to his house rather more than an acre in extent, but land was cheap in Hampton, and it is doubtful whether both house and lot would have brought, if thrown into the market, over one thousand dollars. Uncle Job had at one time about a hundred dollars in the savings bank in a neighboring town--a fund to draw from in an emergency--and this money with his plain home constituted his entire wealth. Eleven hundred dollars all told! It was not a very brilliant result for forty years' labor, beginning with the days of his boyhood; but Job Stanton was not ambitious, and he actually felt well-to-do. He earned enough to supply the simple wants of his family, and had something over, and this satisfied him. But one day a strong temptation came to Job Stanton, and he yielded to it. A trader came riding over from a neighboring town and called on Uncle Job. The good man thought he had come to order a new pair of shoes, and felt flattered that such a dashing man should have gone so far out of his way to patronize him. "I'm glad to see you, Mr. Richmond," he said. "Won't you set down?" He should have said _sit_, but Job Stanton's educational advantages had been very limited. "I don't care if I do. Snug place you've got here, Mr. Stanton." "It's very plain and humble, but it's home, and I set by it," answered Job, who was busily engaged in tapping a shoe belonging to Eliphalet Nourza, a farm-laborer. "I've come over to see you on a little business, Mr. Stanton," said the trader, affably. "Jest so!" returned Uncle Job cheerfully, glancing over his spectacles at the trader's shoes to see if they looked much worn. "Want a pair of new shoes, I reckon?" "I shall need a new pair soon," said Richmond, "but that isn't exactly what I meant." It flashed across Job Stanton's mind that his visitor might be going to make him an offer for the old place, but he felt that he could not bear to part with it. He had lived there ever since he was married, thirty-five years ago, and there Jennie, the child of his old age, had been born. But the trader's next sentence relieved him of this thought. "The fact is, Uncle Job," proceeded the trader, adopting the title by which the shoemaker was generally known in Hampton, "I've got a favor to ask of you." "'A favor to ask of me'?" repeated Job, looking up with some surprise at the well-dressed merchant, who seemed by his presence to honor the homely little shop. "Yes," continued Richmond, with gravity; "I want you to indorse my note for five hundred dollars." "What made you come to me?" asked Job Stanton in surprise. "I am not a capitalist; I am a poor man." "Oh, well, you're good for five hundred dollars." "Yes," answered Job with some complacency; "my place here is worth twice that, let alone the money I've got in the savings bank." "Of course it is." "Still, I don't want to run no risk. You'd better go to some moneyed man--like Major Sturgis, for instance." "Why, the fact is, Uncle Job, it's the major that lets me have the money on my note, but he stipulated that I should have an indorser, and he particularly mentioned you." "That's cur'us!" said Job. "Why should he think of me?" "Oh, he knew you were a reliable man." "How does it happen that you need money?" asked Job, bluntly. "Isn't your business good?" "That's just it," said Richmond, glibly. "It's so good that I've got to extend my stock, and that takes money. I'm turning money over all the time, and it won't be long before I am able to retire." "I'm glad of that, but I don't quite understand, if that's so, why you're short of funds." "It's clear you are not a business-man," said Richmond, laughing, "but I think I can explain to you how it is." He did explain, and the explanation seemed very plausible, yet Job Stanton, who was a cautious man, hesitated. This brought the trader to his closing argument: "You mustn't think, Uncle Job, that I expect this service for nothing. I am ready to pay you ten dollars for the accommodation, and to order a pair of shoes at your own price." "That's handsome!" said Job; "and all I've got to do is to sign my name?" "Just so. It's a mere formality. I shall have the money to pay the note twice over before it comes due." "Then I wonder the major wants an indorser." "Oh, it's his invariable custom. 'I know it isn't necessary, Mr. Richmond,' he told me, 'but it's my rule, and I won't break over it, even in your case. If you will get Job Stanton to indorse for you, it will be perfectly satisfactory. I know he is a poor man, but then it's only a form.'" "Well, I don't know," said Job, doubtfully. "If Ben was here I would ask him." "You mean your nephew, don't you?" "Yes, the boy that went to California." "I'm glad you mentioned him. As soon as he gets back send him to me and I'll give him a place in my store. I've heard he's very smart." "So he is," said Job, "and I'd like to have him with you, so that he could come to see us once in a while. There ain't no openin' in Hampton." "Of course not." "And you'll give Ben a place when he gets home?" "Certainly; that is, if you indorse my note. I am ready to pay you the ten dollars down." He drew a crisp bank-note for ten dollars from his pocket, and Job Stanton yielded, for it was a great deal of money to him. I think, however, that he was more influenced by the prospect of obtaining a good place for Ben that would keep him from wandering farther away from home. If he had been shrewder, it would have occurred to him that a prosperous business-man, such as Richmond claimed to be, was unusually anxious for a small accommodation. However, to him five hundred dollars represented a large sum, and it didn't seem at all strange. So Uncle Job took off his leather apron, ushered his visitor into the sitting-room, and sitting down at the table indorsed the note. "Thank you," said Richmond. "Here is the ten." "I don't know as I ought to ask you so much," said Job, with conscientious scruples. "Oh, that's all right. Now, I'll go into the shop, and you may take my measure for a pair of shoes." "This has been a lucky day for me," thought Job Stanton. "I've got ten dollars for writing my name, and it isn't often I earn as much as that in a week." The trader seemed equally pleased, and the two parted in mutual good spirits. The note was for three months, or ninety days, and Job Stanton thought no more about it. Why should he? Richmond had expressly told him that it was a mere form, and he supposed that this was the case. The ten dollars went to buy new dresses--not very expensive, of course--for his wife and Jennie, and that seemed to be the end of it. But Job was destined to be undeceived, and that very rudely. One day he was surprised by a call from his dignified fellow-townsman, Major Sturgis. "Good-morning, Mr. Stanton," said the major, condescendingly. "Good-morning, major. I hope your family are quite well." "Quite well, I thank you." "What's he come about?" thought Job, wonderingly. "You indorsed a note for Richmond, the dry-goods man, three months since." "So I did. Is it really three months?" "Close upon it, Mr. Stanton. I regret to say that I shall be obliged to call upon you to pay it." "Me! to pay it!" ejaculated Uncle Job, thunderstruck. "Why, I only indorsed it." "Precisely. That means that you are to pay it if Richmond doesn't." "But he will pay it," said the poor shoemaker, eagerly. "He said it was only a matter of form." "Then he deceived you. I have just received a note from him telling me to look to you." CHAPTER XXXII. THE HOUSE IS MORTGAGED. Job Stanton would not have been more utterly overwhelmed if he had seen his treasured home reduced to ashes before his eyes. That he should be responsible for a debt of five hundred dollars seemed to him almost incredible. The trader's representation that indorsing the note was only a matter of form he had accepted as strictly true. "Well, what are you going to do about it?" asked the major, impatiently. "'Goin' to do about it'?" ejaculated Job. "Certainly. When a man indorses a note he knows that he may be called upon to pay, and of course has some plan for doing it." "I don't know what to do," said the poor shoemaker, sadly. "I can't pay the note." "Humph! There seems to be only one thing to do, then." "What is it?" "You must sell or mortgage your place." "What! sell or mortgage my house? I can't do that, Major Sturgis." "Very well. I won't insist on it if you can pay the note in any other way." "Heaven knows I can't." "Then, Mr. Stanton," said the major, sharply, "it's time to speak plainly. Unless you do as I suggest, I shall attach your property and compel you to raise the money in the way I indicate." Job Stanton was mortally afraid of legal proceedings, and after a while he acceded to the major's proposal, which was himself to accept a mortgage for the sum of five hundred dollars secured upon the place. His wife, who had to be told, wept bitterly, for it seemed to her as if they were parting with their main reliance. But Major Sturgis carried his point, and walked off triumphant. And now for the major's motive, for he had one, and he had artfully made use of Richmond to forward his plan: He was desirous of getting possession of the poor shoemaker's house and land, having in view the purchase of the lot adjoining. Then he would move the house off, throw down the fence between the two lots, build a nice dwelling, and rent it to a city friend who wished to spend his summers in Hampton. He knew very well that Job Stanton wouldn't listen to a proposition for selling his house, and he therefore tried to accomplish by stratagem what he could not fairly. "Pa, you are looking in good spirits," said Sam Sturgis when his father came home. "I don't feel so," said the major, hypocritically. "I have had to do a very disagreeable thing this morning." "What was it?" Sam asked, his curiosity being excited. "Mr. Richmond the trader owed me a note for five hundred dollars, indorsed by Job Stanton, and as he did not pay it, I had to call on Stanton." "He couldn't pay--he's too poor," said Sam. "Not in money, but he owns his place. I have accepted a mortgage for six months' time on his house and lot." "Suppose he doesn't pay when the time comes?" "I am afraid I shall have to foreclose the mortgage." "And he'll have to leave, won't he?" "Unless he can raise the money some other way." "There isn't any other way, is there?" "Richmond might hand over the money by that time." "Do you think he will?" "He ought to, but I don't think there is much chance of it." "Ben will be rather astonished when he comes home and finds his uncle has lost his place." "Yes, I suppose he will." "I sha'n't be sorry for him. He puts on a good many airs, considering how poor he is. I wish I knew how he is getting along in California." "He may get a living there, but that is about all," said the major. "I shouldn't be at all surprised if his uncle came to me for money to get him home." "You wouldn't let him have it, would you, pa?" "I might," answered Major Sturgis, "if he would surrender the place to me without putting me to inconvenience." "Would you take Ben for my servant, pa, in that case?" "Why do you want him for a servant?" "I want to humble his pride," answered Sam, with a gleam of something like hatred in his eyes. CHAPTER XXXIII. THE BLOW ABOUT TO FALL All this happened soon after Ben went away. His uncle did not write him of it, for he knew it would trouble the boy, and it could do no good. "No, wife," he said; "Ben will have a hard row of his own to hoe. He mustn't have any part nor lot in our troubles." "It's very hard, Job, at our time of life," said Mrs. Stanton, despondently. "So it is, wife, but it may turn out for the best, after all. I haven't given up hope that Mr. Richmond will pay the sum, so that I can take up the mortgage. I'm goin' to see him about it to-morrow." Uncle Job left his work the next day, and walked five miles to the store of the man who had brought this calamity upon him. "I've come to see you, Mr. Richmond," he said, wiping his forehead with his red cotton handkerchief, "about that money I've had to pay." "Oh yes," said Richmond, with his usual suavity. "I'm very sorry it happened so." "It seems to me you didn't treat me just right," said poor Job. "Such things will happen, you know, Mr. Stanton." "But you said it was only a matter of form signin' the note?" "Of course I so regarded it. I could have sworn I should be ready to pay when the note became due. You see, there was money owing to me that I couldn't collect." "Didn't you know that was likely to happen when you tempted me to indorse the note?" "It wasn't likely to happen, but it was possible. My plans miscarried, as any man's are liable to. If you were more used to business, Uncle Job, you'd see that I hadn't acted wrong in the matter." "I don't understand the ways of business men, but I know you've done me a grievous wrong, John Richmond," said Job Stanton, gravely. "I've come to ask if you can pay me back a part of that money." "Well, I can't do it this morning. I've got two payments to make. You don't look at it in the right light, Uncle Job." "I want my money," said the old man. "When can you give it to me?" "Since you push me so hard, I can only say I don't know," said Richmond, dropping his soft tones and looking angry. "Is that all the satisfaction you are goin' to give me? Don't you ever mean to pay me that money you've made me pay out on your account, mortgaging my house and risking my home?" "Of course I shall pay you some time, but I can't say exactly when," said the trader, brusquely. "Will you sign a note for the money at three months or six months, John Richmond?" "No, I won't. You'll have to wait, Uncle Job, till I get ready to pay you; that's all about it. I may be ready next week, or it may not be till next month. A business-man can't always foresee how he'll be situated at any definite time." With this poor consolation Job Stanton had to rest content. He looked around him and saw every evidence of prosperity. Several customers were in the store, and the two clerks seemed to have as much as they could do. He saw money paid over for purchases in considerable amounts, and he felt that a part of it might be spared as a partial payment to him; but it was of no avail, and he turned sadly away. The next week passed, and the next month passed, and Job Stanton waited vainly for a payment on account from John Richmond. He didn't like to judge the trader harshly, but it did seem as if he was quite indifferent in the matter. Another month passed, and Job made another visit to the store of his prosperous debtor. Richmond wasted few words on him. "Uncle Job," he said, "it's no use your coming over here. I'll send you the money when I can spare it." Finally, six months passed, the mortgage became due, and Job received a notice from Major Sturgis that he wanted his money. "If you can't raise it," said the major, "I am willing to cancel the note, give you two hundred and fifty dollars, and take a deed of the place." "That is only allowing seven hundred and fifty dollars for it," said poor Job. "It's all it is worth," said the rich man, coldly. "If you prefer to put it up at auction, I am willing, but you may in that case get less. I'll give you three days to decide." There was great sorrow in Job Stanton's house that evening. Six months before he had considered himself well-to-do. Now, at the age of sixty, poverty and destitution stared him in the face. CHAPTER XXXIV. CONCLUSION. "Do you think we shall have to give up the house, Job?" asked Mrs. Stanton, anxiously. "I see no other way," said Job, mournfully. "I can't raise five hundred dollars anywhere." "Have you been to Deacon Pitkin?" "Yes, but the deacon says he's just put out what money he had, and can't accommodate me." "It's hard!" said Mrs. Stanton, with sad brevity. "Yes, it is hard!" assented Job. "I did hope the Lord would show us a way of deliverance, but it seems likely that the sorrow must come upon us." "How meanly Major Sturgis and that man Richmond have behaved! I can't help feeling that they will be come up with sooner or later," said Mrs. Stanton, who, mild as she generally was, could not help feeling exasperated. "I do think they've been inconsiderate," Job admitted. "'Inconsiderate'! Their conduct has been contemptible. The major don't need the money. He could just as well let us stay here." While this conversation was going on Ben and his friend Bradley were approaching the little cottage. Full of joyful memories, Ben lifted the latch and walked into the presence of his uncle and aunt. Nothing but his return could have chased the mournful expression from their faces. "Why, it's Ben come back!" exclaimed his aunt, joyfully. "Well, I declare, so it is!" answered Job Stanton, hurrying forward and grasping the hand of his boy after his aunt had embraced him. "How you've grown, Ben!" said his aunt, admiringly. "Yes, Aunt Clarissa, I've grown four inches," said Ben, proudly. "But I've brought a friend with me.--Jake, come in." And then Bradley was introduced to Job and his wife, and was cordially welcomed by both. "You're lucky to come while we've got a home to welcome you to," said Job, his face again saddening. "Why, Uncle Job, you're not thinking of selling the house, are you?" Then the whole story came out. Ben listened attentively, and when his uncle had finished he said, "That Richmond is a first-class rascal." "And I'd like to give him a first-class kick," said Bradley, indignantly. "That wouldn't mend matters," said Job, shaking his head. "It wouldn't pay off the mortgage." "You say the mortgage amounts to five hundred dollars, Uncle Job?" "Yes. Then there's six months' interest, at six per cent., makes fifteen dollars more." "When do you expect Major Sturgis to call?" "This morning. It's almost time for him." "I met Sam on my way here," said Ben. "He told me I'd come just in the nick of time. I didn't know what he meant, but I know now." "The major offers to buy the house, paying me two hundred and fifty dollars over and above the note." "Why, that's robbery!" said Ben, indignantly. "So it is, Ben; but what can I do?" "I think," said Ben, smiling, "you'd better borrow five hundred and fifteen dollars of your rich nephew." "What do you mean, Ben?" asked Job, in surprise. "I mean this, Uncle Job--that I'll lend you the money to pay up this shark." "You don't mean to say you've got money enough?" ejaculated Uncle Job. "Yes, I do, uncle, and a little over. I'll prove it to you." He produced a wallet, from which he drew out five one-hundred-dollar bills and three fives. "Take them, uncle, and ask me questions afterward, for I see through the window that the major is coming." Indeed, a knock was heard directly, and Job, answering it himself, ushered in the stately figure of Major Sturgis. The major looked around him in surprise, finding more persons than he expected to see. "Don't you remember Ben, Major Sturgis?" asked Job. "When did you come home, Benjamin," asked the major, taken by surprise. "I have just arrived, sir." "Tired of California, eh?" "For the present, yes, sir." "I think my son Sam wishes to see you. He thinks of offering you a place." Ben bowed and smiled. He understood what sort of a place Sam was likely to offer. "Well, Mr. Stanton," asked the major, pompously, "have you decided to accept my offer for the house?" "No, major. Your offer is too small." "You are quite at liberty to look around for a higher bid, or rather you were. Now it is too late." "Just so, major. On the whole I don't think I want to sell." "'Don't want to sell'?" repeated the major, frowning; "you will have to sell." "Why will Uncle Job have to sell?" demanded Ben, irritated by the major's tone. "Young man," said the major, grandly, "this is not a matter with which you have anything to do. Your uncle and I can arrange it between ourselves." "Still, I shall advise Uncle Job to pay the mortgage, though he was swindled into agreeing to it." "I apprehend," sneered the major, "he will have some difficulty in paying me five hundred and fifteen dollars." "I guess I can manage to do it, major," said Job, mildly. "I don't believe you," said the major, hastily. "Have you got the mortgage with you?" asked Job. "Yes; here it is." "And here is your money," said the shoemaker, producing the bills. Major Sturgis received them in amazement bordering upon stupefaction, and counted them over three times. "I guess they're all right," said Job. "Where did you get them?" inquired the major, unable to control his curiosity. "I guess that doesn't matter so long as they're good," answered Job. "Still, I've no objection to tellin' you that it's Ben's money that he's kindly lent to me." "Did you bring this from California?" asked the major, turning to our hero. "Yes, sir," answered Ben. "Have you any more?" "I've got enough more, so that I don't expect to need the situation Sam thought of offering me." When Major Sturgis left the cottage his grand air had passed off, and he looked disappointed and mortified. Sam's spirits, too, were perceptibly dashed when he learned that the boy he disliked had been successful in California. "That settles the major," said Ben. "This afternoon I will see what I can do in the case of Richmond." "You can't do anything, Ben," said his aunt. "Leave him to the reproaches of his own conscience." "He hasn't got any conscience, Aunt Clarissa," said Ben.--"Jake, will you ride over with me to the next town this afternoon?" "I shall be glad to, Ben." Ben went at once to the office of an able lawyer, engaged his services, and put the matter into his hands. The result was, that John Richmond received a note by messenger summoning him to the lawyer's office. He at first tried to bluster, then to temporize, but the lawyer was stern and threatened to exhaust the resources of the law in behalf of his clients. Like most bullies, Richmond was a coward, and ended by giving a note for the full amount, with interest, at thirty days. "You had better leave this note with me," said the lawyer to Ben; "I will collect it when due." And he did. With a crestfallen air John Richmond had to confess himself defeated in his mean attempt at swindling, for he had obtained Uncle Job's indorsement with the deliberate intention of leaving him to pay the note, supposing that the old man would be too timid to do anything about it. Ben remained in Hampton a week. During that time he bought the three-acre lot adjoining--the major having given up the purchase when his plan of getting possession of Job Stanton's little property fell through--and gave it to his uncle. This made Job feel like a rich man, and he only accepted it on Ben's assurance that he had plenty more money. At the end of a week Ben received a letter from Richard Dewey, informing him that he proposed to go into business for himself in the city of New York, and was anxious to engage Ben as a clerk. This offer was too good to refuse. So Ben, a month later, found himself in a responsible business position. As his employer within a few months came into possession of his wife's large fortune, which her guardian was reluctantly obliged to surrender, he was not hampered by lack of capital, but within a year had his business securely established. Ten years have passed. Ben is now junior partner, and enjoys a high reputation for business ability. A year since he married his cousin Jennie, and in so doing has made a wise choice. He lives in the city, but Uncle Job and his wife still live in Hampton, though Job is no longer compelled to work for a livelihood. He has given up his shop, and confines himself to the cultivation of his small tract of land. Though now seventy, his eye is not dim nor his natural force abated. Major Sturgis is dead, and Sam, it is understood, has wasted a considerable portion of the handsome property that was left him. It is quite possible that he may end in poverty and destitution, and be forced at last to work for a living. This he would regard as a misfortune, but it will probably be a blessing in disguise, for the necessity of honest labor is generally a salutary restraint. Bradley has gone back to California. His son in now with him, and both are prosperous. Richard Dewey and his wife are rich and happy (the two do not always go together), and have four children, the second of whom, a boy, is named Benjamin Stanton Dewey, in honor of our hero. I have endeavored to ascertain what became of our Mongolian friend, Ki Sing, but without entire success. My impression is, that he started a laundry in San Francisco, made enough money for a Chinaman to retire upon, and went back to his native land to live in competence, the happy husband of a high-born Chinese maiden with incredibly small feet. Doubtless, he has more than once retailed to wondering ears the account of his adventures and perils when he, as well as Ben, visited California "in search of fortune." THE END. FAMOUS ALGER BOOKS.

IN A NEW WORLD. _Other Volumes in Preparation._ Good Form for Men A Guide to Conduct and Dress on All Occasions BY CHARLES HARCOURT This thoroughly sensible and manly book is best described by a review which appeared in the Philadelphia "Public Ledger:" Books on etiquette are not generally of such a character as to be worth the notice of self-respecting men. They are generally left to the "young misses" and "gents" who live in mortal fear of being found out to be what they feel themselves to be. "Good Form for Men," however, is above the average of its kind, for it is conceived and written in a wholesome, manly spirit. There is nothing finical or foppish about the conventions which Mr. Harcourt undertakes to codify and explain. "Society," thereby meaning well-bred and cultured men and women, has as much right to lay down rules to dress and conduct as any "secret" society has to insist upon ritual and ceremony. Mr. Harcourt's book is a thoroughly sensible one and may be studied with profit by men who, not being to the manner born, desire to feel at ease among the cultured. Good Form for Women A Guide to Conduct and Dress on All Occasions BY MRS. CHARLES HARCOURT The writer addresses the great mass who make up the backbone of our country and takes no account of the passing fads of fashion.

ONLY A NURSE GIRL! THE STORY OF ALICE AYRES. On the night of Thursday, 25th April, 1886, the cry rang through Union Street, Borough, that the shop of Chandler, the oilman, was in flames. So rapid was the progress of the fire that, by the time the escapes reached the house, tongues of flame were shooting out from the windows, and it was impossible to place the ladders in position. The gunpowder had exploded with great violence, and casks of oil were burning with an indescribable fury. As the people rushed together to the exciting scene they were horrified to find at one of the upper windows a girl, clad only in her night-dress, bearing in her arms a child, and crying for help. It was Alice Ayres, who, finding there was no way of escape by the staircase, was seeking for some means of preserving the lives of the children in her charge. The frantic crowd gathered below shouted for her to save herself; but that was not her first aim. Darting back into the blinding smoke, she fetched a feather-bed and forced it through the window. This the crowd held whilst she carefully threw down to them one of the children, which alighted safe on the bed. Again the people in the street called on her to save her own life; but her only answer was to go back into the fierce flames and stifling smoke, and bring out another child, which was safely transferred to the crowd below. Once again they frantically entreated her to jump down herself; and once again she staggered back blinded and choking into the fiery furnace; and for the third time emerged, bearing the last of her charges, whose life also was saved. Then, at length, she was free to think of herself. But, alas! her head was dizzy and confused, and she was no longer able to act as surely as she had hitherto done. She jumped--but, to the horror of that anxious admiring throng below, her body struck against the projecting shop-sign, and rebounded, falling with terrific force on to the hard pavement below. Her spine was so badly injured that although everything possible was done for her at Guy's Hospital, whither she was removed, she died on the following Sunday. Beautiful windows have been erected at Red Cross Hall, Southwark, to commemorate her heroism; but the best memorial is her own expression: "I tried to do my best"--for this will live in the hearts of all who read of her self-devotion. She had tried to do her best _always_. Her loving tenderness to the children committed to her care and her pure gentle life were remarked by those around her before there was any thought of her dying a heroic death. So, when the great trial came, she was prepared; and what seems to us Divine unselfishness appeared to her but simple duty. A SLAVE TRADE WARRIOR. SOME STORIES OF SIR SAMUEL BAKER. Sir Samuel Baker, who died at the end of the year 1893, aged seventy-three, will always be remembered for the splendid work he did in the Soudan during the four years he ruled there, and for his explorations in Africa. In earlier life he had done good service in Ceylon, had been in the Crimea during the Russian war, and had superintended the construction of the first Turkish railway. Then, at the age of forty, he turned his attention to African travel. Accompanied by his wife, he left Cairo in 1861; and, after exploring the Blue Nile, arrived in 1862 at Khartoum, situated at the junction of the White and Blue Nile. Later on he turned southward. In spite of the opposition of slave owners, and without guide or interpreter, he reached the Albert Nyanza; and when, after many perils, he got safely back to Northern Egypt, his fame as an explorer was fully established. His was the first expedition which had been successful in penetrating into Central Africa from the north. On his return to England he was welcomed with enthusiasm, and received many honours. In the year 1869, at the request of the Khedive of Egypt, Sir Samuel undertook a journey to the Soudan to put down the slave trade. He was given supreme power for a period of four years. In December, with a small army of about 1500 men, he left Cairo for Gondokoro, about 3000 miles up the Nile, accompanied by his wife. It was a terrible journey. His men fell ill, the water in the river was low in many places, and the passage blocked up. At times he had to cut channels for his ships; the men lost heart; and, had the leader not been firm and steadfast, he would never have reached his destination. On one occasion he found his thirty vessels stranded, the river having almost dried up. Nothing daunted, he cut his way through a marsh, making a progress of only twelve miles in about a fortnight. At the end of this time he found it was impossible to proceed further along that course, and had to return to the place he had left and begin again. Still, in spite of all obstacles, he made steady progress. At Sobat, situated on the Nile above Khartoum, he established a station, and had a watch kept on passing ships to see that no slaves were conveyed down the river. One day a vessel came in sight, and keeping in the middle of the river would have passed by without stopping. But Sir Samuel, having his suspicions aroused, sent to inspect it. The captain declared stoutly he had no slaves aboard. He stated that his cargo consisted simply of corn and ivory. The inspector was not convinced, and determined to test the truth of this statement. Taking a ramrod, he drove it into the corn. This produced an answering scream from below, and a moment later a woolly head and black body were disclosed. Further search was made, and a hundred and fifty slaves were discovered packed as close as herrings in a barrel. Some were in irons, one was sewn up in a sail cloth, and all had been cruelly treated. Soon the irons were knocked off and the poor slaves set free, to their great wonder and delight. Sir Samuel arrived at Gondokoro on the 15th of April, 1871. Already two years of his time had expired. In addition to checking the slave trade, he had been commissioned to introduce a system of regular commerce. He set to work at once to show the people the benefits of agricultural pursuits. He got his followers to plant seeds, and soon they were happy enough watching for the green shoots to appear. But before long they began to suffer from want of food. The tribes round about had been set against them by the slave hunters, and would supply them with nothing; so that Baker, in the midst of plenty, seemed likely to perish of starvation. However, he soon adopted energetic measures to prevent that. Having taken official possession of the land in the name of the Khedive he seized a sufficient number of animals for his requirements. The head man of the tribe and his followers were soon buzzing about his ears like a swarm of wasps; but seeing he was not to be frightened by their threats they showed themselves ready enough in the future to supply him with cattle in return for payment. His own soldiers were nearly as troublesome as the natives. They were lazy and mutinous; the sentries went to sleep, the scouts were unreliable, they were full of complaints; whilst round about him were the natives, ready to steal, maim, and murder whenever they could get an opportunity. His life was daily in danger; and, so as not to be taken unawares, he organised a band of forty followers for his personal service. On these men he could always rely. They were proud of the confidence placed in them, and were ready to go anywhere and do anything. By a strange perversity they were nicknamed "the forty thieves," though they were amongst the very few who were honest. What with sickness and fighting and losses encountered on the way up the river, Baker's force was now reduced to about five hundred men, in place of the twelve hundred whom he had once reviewed at Gondokoro. Still, he did not despair of accomplishing, with God's help, the mission on which he had been sent. In January, 1872, with his wife and only two hundred and twelve officers and men, he started south on a journey of three or four hundred miles into the region where the slave trade was carried on with the greatest activity. He had arranged with one of the chiefs to supply him with two thousand porters to carry the goods of the expedition; but when the time came not a single man was forthcoming. So his soldiers had to be their own carriers for a time. At a later date he was enabled to hire five hundred men to assist him to transport his goods, and presented each with a cow as a reward for his services. All took the cows readily enough, but sixty-seven of the carriers did not appear at the time appointed. The others were extremely desirous of going to look after them; but Baker, knowing their ways full well, thought it better to lose the services of the sixty-seven men rather than to allow this; for he felt sure if they once returned to search for their companions there would be no chance of seeing a single one of them again. After many perils he reached the territory of Kabbu Rega on the Victoria Nile. The king was apparently friendly at first. But on several occasions the war drums sounded, and although no violence was actually offered yet Sir Samuel thought it well to be on his guard. He therefore set his men to work to build a strong fort. They cut thick logs of wood, and planted them firmly in the ground, prepared fireproof rooms for the ammunition, and were in the course of a few days ready in case of emergency. These preparations had been made none too soon. [Illustration: Burning the king's Divan and Huts.] A few days later a very strange thing happened. The king sent Sir Samuel a present of some jars of cider. This he gave to his troops. A little while afterwards one of his officers rushed in to say the men had been poisoned. It was really so. The men who had drunk of the cider were lying about in terrible pain, and apparently dying. At once Sir Samuel gave them mustard and water and other emetics, and they were soon better. But he knew that trouble was at hand. Next morning he was standing at the entrance to the fort with one of his men when a chorus of yells burst upon his ear. He told his bugler to sound the alarm, and was walking towards the house to get a rifle when the man beside him fell shot through the heart. The fort was surrounded by thousands of natives, who kept up a continuous fire, and the bushes near at hand were full of sharp-shooters. But the fort was strong, and its defenders fought bravely; the woods were gradually cleared of sharp-shooters, and the natives, ere long, broke and fled. Then Sir Samuel sent a detachment out of the fort, and set fire to the king's divan and to the surrounding huts to teach the people a lesson for their treachery. But the place was full of foes. A poisoned spear was thrown at Sir Samuel, and every day he remained his force was in danger of destruction, so he determined to go on to King Riongo, whom he hoped would be more friendly. It is wonderful that the party ever got there. First of all it was found that they would probably be a week without provisions; but, happily, Lady Baker had put by some supplies, and great was the rejoicing when her forethought became known. Then it was discovered that the country through which they had to pass was full of concealed foes. From the long grass and bushes spears were constantly hurled at them, and not a few of the men were mortally wounded. Sir Samuel saw several lances pass close to his wife's head, and he narrowly escaped being hit on various occasions. But, at last, Riongo's territory was reached. The king was friendly, and for a time they were in comparative safety. By April, 1873, Baker had returned to Gondokoro, and his mission ended. It was, to a great extent, the story of a failure, so far as its main purpose was concerned, owing to the opposition of the men who were making a profit by dealing in slaves; and who, whilst appearing to be friendly, stirred up the natives to attack him. But, failure though it was, he had done all that man could do; and the expedition stands out as one of the most glorious efforts which have been made against overwhelming odds to put an end to the slave trade. TWO WORKING MEN HEROES. THE STORY OF CASE AND CHEW. The large gasholders, which are often a source of wonder to youthful minds as they rise and fall, are the places in which gas is stored for the use of our cities. By day, when they are generally receiving more gas than ribs. The silk will make good covering, too. Drop a glass bead on your propeller axle—it will do for ball bearing. Put some vaseline on it. Be sure to have your covering hang a little over the back of the planes to hold the air a second, and I think the cover of a fountain pen would do better than a gas tip to hold your sticks together—it’s lighter. Hairpins are handy, too. Maybe you’ve got one of those bamboo porch screens that pull up and down. The strips would be great if you’re making a curved plane. If your sisters have any old hats with flowers on them, you’ll find good thin wire inside the stems. Peel the green stuff off. The wire would be just the thing for binding your frame corners, too. Don’t get discouraged. We’ve got them beaten already. Only don’t be too reckless with your glue, and have plenty of oil on your cog chain. And don’t have your propeller go too fast—it only cuts a hole in the air. If you could get hold of one of those little hoops ladies embroider on, you could cut it in half and you’d have good rudder frames. If you need strong spring wire, the sides of a pair of spectacles would be just the thing. You might find some good stuff in a willow chair. Be sure not to have any flat surfaces against the air. We’ll try to see you before we go home. We’re up on Bulwagga Mountain now—still hunting. Hope to get a clue this afternoon or night. Your friend, Harry Arnold. P. S—If you can’t get hold of a lady’s hat, maybe Miss Crosby, over at Buck Mansion, can fix you up. Tell her I deduced that she has a few. Gordon had a fight with a lynx—how’s that? Lost his shirt and gained an adventure. The night continued cloudy, and the boys had no alternative but to turn in again with neither information nor clue. And this was especially unfortunate since the moon was rising later each evening and soon all hope of night searching would have to be abandoned. “Kid,” said Harry, “I don’t think they’d have gone north of this—I can’t get that woods down there out of my mind. But we could never follow the stream down, old boy, not with your leg as it is. It means more climbing than walking. It looks to me as if the stream would be a series of waterfalls. Then I wouldn’t dare go far from it without a compass.” “Harry, now don’t spoil it all, whatever you do. I won’t vote for sending up a signal—there’s no use asking me. We’re going to find _them_. And everything is going fine. Gracious, I was scared when I lost that compass, but now I know it’s the regular thing to do, Harry. Now, there was a fellow they called the Black Ranger, and he did the same thing, and it said that without food or compass and limping from his wound, he pressed on with dauntless courage. And we’ve even got the limp, Harry—if it don’t go and get well before we find them. We ought not to find them, Harry, till we are well-nigh exhausted.” “How’s that?” “We ought to drag ourselves, weary but triumphant, into camp.” “Hmmm,” said Harry. He lay awake long, thinking. They might kindle a large signal fire on the mountain, but that, if it were seen, would lessen the triumph of finding the camp. It would be, in a way, calling for assistance, and he did not like the idea any more than Gordon did. The morning dawned dull and cloudy; it bade fair to be a repetition of the previous day. Gordon slept long, and when he awoke he found the shelter empty save for himself. While he was pulling on his things, Harry came in, his mood wholly out of keeping with the weather. “Hello there, Kiddo! Here are some minnows for breakfast.” “Hello! I guess we won’t see any sign of campfire to-night. Doesn’t this weather beat all!” “Don’t grumble about the weather now. This is just the day to do my sewing. I’ve got to patch up your stocking and fix you up generally, so that if you should meet any maidens you’ll be in shape to recount your adventures.” “What’ll be our next move, Harry?” “Our next move will be to explore that woods down there. That’s the likeliest place for camp that they could strike in this vicinity, it seems to me. It’s between the two forts, it’s flat woodland, and it’s got a stream running through it—this stream that begins up here. So I think we’d better get right down there and not waste any more time up here.” “But when we get down on the mountain side, Harry, we won’t be able to see where we’re going.” “We’re going down just the way we came up,” said Harry, “and strike into the Port Henry Road. I think we’ll hit a road that goes around the northern end of this old mountain and skirts the shore, and we’ll follow that along till we strike the stream in level country. If they’re down there at all, they’re near the stream—you can be sure of that; and we’ll follow along the stream to the lake. I shouldn’t be in the least surprised if we found them.” “But if we don’t?” “Then we’ll go on to Port Henry, and I’ll buy a regular spyglass there if they have such a thing—and on to Bald Knob.—And if the collar button’s under the bed, we’ll find it, or break our necks in the attempt!” “Or drop in our tracks is better, Harry.” “Well, we’ll do that, then. So now for minnows and coffee and—do you want bacon?” “Surely.” “Bacon it is, and then the sewing circle. Dump that spool of thread out of the coffee pot, will you? Kid, you’re a horrible sight! You look as if you’d been through a sawmill.” By ten o’clock they were picking their way down the western slope toward the Port Henry road. It is probably the easiest descent from the southern peak, but it was difficult for all that. Noontime found them again in open country, trudging along the road toward the little village of Port Henry, which is on the lake shore about three miles north of the mountain. Instinctively, each took a side of the road, watching it closely as they went along. Now and then Harry would pause to examine a trampled spot near the roadside. Every suspicious stone was carefully scrutinized, then kicked aside for any secret it might be hiding. Usually their inspection was only casual, and they discovered nothing which justified them in pausing. Footprints were out of the question considering the length of time which had elapsed and the rain which had fallen. Every time Harry paused, Gordon looked expectantly over and asked, “What did you strike?” and Harry would answer, “Nothing.” They had almost reached the crossroad when Harry stopped to examine a little hole in the ground, no larger in circumference than a broom stick. He stuck a twig into the hole, finding that it was about six inches deep. “Locust hole?” asked Gordon, going over. “Don’t think so,” Harry answered, pulling the grass carefully away from it. “It’s octagon-shaped, isn’t it? Let’s have a match.” He held the match down. “Humph, seems to go to a point, doesn’t it?” They stood looking at each other. “Morrel has an octagon-shaped staff, hasn’t he, Kid!” Gordon’s face was an ample substitute for the recreant sun. “We’ve found them! We’ve found them, Harry!” he shouted. “Let’s sit down and think,” said Harry, quietly. “Kid, that crossroad ahead there would take us round under the mountain, under the precipice, and so into the woods below.” “Harry, we’re on their trail!” “You don’t call a hole in the ground a trail, do you? This is nothing but a poor, weak, sickly little apology for a clue. So don’t go up in the air. In the first place, has Morrel an octagon staff, or hasn’t he?” “He has, Harry.” “All right, now you’re talking. Evidently they stopped and talked here. That stick must have been stuck down pretty well into the ground to leave a hole that would stay there after the rain we’ve had in the last couple of days. But if they knew they wanted to get into that woods, why didn’t they come up the shore? What were they doing away in here west of the mountain? Let’s take a look at that road for a little way.” They could see by the map that the crossroad skirted the northern slope of the mountain and ran along the bay shore, under the precipitous east wall, and thence into the woods. But surely if the Oakwood troop had come up from Ticonderoga knowing their destination, they would have taken another and easier way to reach it. With their inspection of the crossroad, the weak, sickly little clue grew to robust proportions. “Here’s where Mac got hungry, Kid,” Harry commented, kicking a piece of silver paper. “Let’s see, now, if we can make anything out of all this.” He looked smilingly round. Meanwhile, Gordon’s observant eye had discovered something which gladdened his heart,—a true, out-and-out scout sign. A little way down the crossroad, along the right-hand side, a small square was scratched with stone on a rock, with an arrow pointing from one of its sides. It did not take Gordon long to take three paces from this stone in the direction of the arrow. “Let’s have your ax, Harry.” In a minute more, both boys were sitting by the roadside poring over a few words written on a piece of paper, which puzzled them more than they helped, however. It simply said, in what appeared to be a hasty scrawl: “If any of you come back this way, follow blazing.” “_If any of them come back this way_,” repeated Harry. “What in the dickens have they done—separated?” In a moment the answer came to him. “Kid,” he said, “I may be all wrong, but I have an idea that some of them went on into Port Henry to hire boats. That’s why they were up as far as this. Probably they couldn’t find half a dozen canoes and dories farther down. Here’s where they separated. Some went on, and the rest stayed here—you can see they loafed around here—look at the chocolate wrapper. Mac can’t sit down a minute without eating—he’ll weigh a ton if he keeps on. Maybe the fellows that went on expected to make arrangements for boats and perhaps come down the lake in them. Anyway, the boys that waited here probably thought that some of them might come back along this road expecting to find them, so when they decided to go on they left this. I can’t make it out—they’ve been here, that’s sure, and they’ve blazed a way off this road down a ways. Come on!” They started down the road, watching carefully for any signs. Gordon was almost too excited to speak. “Oh, Harry, won’t it be great when we find them! What’ll we say?” They came to a blazed tree and turned into the woods. Other trees were blazed at intervals of a few yards, leading deeper and deeper into the forest. They were now shut off from any outlook and did not know in what direction they were traveling; but they followed the blazing, and before long the lake showed in silvery patches through the trees. “Harry,” said Gordon, stopping, “let’s decide how we’ll act. I say, let’s just walk in as if nothing had happened and sit down. When they ask us questions we’ll just answer kind of careless, and stretch ourselves, you know, as if we didn’t want to be bothered. I’ve been thinking, Harry, and I believe that’ll be better than dragging ourselves into camp, hungry and exhausted, but with dauntless courage. You see, the trouble is, Harry, there’s really enough food left in our packs for several days more. By rights we ought not to find them till about three days after our—what is it they call food, Harry?” “Grub?” suggested Harry. “No—means of something or other—” “Means of sustenance?” “That’s it, Harry,—till our means of sustenance is exhausted. Then again, Harry, I don’t really look so very bad—I mean I don’t look bad _enough_.” “You look very dressy, Kid.” “Now, keep quiet about that, Harry. I mean I don’t look as if the bleak wind had penetrated to my very—” “You look as if you needed a pair of stockings,” said Harry. “We’ll have to get some in Port Henry. You’ve got an extra pair, but you ought to have two good pairs in case we should happen to go—” “Ha! What did I tell you? Didn’t I say you’d be going there again? And now you want to use me for a scapegrace!” “A what?” “Well, you know what it is when you want to do a thing and lay the whole blame on somebody else.” “Oh, that’s a scapegoat.” They had walked on and now reached a spot where they stopped short. It was within a few yards of the shore. Before them was a large charred spot, covered with ashes. A rough pole rested horizontally between two saplings. A stream flowed into the lake near by. The ground was trampled, and they could plainly see stake holes. Clearly, there had been a camp here. Both boys stood silent, contemplating the deserted spot. “Well, what—do—you—think—of—that!” said Gordon. “Kid,” said Harry, after a minute, “this is where we saw the smoke from Dibble Mountain—just about where I thought. We didn’t see it from Bulwagga that first night because it wasn’t here.” “Correct; be seated, Master Arnold.” “What do you say, Kid?” “I have only one thing to say, Harry. We have been handed a large and juicy lemon.” “Let’s go down and look around the shore.” The shore was sloping in one place—an ideal spot for hauling up canoes; but no sign was there, not the slightest ruffle in the sand, to indicate that any boats had been there. “Maybe they went back the way they came, Harry.” Harry paid no heed to this remark, but walked about the shore, stooping now and then, examining it closely. He walked along the stream to its nearest point to the deserted camp, but found nothing. Gordon sat on a large rock by the shore, watching him. “Harry, you look like an Uncle Tom’s Cabin bloodhound.” Harry, meanwhile, had taken a stick and prodded it into the water under the rock. “Pretty deep, eh?” he said. Then he felt of the rock by Gordon’s side. His finger rested on what appeared to be a wet spot, but it was perfectly dry. He leaned down and smelled of it. “Take a whiff of that, Kid.” Gordon smelled it. “You can’t prove anything by me, Harry.” Harry vaulted on to the rock and sat by Gordon’s side. “You’d better read up what your old college chum, General Baden-Powell, has to say about smelling clues, my son,—that’s a grease spot.” “Maybe somebody laid a frankfurter there,” suggested Gordon. “More likely it was an oily rag out of a motor-boat. Now, kindly keep your seats, ladies and gentlemen; the show is not over.” But Gordon, heedless, had taken a flying leap, and was sniffing the spot with inquisitive enthusiasm. “I smell it! I smell it!” said he. “Oh, Harry, I smell it! It’s gasoline! Eureka! Excelsior! or whatever they call it!” “I think not,” said Harry, quietly. “It was a wipe rag. Probably the engine went on strike—as it naturally would if Walden monkeyed with it. I never thought Walden’s bungling would be any use, but I believe he’s done us a good turn here. Let this be a lesson to you, my son, never to smoke cigarettes.” “Harry,” said Gordon, dramatically, “I never shall. But kindly tell me what that’s got to do with a motor-boat—or with Walden, either—he doesn’t smoke.” “No, nor any other scout. And you show me a fellow that smells an oil stain in the open air after two days of rain, and I’ll deduce for you whether he smokes cigarettes or not. You can take that little sermon from your patrol leader, and if you don’t believe me, ask Red Deer.” “If I ever see him again, Professor Arnold.” “You’ll see him again, all right,” said Harry, examining the grease spot. “Do you understand Latin?” “I can tell if there’s any quinine in a prescription, Harry.” “Well, listen to this: _In hoc signo vinces._” “Harry, _don’t_ tell me they’re in hock!” “No, some one came down here in a motor-boat, got the rest, and went chugging back again.” “You’re a _perfect ghoul!_,” cried Gordon, mimicking Miss Crosby. “You’ve picked up a loose chug—you _know_ you have! It’s just _wonderful_!” “Do you want to know what _In hoc signo vinces_ means, you little monkey?” “I shall never be happy till I find out.” “Well, then,” said Harry, pointing to the grease spot, “it means, “By this sign thou wilt conquer.” “But I don’t see how you know they went off in the motor-boat, Harry. Even supposing there was a motor-boat here, there’s nothing to show the fellows went off in her. It might have been just somebody that stopped here to visit the camp.” “Well,” said Harry, “they didn’t go back the way they came, that’s sure. They’d never have left that note under the rock if they’d gone right back past it. There’s no other road leading away from here, and I don’t believe they’d have struck right across country. I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t follow the railroad track either, so there’s nothing left but the motor-boat. We shall now count the railroad ties from here to Port Henry.” CHAPTER XVIII AT THE FINISH LINE “Now we’ve got something to go on,” said Harry, as they walked along the road that skirts the shore. “You mean, _they’ve_ got something to go on, if your idea is right,” Gordon corrected. “Think the sun’s coming out, Harry.” The belated sun was indeed breaking through the clouds. Harry saw from his map that there was but one stream emptying into the lake between them and Port Henry, and on reaching this they found that it was not suitable for even a motor-dory. They had no intention of making inquiries in the village, their plan being now to go up the lake shore till they found a boat, or boats, moored, or streams to explore. They would march straight through the village as if they did not know it was there. “I understand we’re not to recognize Port Henry, Kid?” “We’ll snub it, Harry. We don’t want to get any directions at the last minute.” But Port Henry had something to say about this. She was not in the habit of having people pass by without acknowledging her, and just at this particular time she was putting on her holiday clothes. She always makes a great splurge in the summer, and in the winter rolls herself up like a bear and goes to sleep. It was well on in the afternoon when Harry and Gordon came in sight of the town and decided to pitch their shelter in a little grove till morning. For Gordon was too weary to go farther. As night came on, they could see the lights of the village in the distance, and they busied themselves speculating what the morrow might bring forth. Harry looked at Gordon critically. “Do you feel you need some meat, old man? How are you, weak?” “No. Just tired. I’m going to turn in early.” “I’ll try for a rabbit if you say, Kid, but I’d rather not. If you’re weak, just say so, and I’ll find you something hearty.” “Bacon and cereal will do for me, Harry.” “All right, then. Sit where you are—I’m going to learn that trick of yours, making a fire. Here, get under the shelter and stuff these cushions back of you. You’re all in, old man; take it easy now.” “Harry, this may be the last supper you and I’ll have together.” “Like enough, if we’re lucky.” “To-morrow’s the Fourth of July.” “So it is!” “I kind of wish we’d have a few days more of it, Harry.” “Why? Suppose you open up that egg powder—sit still now.” “Oh, I don’t know,” said Gordon; “I—I—kind of like being alone with you, Harry.” “Same with me, Kid.” “I hope you’ll never move away from Oakwood, Harry.” “Not much danger of that; our house was built by my grandfather. Look here, Kid, I know what’s the matter with you—you’re just dead tired.” “Your father might put up a new house somewhere else, like Mr. Danforth.” “No sirree! We all think too much of the old shack; and anyway, if he did, there’d be a room for the Black Ranger, all right, no matter where it was. We’d think of a way, Kiddo.” “I don’t know how it is, Harry, I seem to learn things from you without your teaching them to me—I just learn them.” “Nonsense!” “Don’t you think one fellow can learn better from another than from some one else? I mean, Harry, if you think a whole lot of a fel—a person, why, you’d learn more from him than—Now, I’ll never smoke a cigarette after what you said, Harry, and it wasn’t like a lesson at all.” “Guess you’ll never learn much from me, old man—Hand me the saucepan, will you?” “My father thinks I will—and anyway, I’m glad I’m in your patrol.” “Well, the patrol wouldn’t part with G. Lord for a seagoing yacht.” “Just the same, I’d like to be alone with you a little longer, Harry, honest, I would.—I heard Red Deer tell my father how important it is in camping to find pure water. He said fellows about the age of the older ones in our troop are liable to typhoid fever. I hope you’ll never get that, Harry.” “Kid, you’re a great old boy.” “Let’s feel your muscle, will you, Harry?” Harry went over, smiling, and bent his arm slowly back and forth. “My, you wouldn’t think a fellow as thin as you would have a muscle like that, Harry.” Harry laughed outright, and doubling his fist, thrust it gently into the younger boy’s upturned face. The next morning they went into Port Henry, and found the village in gala attire. It was their purpose to hire a canoe, and continue their explorations along the shore and up the smaller streams. This would be easier than mountain-climbing (of which Harry thought Gordon had had enough), and since there was now some reason to expect to find camp along the shore, a little paddling about, as Harry said, would not go half bad. “Port Henry’s dressed up as if she was going to graduate,—hey, Kid?” “She certainly has her pink sash on. I wonder what’s up.” The town was resplendent in bunting festoons and streamers, and every store and house had its flag. The national emblem, of course, predominated, but here and there hung a triangular, purple flag showing the letters M B C in white, with an anchor beneath. Most of the stores were closed, and there was a general air of holiday festivity among the little groups that talked excitedly here and there. The city people were in festive array. Tennis-shirted and sneaker-shod young gentlemen lolled about. “Cracky!” said Gordon, “the shoe business must be good here.” “Yes,” Harry answered. “I don’t suppose there was ever a shoe box but was doomed to carry sandwiches sometime or other. There are a lot of folks here from out of town.” Presently they were reading a big poster in one of the windows: REGATTA MOHAWK BOAT CLUB JULY FOURTH WATER EVENTS AT 2 P.M. SHARP ROWING SWIMMING SAILING MUSIC BY PORT HENRY BAND FIREWORKS IN EVENING BASEBALL! BASEBALL! PORT HENRY VS. PLATTSBURGH _SPECIAL_ GOODWIN, THE DARING AVIATOR, WILL FLY IN HIS AIRSHIP TO VERMONT AND BACK, ALIGHTING ON THE GREEN “Looks as if there were going to be some doings,” said Harry. “Not much chance of getting hold of a canoe to-day, I’m afraid,” commented Gordon. They sauntered up the main street, and could not fail to notice that several people turned and stared at them. Harry thought it was because of their rather battered and disheveled appearance. As they passed the post-office, a little crowd of city fellows called tauntingly after them. “There’s a couple of them, now,” said one. “Hurrah for the Boy Spouts!” another shouted. “Sh-h-h!” said another. “They’re on the trail of a deer—don’t disturb them!” Gordon glanced back, laughing cheerfully at his own expense, and noticed that one of the fellows had a flag with the words WELDEN SCHOOL on it, and that several others wore pale blue sweaters bearing a W on the chest. “Them chaps is goin’ to win the regetty,” volunteered a black-coated man near by, who looked pathetically uncomfortable in his gala attire. “They’re champion experts.” “Bully for them,” said Harry, cheerily. Presently, as they passed a pleasant cottage, a woman with a battalion of small children turned in at the gate. “Give me the key,” they heard her say to one of the boys. “I haven’t got it.” “Who has?” It appeared that none of them had. “Well,” said the woman, in despair, “we’re locked out, then. I _told_ you to put the key in your pocket.” “So I did.” “Well, where is it, then?” “You told me I could leave off my jacket—it’s in my jacket pocket.” The woman stood frowning. “Could we do anything to help you?” said Harry, vaulting the low fence and standing, hat in hand, before her. Gordon followed and stood beside him. “I’m afraid not,” said she. “We’re locked out; it’s most exasperating. John, you’ll have to run straight down to Mr. Berry’s and tell him to come right up.” “Just wait a minute, please,” said Harry. “Maybe we can think of some way to get in. All the windows are locked, I suppose?” He stepped out a little and saw that a window above the doorway was open. From its sill a flagpole projected. “You can never get in there,” said the woman. “Is that a hammock hook on that tree?” Harry asked. “Yes.” “The hammock doesn’t happen to be outdoors anywhere, does it?” The hammock was found to be behind the house, and Harry carried it to the front doorway. The hammock itself, together with its two ropes, formed a line perhaps twelve feet long, which was easily thrown over the inner end of the pole. In a moment Harry had swung himself up to the flagpole and reaching down from it was carefully brushing off the dust which his feet had left on the flag. The woman watched him with an amused smile. “That’s one of the first things we scouts have to learn,” Gordon told her,—“respect for the flag.” Presently Harry opened the front door. The woman was very profuse in her thanks. “There’s nothing to thank me for,” said Harry. “You know, I used to be a burglar,” he added, laughing. “But you must come in,” she said. “I’m sure you’re strangers. What can I do to repay you?” She insisted upon their following her into the cozy little sitting-room. “It was nothing at all,” Harry said. “But if we might ask a favor, perhaps you’d be willing to let us clean up a bit here. My friend—well, I’m really ashamed of him—the fact is, we’ve been mountaineering.” Might they? Indeed they might! And they must also stay and have some lunch. No, she would hear of nothing else. It is a scout’s duty to be polite and not to gainsay a lady, so they—well, they stayed, in obedience to Section 5, Scout Law. When they thanked her and started forth from her hospitable roof, they were quite presentable. She had insisted upon sewing several buttons on Gordon’s uniform, all of which he had unearthed from various pockets, and after a sponging process, he came forth glowing and immaculate. They had also learned something regarding the day’s program. Four rowing crews were entered for a contest,—Plattsburgh, Port Henry, and a crew of boys from the Welden School who were summering at Port Henry. The Welden School was somewhere over in Vermont, or Massachusetts, she thought. Then there was also another crew “from down lake somewheres,” but she guessed the Welden boys would have things their own way. She didn’t care much who won “s’long’s nobody got drowned.” The boys thanked her again and started for the seat of war. They found both shores lined with people as far down as they could see. Harry had hoped to get a glimpse of the racing craft and size up the contesting crews, but the dense throng surrounding the boat-house and float made this impossible. “Come on,” said he, “there’s nothing doing here. Let’s get down to the finish. I don’t believe they’ll pull more than a mile.” They started down the road which skirted the shore, working their way through a labyrinth of buckboards and three-seated stages and throngs of spectators. Overhead, the sky was cloudless, and the sun poured hotly down upon an army of parasols. Out in the lake it touched the still water with gold, and here a little motor-dory, flying the boat-club’s colors, chugged about, warning encroaching canoes off the course. It seemed to be a thankless task, for as fast as one was driven back another darted forward, until the busy, important little boat reminded one of the old woman who lived in a shoe. Down at the finish, the throng expanded into a seething mass. So close together were canoes and dories that they seemed to form a solid float. On the shore, carriages and autos were drawn up. The whole countryside had turned out in holiday attire. Through this dense mass the boys managed, by a series of maneuvers, to reach the shore, and soon stood at a point where they had an open view up the river. The little official boat came chugging down past them, and boldly essayed the task of ordering a handsome steam yacht to get beyond the finish line. “We’re not on the course,” shouted its captain. “Yes, you are, sir,” answered the official bouncer; “you’ll have to get downstream.” The boys listened to this dispute, which was within a few feet of them, with a good deal of curiosity, for there is nothing so interesting as an altercation in a public place, when suddenly there was a frantic waving from the deck of the yacht. “Why, there’s Miss Crosby!” exclaimed Gordon. They waved their caps to her, and she suddenly disappeared. Evidently, she had issued her orders, for the yacht, in utter defiance of rules and regulations, was brought alongside a neighboring pier, and the crowd, no doubt much impressed with its gorgeous appearance, for it was a glittering combination of white and brass, opened to let the two boys pass down and go aboard. “The _idea_!” said Miss Crosby, as she greeted them. “I never _knew_ such downright _tyranny_! That’s the _only_ thing to call it! They seem to think they _own_ the lake!” “I’m afraid it looks as if _we_ thought that,” said a genial voice, and the boys turned in surprise to see Mr. Danforth coming toward them with outstretched hand. “But we couldn’t pass right by you. Miss Crosby said—” “Oh, I _never_ said _anything_ of the kind!” “He probably just deduced it,” laughed Harry, “whatever it was.” Mr. Danforth chuckled; he had evidently heard about their “deducing.” “Well,” said he, cheerily, “who’s going to win the race?” “_We_ don’t even know the program,” said Harry. “We just dropped into town.” “Still hunting?” laughed Mr. Danforth. “Still hunting,” said Harry. “Well, well, you must take an afternoon off and explain the events to us; we’ve been hearing more about you from this young lady.” The young lady gave him a very severe scowl, but it did not deter him in the least. “She’s been very much interested in your trip, and we’ve been comparing notes about you. Now, here we are, met again, all hands around St. Paul’s, as you might say. By Jove, I’m sorry Pen isn’t here! Come aft and let me introduce you to our little party.” The yacht had now steamed out of forbidden territory. Mr. Danforth led the boys to an awning-covered stretch of deck, strewn with oriental rugs and comfortable wicker chairs. The party consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Danforth and their daughters, Miss Antoinette and her mother, and a couple of gentlemen from the city. “Well, now,” said their host, “I don’t believe I’ll have the courage to tell Pen we saw you. You’ll have to go home with us—that’s the only way.” “Mr. Danforth was just saying,” his wife continued, “that he wouldn’t dare tell Pen there was an aeroplane flight; but, I declare, I believe he’ll be even more disappointed at not seeing you.” “Well, probably there won’t be any flight,” said one of the gentlemen; “there usually isn’t.” “That’s so,” said Mr. Danforth; “the weather clerk finds it pretty hard to suit an aviator. Now there isn’t a breath stirring to-day, and the sailing race is off on account of the calm; but you just wait and see if this fellow doesn’t come out with the statement that there’s too much wind.” “Well,” said the other gentleman, “as I understand it, an aviator sometimes means the air above—some distance up. They say the air is always in more rapid circulation up a ways. And then, there are what they call pockets of air—sometimes it’s full of those things up above when it’s calm down here.” “Something like Gordon’s pockets, here, I suppose,” interpolated Harry; “full of all sorts of junk—gusts of wind, odds and ends of squalls, and things like that. I suppose those things would play the mischief with an aeroplane. I don’t know much about the subject myself.” “He does, too,” said Gordon. “Kind of atmospheric spasms,” said Mr. Danforth. “Something like that,” answered his friend. “There’s a kind of little fan they shoot up in the air which will often give them an idea how things are up there—they’ve got to be careful.” “No life-saving stations up there,” laughed Mr. Danforth. “Well, I just wish you could see Pen’s new model, Harry. The motor actually does go for nearly a minute. It’s the most ingenious thing I ever saw. By Jove, if the little fellow doesn’t win that contest, I believe it’ll kill him! He’s just counting the days till we get to Oakwood.” The conversation was interrupted by the muffled sound of cheering along the shore. The yacht was brought around so that the deck aft commanded a vista of smooth water, reflecting in long perspective its bordering rows of waiting spectators, and the party had an unobstructed view up the course. Far up the shore, flags and caps were waving, showing that the first heat had begun. The judge’s launch chugged around under the yacht’s stern and out into midstream. The patrol boat, with a great deal of racket, made a final cruise driving back unruly canoes and punts. Neighboring boats which gloried in the possession of whistles, began tooting them. There was a general bustle of suspense and expectation. The cheering up the course rolled nearer like a wave. A gay little dory, containing a dozen fellows in pale blue sweaters, who were shouting a club or school yell, shot across the course, in laughing defiance of the judge, and took an advantageous position. “Hurrah for Welden!” shouted some one. “Those boys are going to win in a walk,” called a voice under the yacht’s rail. “They’re college trained.” Far up the course, two slender craft shot into view. Harry took the glass from Mr. Danforth and saw that one of them was leading by more than a length. As they neared, the space between them steadily increased. He handed the glass to Miss Crosby. “The crew on the left are rowing ragged,” he told her. “They may catch up,” she said excitedly. “Just _see_ how they splash!” “’Fraid not,” Harry answered. “It’s all over. It was won before it began.” It was certainly won long before it was finished. Amid excited cheering and frantic waving of flags, a single boat glided past the finish line. The other crew had gone to pieces up the course. “Who are those that won?” Mr. Danforth called over the rail to one of the boats that were clustered thick under the yacht’s stern. “The college boys,” some one answered. “Plattsburgh crew stopped to fish.” “I don’t believe they did,” said the girl, incredulously. “No, I don’t either; there isn’t any good fishing up there,” said Harry, soberly. “Who ought I to cheer for?” she asked, surveying the party. “Well, I guess those college boys are right in your line,” Harry said. “They’re certainly first-class oarsmen. I believe they come from somewhere over in Massachusetts, don’t they? What’s that their friends are waving?” Amid much laughter, the blue-sweater crowd had hoisted a great banner above their little craft, on which was printed in charcoal: These are our regulations,— There’s just one fate for the scout, And the hayseeds, too, And when we’re through They’ll look like all get-out! There were loud congratulations from the occupants of this launch to the victorious crew, whom they boisterously pulled into their craft. The two heroes, who, it was plain to see, were crack rowers, joined them in a most complicated and idiotic conglomeration of rah, rah, rahs, cisses, booms, and the usual vocabulary of victorious athletes. But the program had taken on a new interest for Harry and Gordon, and they awaited the next heat with some suspense. To be sure, it was likely enough that a town the size of Plattsburgh would have a troop of scouts, or, for that matter, there might be a troop even in such a little village as Port Henry. But the Oakwood boys had never given this a thought, until now it appeared that a crew of scouts was to row in the second trial. “That’s a pretty good one on you boys,” laughed Mr. Danforth, referring to the placard. “What scouts do they mean, anyway?” “You’ve got _me_,” said Harry. “I don’t know; there must be a troop, or at least, a patrol, organized somewhere round here. They’ll never outrow that blue-sweater crowd, I can tell you that.” “Well, that’s a good taunt, anyway,” Mr. Danforth laughed. “_I_ think it’s _insulting_,” said Miss Crosby; “and it’s perfectly _dreadful_ poetry.” By a series of inquiries among the jubilant throng below, the party succeeded in learning that the next heat was to be between the Port Henry boys and some boy scouts from somewhere. The moments seemed long before the excitement along the shore told that the second pair of contestants were coming down the course. Soon they shot into view, gliding abreast, as it seemed, with the little power-boat of the referee close in their wake. Harry studied the crews with his glasses, as the rise and fall of the oars became discernible. “They’re walking along, all right,” he said, handing Gordon the glass. “Can you make out their flags?” They had left the three-quarters flag behind them, and the moving backs of the rowers and the long sweep of the oars were plainly visible. The rowing seemed mechanical—perfect. Each shell held its way wonderfully between strokes. Neither bow swerved, but they came down through the cheering, frantic crowds like two arrows. The flags, fluttering behind, afforded no hint to those at the finish line, but as the shells neared, loud shouts went up for Port Henry, and many flags were waved. A clumsy-looking motor-boat shot out from the shore, and followed in the wake of the referee’s boat, as close as it dared. It held several people, notably a man in white. The party on the yacht watched breathlessly as the oars rose dripping from the water, paused a fraction of a second in air, then plunged silently, uniformly, into the sun-flecked lake. Far forward, far backward, leaned each crew with mathematical precision, as the shells, side by side, sped on. Then one crept forward. “They’re hitting it up,” said Harry, as deafening yells rose about them. They were close on the finish line now, one nearly half a length ahead. Cheers for Port Henry filled the air. “Come on! Row!” some one shouted. “You’re walking away from them!” The second boat’s prow was even with the forward rower of the rival shell. Then it lagged even with the second oarsman. Then it fell astern, amid a pandemonium of waving and yelling. “It’s all over,” some one called. Then a voice from the motor-boat following called, “Lengthen out!” The cry seemed to give new courage to the pair in the second shell. Their prow again rode level with the second member of the rival crew. Again they bent forward, their oars seemed for a second glued to the boat’s side, and as they rose again she shot forward. Again, and still again, the lithe forms bent, forward, back, and with each rise of the straining figures the craft leaped forward. Now the two shells were even, their crews rowing like demons. Then again amid the shouting from both shores, the voice from the motor-boat cried, “Lengthen out!” and the shell which had regained its position darted forward again, past the other boat, and amid a bedlam of yells, the screech of whistles, and the frantic waving of a thousand handkerchiefs and flags, glided past the finish line, a half-length ahead of its rival. In the moment of triumph, one of the victorious rowers was seen to sway, then sink forward. Harry could see it plainly—it was within a few yards of the yacht. The referee’s launch chugged up; some one called to the white figure in the old motor-boat, which was also drawing near. Others paddled up with congratulations and inquiries. “Is there a doctor ashore?” some one called. “No need for that, sir,” said the white figure in the approaching motor-boat. “I’m a doctor myself—just help me get him aboard here.” Harry clutched the rail, speechless. He knew that voice, he knew that manner, he knew the glitter of the gold spectacles; yes, and he should have recognized before the spotless suit of white duck. It was Red Deer. CHAPTER XIX THE FATE OF THE BLUE SWEATERS All this had happened amid so much confusion and excitement on the lake, that before Harry realized it the stricken oarsman had been transferred to the motor-boat, which went chugging back up the course. Then he and Gordon stared blankly at each other. Even if they had had the presence of mind to call to Dr. Brent, it is doubtful if they could have made themselves heard above the tumult. “It was Red Deer, Harry.” “Sure it was—and that was Mac they lifted out.” “Who _is_ Red Deer?” asked Miss Crosby, excitedly. “Were those _scouts_ that won?” For a moment Harry was too preoccupied to explain. “Yes, those were scouts that won,” he then said abstractedly. The clamorous shrieking of the launch containing the blue-sweater fellows brought them out of their daze. Their scoutmaster had actually appeared and disappeared before them amid excited throngs here at this remote little village. Two of their own fellow scouts had, by almost superhuman effort, won a race before their very eyes. Yes, and those were the only two fellows in the troop who could have done it—save one. And now one of them had given out, and there was the final heat still to be raced. “These are our regulations,— There’s just one fate for the scout, And the hayseeds, too, And when we’re through They’ll look like _all get-out_!” sang the college boys, triumphantly, as they chugged about. Their boisterous, confident voices were greeted with laughter and cheers from the shore. Soon, their well-trained, crack oarsmen would come down the river, walking easily away from the scout crew, with its probably crude substitute. “I wonder how Red Deer got himself mixed up with those cracker jacks,” said Harry. “Harry, what’ll they do? They can’t put Nelson in—or Burt, either—it’s—” Gordon looked imploringly into his friend’s face. “Well, my boy,” said Mr. Danforth, clapping Harry on the shoulder, “where’s your voice? By Jove, that was a great victory! Why didn’t you cheer? Eh?” “He’s deducing,” said Miss Crosby. Harry turned suddenly. “Mr. Danforth,” said he, “those fellows belong to our own troop. Hanged if I know where they came from, but I—I—just can’t stand here and see them beaten after putting up a race like that.” The girl’s eyes were fixed intently on Harry. Gordon listened, his hand trembling on the rail. Down the course came muffled cheering, as the victorious shell, with its single oarsman, was towed back to the starting line. Then Miss Antoinette Crosby did a strange thing. She threw her arms around Mr. Danforth’s neck, and whispered to him, concluding by saying audibly, “Please, _please_!” That gentleman looked sharply at Harry, but said not a word. He walked across the deck, and called below: “Captain, steam up the course as quick as you can!” In a moment the yacht’s bow came around, and a score or more of little craft went scooting this way and that. Then her whistle sounded, dignified and melodious compared with the screeching and tooting about her, and she headed up the crowd-bordered lake. “Where are you going, sir?” came a voice from below. “Up the course.” “You can’t go up the course now, sir,” came from the patrol boat. “You’ll have to stay below the finish line—you were told that before.” “It’s a matter of great importance,” Mr. Danforth called. “Can’t help it. Fetch her round.” “Take her up, Captain!” ordered Mr. Danforth, firmly. “Clear out under there if you don’t want to be run into!” “What are they trying to do?” said a man in the judge’s boat, which came chugging up. “Here, bring that craft about! None of that!” “Ahoy there, below!” shouted Mr. Danforth’s captain. “Stand out from under if you don’t want to be run down!” The low, deep whistle sounded again, two gasoline dories chugged frantically backward, and the big white yacht, serene and heedless, steamed majestically up the course. “Didn’t I _tell_ you he _always_ has his own way?” said the girl, coming up to Harry, who still leaned dazedly over the rail. “_Now_ you are going to distinguish yourself—you’ve _got_ to—for _my_ sake!” “How did you know I wanted to take that fellow’s place, Miss Crosby?” “_Stupid!_” she said. “Do you think you’re the _only_ person that knows how to _deduce_?” “I’m afraid it’s a hopeless task, Miss Crosby. I haven’t been in training, you know. I’m all tired out, and they’re a pretty skillful pair—those college chaps—then—” “They’re an _insulting, conceited_ set—and their _poetry_ is at-ro-cious! You’ve _got_ to do it. You can beat them. I _know_ you can!” “Well, I guess that will help me to win, if anything can,” Harry said. “Here, Harry, my boy,” said Mr. Danforth, coming up. “No time to be standing around talking with girls now. Come down in the cabin, and we’ll see if we can’t root out a jersey or bathing suit that’ll fit you—we’ll be up there in a minute.” “Isn’t it _wonderful_! You’ve _found_ them at _last!”_ the girl said to Gordon when Harry had gone below. “And just to think, _I_ was here to _see_ you do it! And oh, I want _so_ much to see him row!” “You’ll see him row, all right,” said Gordon. “He can do most _anything_, can’t he?” “Yes—but he doesn’t know much about girls.” “Why, what makes you say _that_?” “’Cause he doesn’t. He doesn’t know as much as I do about them.” “The _idea_ of your saying _that_—he must know _lots_ of girls!” “He hasn’t had as much experience with them as I have—but, honest, there’s nothing he can’t do—honest.” “Tell me about him, won’t you? About the things he can do.” Would he! All was excitement on the float as the yacht steamed by, headed for the pier a few yards beyond. Evidently the oarsman who had collapsed was not in a serious condition, for there was Dr. Brent talking with one of the regatta committee. And there were Walden and Charlie Greer and Swift and Waring and “Brick” Parks, crowding about him. “Looks good to see Parks’s red head, doesn’t it, Kid? Don’t shout, now, just wait—it’ll only be a minute.” It was like an inspiration to both boys to see the familiar faces. A racing shell containing two boys waited at the float. Each had a blue sweater thrown over his shoulders. Another shell, empty, was moored hard by. The yacht made a landing and Harry went ashore, followed by Gordon. Miss Crosby stood at the rail watching them as they went over the side. “Remember,” she said, laughing, “it’s a scout’s _duty_ to _help others_. You see, I know the law!” The boys hurried to the float and for a moment stood on the edge of the little crowd, unobserved. “I’m sorry, sir,” said Dr. Brent. “There isn’t another oarsman I can put in. I thank you for your kindness, but I’m afraid it will have to go by default. You see, we’re not prepared for this kind of thing, anyway; we’ve already accomplished more than I expected.” “Nothing doing?” called one of the oarsmen in the waiting shell. “’Fraid not,” answered some one in authority. Several fellows in blue sweaters, armed with gigantic megaphones, set up a victorious howl. The Danforth yacht steamed gayly down the course. “Humph! All over. Those Welden chaps would win in a walk, anyway,” said some one near Harry. Then he heard the referee speak to Dr. Brent from his launch. “I’m going to start this crew down the course, sir, so that I can give them the decision; you are not prepared?” The expression rang in Harry’s ears. It was the scouts’ own motto. He pressed his way through the crowd and stood, face to face, with his scoutmaster and several members of the committee. “Yes, sir,” he said quietly; “we are prepared.” You could have knocked Red Deer down with a feather. As for Walden and Charlie Greer and “Brick” Parks—you should have seen them. Vinton, the Hawks’ corporal, stood gaping like an idiot. Then the sudden appearance of Gordon broke the spell and turned the whole thing into a laugh. “Did you come up in that yacht?” asked the astonished Red Deer. “Yes,” said Harry. “We’ve been tramping around the country, looking for you. How’s Mac—what’d he do, just faint? Hello, Burt, how’s everything? Morrel, you’ve got your octagon staff along, haven’t you?” “Do you wish to enter this fellow?” some one asked, while the crowd clustered about. “Will you try it, Harry?” asked the doctor. “What do you suppose we came up in a private yacht for?” asked Gordon, who, being, as you might say, mascot of the troop, enjoyed the special privilege of “talking up” to the scoutmaster. “There’s a magnet on that yacht.” “A what?” said Dr. Brent. “Magnate, he means,” said Harry. The sudden appearance of the substitute did not seem to produce much anxiety on the part of the blue sweaters. On the contrary, they regarded his advent as affording them an opportunity of winning when they would otherwise simply have had the race without earning it. The casual glimpse they had of him gave them a good deal of amusement. He wore an ill-fitting bathing jersey, his face had the tan of a countryman, and the loose stride with which he approached the shell, followed by Pierce, was not the stride of a trained athlete. There was no objection to his rowing when it became known that he was a member of the troop. As many of the scouts as their old boat would hold crowded in and made a bee line for the finish, Gordon among them, talking volubly. Harry looked the shell over as he and Pierce took their places. It was quite the sort of racing craft which one might expect to find in a country boathouse. It had two pairs of swivels, not very far from the sides, and was, indeed, little more than a narrow, attenuated skiff. Harry sat on the forward slide and for a few moments had some trouble getting Pierce’s stroke. He was the last one in the world to row jealous, but try as he would to accommodate his pulling to that of his partner, he inevitably rowed him around every few strokes. He could not fail to see that Pierce was well-nigh played out. The other shell was a full length in the lead, and gliding steadily along with a length and evenness of swing that were beautiful to see. The crowds cheered vociferously, and since both contestants were outsiders, there was no encouraging word for the second shell as it wriggled along. Harry knew enough of pair racing to know that the forward oarsman is not free, and having his doubts about Pierce’s vitality, he had wisely taken the forward slide so as to watch him. It soon became plain that he must accommodate himself to ragged and erratic work. Whenever Pierce swung short or took a slack beginning, Harry had to exert himself to correct his partner’s fault and hold the course. They managed to get together in a spurt just beyond the half flag, and sent their prow up to the second rower of the rival craft. But it soon lapsed into a series of pitiable swerves, leaving them a full two lengths behind. With a coxswain, of course, they might have done better, but as it was, their progress was little better than ridiculous. The shouting along the shore had an occasional note of hooting in it. “Let her run, Welden,” some one called derisively. “It’s all over.” “Those fellows came here aching for a race, and they haven’t had one yet,” shouted a sonorous voice. The college boys were now more than three lengths in the lead, moving like twin pendulums, with long, uniform, supple swings. Together their oars rose, together plunged dripping, and steadily, without a tremor, their shell glided forward. The leading shell was passing the three-quarters when Harry looked around. In his hasty glance, he saw the finish, the gay flotilla with its welcoming flags, the dense throng. He heard the premature tooting of distant launches. “Hit her up, old man,” he said; “careful, now, one—two—” It was no use. “Where are we?” asked Pierce, breathing heavily. “There’s the three-quarters flag. Are you all in? All right, old man—don’t try.” The disappointment in Harry’s voice could not be disguised, and it spurred Pierce to a frantic final effort. He leaned far forward, plunged his oar, made a long, steady stroke, then before he rose, a hand stole over his own and the oar was taken from him. “That’s all right,” said Harry, gently. “Sit steady, old man,—not going to keel over, are you?” Half-consciously, and with a feeling of utter relief, Pierce collapsed, his head hanging forward, his hands clutching the gunwale on either side. “That’s right,” said Harry. “Don’t lean back. I need the room. I’ll splash you when I get her going.” Pierce did not know what it was all about; he did not care, but he was vaguely conscious of ecstatic cheering and of a sudden dart forward. They were two racing oars that Harry had undertaken to manage—not a pair of sculls—which meant that there was a full two feet more length than a single arm was supposed to manipulate. He locked the oar into his own empty swivel. His lithe, slender form bent forward till it almost lay upon the prostrate figure before him. Then the quick, steady rise of his body, past the perpendicular, back till he seemed to lie prone. Then the quick, clean, firm lift of the dripping oars. Then the rapid, elastic recovery of his body, the long, well-balanced forward swing, accompanied by the straight reach of his arms. The shell glided forward under the impetus of this human machinery. Again and again, without the variation of the fraction of an inch in any move, the long pull was taken, and greeted with frantic howls from the shore. His hair blew about his head with a kind of wild picturesqueness, his movement was like an automaton—perfect, calm, indomitable. Presently, a perfect pandemonium of yelling and screeching rang in his ears. He glanced aside and saw that his prow was even with his rival’s forward slide. They were now within a few feet of the finish. He pulled another stroke, then splashed water over Pierce’s head, as he had promised. The rival oarsmen glanced at him, surprised, apprehensive. The launch with the other blue sweaters approached as near as allowed, her occupants shouting advice vociferously to meet this new turn of affairs. Their placard was not in evidence. Close in the rear, Harry saw the referee’s launch clipping along, as if awakened to sudden and necessary activity. He was vaguely conscious of the dense, surrounding throng, of carriages and autos crowded in the road, of canoes and dories packed tight at the water’s edge. He was desperate, but calm. He knew what he wished to do. He knew enough of the sport to know that the sculler has one advantage, that of spurting. Between contesting scullers, well-matched, the spurt at the right moment usually means victory. If he could keep this position through his rival’s “long stroke,” then he stood a chance. Presently, the order came. “Long stroke—hit her up!” shouted their coach from the motor-boat. They darted ahead, had their little spasm, and Harry remained exactly where he was before—his bow level with their second slide. They were close on the finish line. The screeching was deafening. “Hit her up, boys!” came a laughing mandate from the Welden launch. “Once more, hit her up, and let her run!” The judge’s dory swirled about to clear the way. You would not have thought that Harry could give a longer swing nor pull a more effectual stroke than he had been doing. Yet the shell, bearing the huddled and exhausted scout and its single oarsman, darted silently forward like a streak. Its prow lay even with the prow of the rival craft now. The boys in blue sweaters yelled frantically to their crew, but their cries and orders were drowned in the tumult. Again, and still again, the agile form swung forward. Again, and still again, the shell responded, cutting the still, sun-flecked water like a knife. Now she was half a length ahead. Then there was a sudden shake of his head as the oars dipped, and his hair flew loose. It was a sight for a painter. Throwing all his strength into the pull, uniting in a final effort the utmost power and reach of arm and body, he swung back, his head hanging in a kind of loose abandon from the exhaustion of the stroke. And amid the frenzied cheering and clamorous waving of hats and flags, he swept past the finish line. Just above him, as they brought the shell about, he could distinguish, amid the screeching of a score of boats, the deep, melodious whistle of the big white yacht. CHAPTER XX GORDON GOES UP IN THE AIR—ALSO HARRY “Hey, From eight in the evening, to eight in the morning. -But then you came back to theoretically settle in Brazil? No, I never wanted to stay in Brazil. But it was madness. The American got there with 10 dollars, I put it in my underwear, gave him the Brazilian money. Then I would go out, sell, and get a better rate. - Because those were times of high inflation. - The black market rate was high. It was very high. I was earning $ 10 thousand dollars a month. -Don't exaggerate. -Of course! I was there for one month. During the second period it decreased a little, I stayed fortwo months. Such was my eagerness to go to India. Looking back at the admiration that I always had forthe beatniks, the fascination for madness itself, I see that at that moment, despite still enjoying this literature, I could no longer stand it in my life. After a defeated revolution, I was trying to survive. No limits, no commitment, the excesses would be under control as from now. I distanced myself. We moved apart. Oh, I bought a ticket to the Pacific l spent two years in the Pacific. I bought a ticket. It was this thick. It wouldn't even fit in the stomach. Easter Island, Tahiti, Tonga, Fiji... Missionaries did not have an easy time here. They were killed, 11 Frenchmen who left the men in black somewhat apprehensive until the last century. But now the number is over 1100 (popular statistics not confirmed by the Brazilian Statistics Institute). kinds of Protestantism. And if I, for example, was to arrive here with my church " Last saint of the reincarnation of the 7th day of Heitor" the whole village would get together to build a temple, and everyone would chip in to buy the construction material. There's a marvellous film, I don't know if you have seen it. I think it was the first film everto have been made. Tapu. - By a German. - Tabu. Right, but in Melanesia, it's Tapu, with a p. Tapu. Dr. Mead's book about Samoan customs is really interesting, despite being now completely obsolete. But it's worth reading, because we can understand what is happening here nowadays. I feel very light here, walking around wearing a lava-lava and a t-shirt, but sometimes the children are a little excessive with their curiosity. Only missing lifted my lava-lava to see if mine is the same as theirs. If Tabu was a dream of the lost paradise, Margaret Mead was the beginning of my dream that was made possible. Whilst girls my age wanted to get married, I wanted to be an intellectual in Paris with many lovers. Like Simone de Beauvoir, of course, who in turn had women behind her like Margaret Mead. Based on extensive work carried out during the 20s with young Samoans, Mead concluded that the transition to adolescence in the Southern Seas was a lot easier and was not marked by emotional confusions as it was in the puritan US of the time. Herthesis served as a flag under which feminists acted in " the name of science" , demanding sexual liberty and equal rights. When 60's has arrived, nobody wanted to be housewives. While Heitortravelled the Southern Seas, I was working in my first movie and Miguel started his academic career. And as they all got happier the more I drank, I continued until reaching a state of languor, despite being totally lucid. When I thought the party was over, they began singing the most beautiful songs and everyone joined in, total liberty from 3 or4 voices, the perfect soul... It touched me profoundly. It made me feel like crying... I travelled through the Pacific islands wearing a lava-lava and barefooted. And a tiny case this size that mother gave me. -What was in the little case? A nail clipper, a handkerchief. Sydney. Things have changed a lot, particularly with regards to marriage. My friends from the time I spent in London are all married. Greg and Jemina expected another baby and they live in a cottage in the mountains. Now Robert is about to get married. After living with Gina for 2 years, who, by the way, is 5 months pregnant, they decided to get married next Sunday. -Did you not feel lonely? I felt somewhat distant from Robert who was my great friend. And did you neverthink about getting married...? -Oh, I had various opportunities, but I wanted to cross India by foot. Ants in my pants. That's an expression I love. But that is over, I don't even want to go to Petropolis. Santo Cristo is as far as I will go. I was as drunk as a skunk, but I didn't get much embarrassed. Ijust danced a little after drinking some tequilas. It was funny to see the London group back together again. People go through different experiences then it becomes difficult to communicate like back then. I've been feeling very heavy at times, maybe because I get the impression that people expect something from me. Or it might just be paranoia. But deep inside, I don't think so. -You say that you were always high. -What was it you were high on? It was mescaline. It was kept in the seam of my bag. That's where l kept a portion. I would remove it and cut a 1⁄4 ... I took communion every morning. And it would give me energy. Energy. -ln the Southern Seas. -What about in Australia? -Also. Bilpin, September, 1977. The most precious thing I have at the moment is my liberty. The certainty that I can leave any place without having to tell anyone. I wouldn't sell it for anything in the world. Well, I take back what I wrote, because every man has his price, even though I'm not for sale. This liberty that keeps me going, if I lost it now I would have no reason to carry on. I honestly don't know what it is, this liberty or longing for liberty. But I feed off the idea of it, it stimulates me, it makes me get out of bed on these cold mornings. It might be leading me to a total incapacity to get along socially. Solitude is difficult. They say that man is a purely social being. I'll put that to the test. -You said that you did that, right? You covered 13,000 km in 3 weeks in Australia. -You really didn't stop. - No, I didn't . -You did not see anything. - l saw the road. -So is walking the fun part? - On the road. The government here pays a pension to the Aborigines, that they immediately spend on booze, they get completely drunk while the women prostitute themselves. But the country goes ahead and keeps Australia in the future because there is plenty Uranium. Despite the protests, they will start exploring " No man's Land" as the Aborigines call the big fields of uranium. Many films about the Aborigines were made overthe last years. Stories of massacre, prejudice and isolation. The same sensation I had while filming in the Brazilian indigenous reserve, that the defeated culture is not able to survive decadence, alcohol and prostitution. But cinema does also provide alternative examples. Such as the fact that this Australian film that received a prize in Cannes, was made by a young Aborigine. By my calculations he was about 3 years old when Heitor crossed No man's Land. I left Port Hedland underthe difficult midday sun. After some sweating, an English engineer stopped in this jeep. He continued for 100 km then turned into a road in the middle of nowhere. I continued on foot. Afew kms further on, a white hydramatic stopped raising a typhoon of dust. The scottish looking bloke stuttered: " How is it doing, mate?" "Sure, mate." He was just finishing this 12th beer. He accelerated the old car up to 70 miles an hour saying that was the only way to avoid the bumps. " Good roads, hey mate?" Then stones appeared on the road, no idea where they came from, the moon maybe. He wrongly decided to brake and the car continued on two wheels, smoothly sliding overthe colourful sands of the Great Sandy Desert. The Ego and Self. One that grabs life with all its claws and the other wants to meet the eternal, the divine. These were highly schizophrenic seconds. Schizophrenia is not a disease and should not be treated clinically. It is nothing more than a greater susceptibility to the eternal, a life in ecstasy, like God gave Adam. -But the letters are very different to your memories, right? - They are all very straight and all... - lt's mother. All for mother. - But even to Miguel, wouldn't you send a letter describing what you were doing? -l used to tell Miguel everything. - But in a letter? - No. Miguel, I imagine that with all the work you have got, you must be finding it difficult even to pee. But as ourfriend said: " work ennobles, enriches and drives you mad" . I would like to write you a serious letter also, about my work, about the expansion possibilities. But there is a small detail that stops me from commenting. The fact that I'm not working at the moment. That's it, I can't imagine a more appropriate reason. So I should then write about my desire and search for the necessary hard work. But not even in this vague sentiment I can find enough concrete to cement these hard lines. So I will continue moving, lost, like a headless chicken. My father had already died when Miguel, who had the same name and profession, defended his master's thesis. In the dedication, the option for public health. To My Father and a group of friends that gave me the childhood dream of a romantic, beautiful and pure medicine. And for making me believe in the medicine as a fight gun in favour of the people. -This is it here... of the three of us. -A horrible beard. -You look like a guru there, don't you? -But it has been long ago, everyone has got black hair. -Black hair and Julia is a little baby. " Hi, Lucia. This is Miguel. I'm just calling to give you news about the appointment. All is well. Big hug." I'm just back from the post-office where l posted nine parcels, all to your address. Christmas gifts, but they will probably only arrive for Easter, or maybe next Christmas. They will probably get there in pieces, but that's ok. The important is the act. So that you know that I haven't forgotten about you. I would like you to tell me the gifts that arrive in one piece. Today I spent the whole day wondering around downtown Sidney, letting myself get carried away by the huge crowds. I was saying goodbye to the cities where people think they are protected by buildings. And people try to know in the stores the price of their own frustration. It's expensive, very expensive, but no problem because I'll work double as hard. I'll sell daddy's graduation ring, I'll pawn my own wife if necessary. But a beautiful young lady has just passed by, beautiful like only a bird from paradise can be. -At the end, after Australia you went back to India ... -l went to New Zealand... I worked hard... You cut it from the film, but I built a pumpkin shed with my own hands. - l was so proud. - lt was too long... You cut it, right? When I get down to work. I guess I could say that I'm now in the East. This time I'm arriving through the back door, slowly, as to avoid the cultural shock. These islands, The Moluccas, are the extreme point of the East. Turkey being the other extreme, the front door. I arrived peacefully without having to wait forthe boat. Forget the complications. I did it the easy way. I've still got some change and if I can reach India, that's fine. Ijust want to cross it on foot. End of story. Love, Heitor. Then I got to the Moluccas and was arrested. -Again? -Airforce. When I arrived at the prison it was a house with a sergeant serving me, in full uniform, giving me food. He thought I was some American spy, someone important. He approached and asked: "Do you read Playboy Magazine?" I replied: "l'd rather have a Koran" Then he... He smoked those clove cigarettes, one afterthe other using a whale tooth cigarette holder. One afterthe other, nervously. Ujung Padang, April, 1978. I haven't seen a white man for one week and I'm a lot taller then most. So I decided to go to Bali tomorrow, because this island is frequently visited by Australians, and I would no longer be the centre of attention. Then I went to Bali, where l had that marvellous Sat Chit Ananda moment. The blue meanies, I told you. -No you didn't. -Yes I did, and I will not repeat myself. -Please do, I can't rememberthe story. I got to Bali and there was a great fuss about a Japanese girl who had eaten 8 blue meanies and died. -What is a blue meanie? It's the most powerful mushroom in the world. It's a concentration of... I don't know... Goodness me, what is the substance called? I can't remember... what it contains. It's blue. Blue Meanie. Then I asked fortwelve and went to the beach, Everyone was naked... lt didn't hit. Then I went back the next day... They make omelettes. I asked for an omelette with 24. When I felt that they were going to hit, I climbed up the highest mountain and stayed there. Then I experienced the Sat Chit Ananda, the union of all things. But then night fell, the effect wore off and I returned to ego. Back to ego. Sat Chit Ananda, the union of all beings. Everything is part of a whole. You move your arm and the moon moves. Everything is connected. That's what the gurus are after. And I thought the drug could take me. Heitor was hospitalized forthe first time later, after his long journey. Miguel and I were against the idea. Until a psychoanalyst, whom I respected, said " Do you think I would let a patient jump out of a window or push someone? No, I don't." This question was left and it would always be there. A question that is impossible to answer : how could we be sure that the moment had arrived? Overthe next years, we were forced to decide when that moment arrives. And we required less evidence every time. Difficult balance. Certainty is impossible. It's a shame we are weak and that we have to ban drugs such as opium, that has incomparable medicinal value. Most old Chinese ladies use it to relax. But never mind, I'm not a doctor and as a human, I am easily induced to vice. I wouldn't like to end up like De Quinsey, using ten grams a day. Tell fatherthat I understand that he doesn't understand my letters, because I read them myself and I don't understand what I'm trying to say. Thomas De Quincey, "Memories of an English Opium-eater" . I adored that book. It starts like this: He intended to write about a mathematical theory that would revolutionize everything. It was all in his mind, but he was never able to write it down, only " Memories of an English opium eater" . It was the aspirin of the 19th Century. Have you ever read Sherlock Holmes? It was the aspirin of the 19th Century. Any use of drugs is seen as unnecessary or dangerous by a mother's love that is inflexible and egoistic. But I don't believe that I am in danger, because I love life. Opium is nothing more than the return to the mother's womb, the only place where we feel comfortable and warm. But I don't want to walk backwards. I want to move forward. There must be a larger womb that will shelter us all. This might be a topic that doesn't interest you, but it's part of Penang. It's like going to Rome and not seeing the Pope. Happy mothers day, even to all fathers. In Penang, which had Chinese settlers, I frequently visited the opium den. I loved the opium den. -Why? - Because of the Chinese man. He was about 90 or 100 years old. He was pure bone. And he had this pipe. It was a coconut with a 2-meter bamboo stick. He would lie down like this. And do this... And the bamboo stopped here. He would place the opium in the coconut and eat the rest, the left-over, the nicotine, whatever. He would eat it. He would eat nothing else. Bangkok. I met two Brazilians after one year without speaking Portuguese. Portuguese sounded good, well spoken by Lage and Lui, both from back at school and brilliant " young poets" . It's great to be called by your surname. I had forgotten the joys of old friends. And friendship, my friend, where is it? Back in the old days also. I have to travel alone. " One who travels alone, travels fast" . I got a 3 months visa for India, extensible for more 3 months. The minimum amount of time I want to spend. Afterthat I don't know and I hate who knows. I would like to say that I took a lot of hallucinogens, but never had an hallucination. -lt's that old story... -lt depends on what you consider a hallucination... I don't know if I'm a butterfly dreaming that I'm a man. If I'm a man dreaming that I'm a butterfly. I don't know. When Miguel can use science to help of his brother, he always does. That is how he -we - tried to avoid hospitalization. After mother died we took care of ouryounger brother. Heitor's first crisis while he was under our responsibility scared me. It's strange that Miguel was never afraid. When we arrived, after being called by the neighbours, or even by the police in serious situations, I would say: don't go in, he might do something, he's out of control. Miguel entered and said: "How are you, big boy?" He neverthrew the knife or any other object that he was holding, although he knew that after Miguel would come nurses and hospitalization, that none of us wanted. Sat on a wooden bench, ready to sleep my last Birmanese night. Tomorrow I'll be in India, God permitting. I'd rather not think about it because my hopes have been so high that I'm afraid of being disappointed. My dream of spending at least one year in the Indian sub-continent. But if it's only for one night I will be happy, because I will be ending my circumnavigation of 8 years of struggle. Then I reached Calcutta and the first thing I did was buy a brocade for mother. In the shop I was given two beers. And I thought they didn't drink. I got all happy. I pointed at a red and black brocade as mother was a Flamengo fan. He opened it, it was 3 meters long. Then I said: that's the one I want. I got it all wrapped up for mummy, I sent it and it arrived. She wore it at a wedding. Then I made cushions out of the dress. I left Calcutta, barefoot, wearing a thong and holding your little bag. I carried on until I reached a little village, a French colony. I can't rememberthe name. Then the priest, an Indian who spoke fluent French, said: you will not succeed. Many mosquitoes. Then I got malaria, yellow fever, the lot. Then he put me in a train to Benares. I got there suffering from a very high fever. It's dirty, cows have to defecate. And not only cows, but goats, monkeys, mongooses. All mixed up with an indescribable mix of people. Believe me, mother. It is a madhouse. There was a time in the 60s when madness had its charm, like a synonym for liberty. I always thought that to go mad after being tortured was more dignified. Anti-psychiatry was part of this world, our understanding of anti-psychiatry. We wanted the cure of the diseases without authoritarian interventions. Now I will get lost in the hermetic book by Dr. Laing about anti-psychiatry. Dr. Laing ended up in Ceylon meditating 17 hours a day. And I ask myself how I will end up. I've been sitting here for two days writing letters. I leave the room to eat and then rush back. I started writing this letterto my mother, but after starting it, I remembered that I had already written herthis morning. So I decided to write anyway, because these are the last two pages in this pad. I have had it with me for about two months and I've used it as a pillow. I've still got a lot of walking to do round here. And when I start feeling at home, I go home. -And could you not stay in Benares? - No. No Lucia, contingencies, right? I know you have nothing to do with what I take or what I don't take. I take care of my health the way I learnt and how my frustrations allow. I nevertried to convince you to turn into a hippy orto settle in some commune. I sent you those leaflets of the theosophical society simply to show you something I found interesting to learn English. Orto fold up and use to line the birdcage. Brazil scares me. I want to spend at least a year here. The hospitalizations were many. Heitor did not want to be medicated. But years later, in the midst of a very painful hospitalization, We decided to accept the medication that he best adapted to, with all the side effects that one day we thought we could avoid. He was never again hospitalized. And the three of us started living with the side effects. It probably wasn't the best choice, but it's what we could. I wanted to meet Swami. I wanted to stay in India. Neverto return anywhere. August, 4th, 1978. The last bye-bye to Benares, because tomorrow I depart to Delhi to arrange a visa for Nepal where l would like to spend one month. Then in Nepal l lost my passport... And I returned on foot to New Delhi. - From Nepal to Delhi? -With no passport. - There's a border, right? A border where Buddha enlightened himself. Where the Buddha was born. He enlightened himself in Bodhgaia. In December 1978, we received a note from the government, informing us that the Brazilian Embassy in New Delhi had hospitalized Heitor because he had lost control, and that he could only return with a member of the family. My mother went to collect him. India frightened her. The fact that Brazil also has a great number of poor areas did not make any difference. The social reality did not matter, only the feeling that her son was being stolen by that society. And if my brother was the only one at the Brazilian Embassy, at the American Embassy, or lost somewhere around it, over 80 youngsters were kept waiting for a western solution. It had been a long journey for each one of them. -And how did you look for Swami? You found him, right? During the first trip I did... ln Rishkeshi... You find him, you have to. When the disciple is ready, the masterfinds him. That is what the tradition says. I neverfound him. Well that's it, it's over. What to do in the face of death otherthan cry uninterruptedly? Fragile, lost, we try to remember everything that happened when it was still the three of us. For Miguel. I went around the world. That is why I'm slightly crazy. I went round the world twice. That should not be done. You lose track of time. (Male announcer) Previously on Hell's Kitchen... Food service my ass! (Announcer) After an embarrassing opening-night dinner service...

Even just to look at her makes me want to sock her. I just want to... Unh! (Announcer) And will's perfectly cooked meat... (Gordon) You cooked the burger medium-well. Beautiful. Bye-bye, girls. Bye-bye. (Announcer) Clinched the victory for the men's team. Congratulations. (Announcer) At dinner service... Come on, ladies, let's go. (Announcer) Carrie continued to struggle... Carrie... How can we be backed up with a Caesar salad? (Announcer) And Elise's big mouth... Let's go, ladies. Ten minutes till the window. Ten minutes? Ten seconds. (Announcer) Got her in big trouble with Chef Ramsay. Stop pointing at me like I'm some picture! Thank you, Chef Ramsay, for shutting up Elise. (Announcer) In the blue kitchen... Where's the risotto? (Announcer) Chino screwed up the risotto... Another burnt risotto. Burnt! (Announcer) And Brendan... Is that the same bass? No, Chef. So where's the old one, then? Threw it away, Chef. Show me. (Announcer) Got caught in a lie. I'm gonna ask you one more time-- is that the bass from ten minutes ago? Yes. (Announcer) Which infuriated Chef Ramsay so much... You, you, you, you, you... (Announcer) That he kicked all of the men out of the kitchen. Get the [bleep] out of here. Get out! (Announcer) The women completed the blue team's orders... Ladies, well done. Hell yeah! (Announcer) And the men lost their second dinner service in a row, and nominated... (Gordon) Brendan. And... (Gordon) Chino, step forward. I'm disappointed. (Announcer) Chef Ramsay ended the night with an easy decision. Brendan, give me your chef jacket. (Announcer) Dashing Brendan's hopes of being head chef at BLT Steak in New York City. But Chef Ramsay wasn't done. Ladies, we've only seen men leave the building. I need to hear from a volunteer who will go to the men's team. ♪ Hell's Kitchen 9x03 ♪ Original Air Date on July 25, 2011 "The Ohio Players' "Fire" " ♪ Fire ♪ ♪ woo woo woo woo ♪ ♪ the way you walk and talk ♪ ♪ really sets me off to a full alarm, child ♪ ♪ yes, it does ♪ ♪ the way you squeeze and tease ♪ ♪ knocks me to my knees ♪ ♪ and I'm smoking baby ♪ ♪ the way you swerve, curve ♪ ♪ really wrecks my nerves ♪ ♪ and I'm so excited, child ♪ ♪ when you're hot, you're hot ♪ ♪ you really shoot your shot ♪ ♪ you're dynamite, child ♪ ♪ yeah ♪ ♪ the way you push, push ♪ ♪ lets me know that ♪ ♪ you're good-ood-ood ♪ ♪ you're gonna get your wish ♪ ♪ oh, no ♪ ♪ fire ♪ == sync, corrected by elderman == (Announcer) And now, the continuation of Hell's Kitchen. I didn't come out here to be embarrassed, man. Monterray, I agree with you, bro. It hurt my pride a little to have Chef Ramsay say that he feels that us, as the blue team, we needed some help. If we do succeed next shift because another person from another team came over, that's the [bleep] thing about it. Look, whoever comes, she's part of our team. I have no problems with anybody coming over. I'm tired of getting my ass kicked. She's [bleep] blue, she's blue. So what are we gonna do? I was thinking about it. I'm tired of the drama. And I'm not saying that you're drama or you're drama. But we all [bleep] know that this combination right here-- I can't stay in this dynamic anymore. It Carrie and Elise do not get split up, that will be the downfall of the red team. I don't want to go, and I'm not. You two not getting along is an issue. He said a volunteer. I really want to go. I see it as an opportunity for one of us to step up. I really want to go too. Damn, that really takes away from our team. You two are very strong in the kitchen. We're all competing against each other anyway. You're either gonna prove yourself, or you're not. Exactly. I mean, seriously. I was thinking about it, but I don't know. I have an idea. If you want to go, then I won't go. If Jamie won't go... Now, are you behind me on that? Yeah. I wanted to go on the blue team, but everybody knows that this was the best solution that could possibly happen. All right, it's easy. Done. I volunteer. I just haven't had, really, a chance to shine. And I think this is my time to step up and do it. Plus, I enjoy working with guys. I'm gonna come out smelling like roses. Carrie's going. Okay. Done. (Announcer) With the big decision behind them, the women and the men settle into a peaceful slumber. But early the next morning, Chef Ramsay has arranged for a raucous slumber party. [Bicycle horns honking] Aah! I don't like clowns. Clowns are freaky. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut the [bleep] up. [Bleep]. [Indistinct comments] That's the wrong way to wake me up. Get the [...] Out of here, bro. [Bicycle horns honking] Come on, quick. Chef Ramsay feels that since you cook like a bunch of clowns, you might as well be woken up by a bunch of clowns. Apparently, we're all a bunch of clowns. A stunning metaphor. My mind has been blown. Today, in the challenge, there's a very special ingredient. Out front, there is a truck full of Stonefire naan bread that needs to be unloaded and brought in immediately. Okay? Let's go. Everybody outside. Okay, right inside. Line 'em up in the kitchen. I'm a sandwich guy. I love Stonefire naan bread, dude. I'm curious to see what we're gonna do with a crap-load of naan bread. Right. Good morning. All: Good morning, Chef. Look at all those red jackets. It's like an army there. So, ladies, who's volunteering? I am, Chef. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. The person joining the blue team will be Carrie. It's not you. Natalie. Yes, Chef. We just lost a good member of our team. This sucks! This is awesome. For Chef Ramsay to pick me, that shows me that he knows that I can step up. What do you think you can bring to the blue team to make a difference? I was over in their kitchen a little bit last night, and I think there's some organizational skills lacking. Maybe we can pull together and really make it happen. Love the attitude. Will, you make it look painful. It's nothing personal against any of the girls, but it sucks. I've never had anyone say that to me before in my entire career in the kitchen. To have that happen in front of you, that's what hurts the most. I do not want anybody that was not on our team originally on our team now. But Chef Ramsay's gonna do what Chef Ramsay wants to do, and the only thing we can do is roll with it. Right, now... I think our guests are arriving. They are very hungry. You gotta be [bleep] kidding me, bro. [Bleep]. I don't do clowns, Chef. (Gordon) Have a good look behind the clowns, because today you'll be cooking an extraordinary lunch for children. Aw... Oh... [Applause] (Gordon) Ladies, welcome. This is your next challenge. When I seen the moms and the kids coming in, I got that fire inside of me. Because that's why I'm here, for my four babies. I'm getting a little teary-eyed now, you know. I definitely miss my babies. First team to feed their diners wins the challenge. Let's get into the kitchens. Let's go. (Announcer) In today's mommy and me challenge... Who's doing bechamel? Carrie is. (Announcer) The chefs must first serve pasta and chicken quesadillas to 50 hungry children. I'll cook the chicken if you can find some tortillas. (Announcer) Once all the kids have been served, the chefs must prepare panini sandwiches for 50 mothers, utilizing the naan bread from today's delivery. We're gonna eat some food. (Announcer) The first team to serve their side of the dining room wins the challenge. Are you hungry? Well... They're gonna bring you some food soon. Right, ladies, first order in. Here we go. One quesadilla, one bowl of pasta for the children. That goes first. Let's go. All: Yes, Chef. Quesadillas. I need somebody on quesadillas right now. Got it. I'm over losing challenges. We have to win this one. Where are we going with this? Blue team, here we go. Away first, one quesadilla, one bowl of pasta for the children. All: Yes, Chef. Me, personally, I feel a lot of pressure in this challenge. Because as a team, we suck. This is [bleep]. Pick it up! I feel like we need the win. Let's go, guys. Bang it out. (Announcer) Both teams are off to a fast start. Quesadillas. Very hot. Thank you. (Announcer) And within 20 minutes, each kitchen has fed half of their hungry children. Convection oven's on. I'm gonna put it in now? Yeah. Can I flip it? Do you want to get a new one started? You think that's okay? I can't believe Jamie's going to serve a burned quesadilla. It's not gonna be good. Where's the quesadilla? It's burnt. They're children! Ladies! Ladies, come here! All of you! Would you serve that to your baby? No, Chef. No, Chef. Unbelievable. Jamie, stop sulking like a [bleep] baby! The babies are out there, not in here! Start again. [Bleep] [Bleep]. (Announcer) While Jamie is making her little diners wait... [Crying] You hungry? I'm starving. (Announcer) In the blue kitchen, Natalie is determined to push her new team ahead... I've got two more coming at you, Will. (Announcer) And get out the last of their kids' plates. What's your time on the chicken, Monterray? Chicken is in. Two minutes. 2 1/2 at the most. How about pasta? Natalie, give me four-- four minutes. Four minutes, guys. Nice job, Natalie. Okay, I've got you on quesadillas. We finally [bleep] Started communicating. And you know why? Because we got Natalie over on the team. How are we looking, guys? How long? Chef Ramsay knows what he's doing 100%, man. You got peppers on there yet? Yes. (Gordon) Service, please. Last quesadilla. Did we get the panini? Yes, Chef. Last quesadilla, guys. (Gordon) Go. Table two. Let's go. (Announcer) 30 minutes into the mommy and me challenge, the teams are virtually tied, having served all of the children in the dining room. Three chicken panini, one ham, three sweet potato fries. Yes, Chef (announcer) Now the race is on to get the mothers fed. We need three chickens, one ham--let's go. Here. We need some over here. We can't be keep crossing over each other, Carrie. You're running around frazzled. I'm not running around frazzled. I'm trying to get this [bleep] done. We already been assigned paninis. I'm doing the chicken, Carrie. You can cut. You can cut. We need to be organized. I consider Elise like a little yip-yip dog. She just kind of bip bip bip bip bip bip at your feet, and you just kind of kick her away, you know. How 'bout I'll cut it over here? She's not [bleep] listening. How's that? How 'bout I cut it over here? The girl's not listening. I'm trying to get the [bleep] done. I'm frustrated with Carrie. I hate her. She runs around the kitchen like a chicken with her head cut off. [Panting] Breathing and all that. Nobody needs that. Looks like there's [bleep] missing. This is not-- Carrie made this one. That's the one I made. I did not. Carrie made that one. Get rid of that [bleep]. Excuse me. Elise, I made that one right there and I set it right there. Get away from me, Carrie! (Announcer) While the red team wastes time arguing... I need a ham on the fly! I need a ham yesterday! I'm making it now. Thank you. Two chicken, one ham, one veg. (Announcer) The blue team's newfound chemistry is paying off. (Natalie) Let's go, guys. We're kicking ass. (Announcer) And they now have the lead. You've got a very small lead. Keep it going. Yes, Chef. Go! Slide 'em up there. Service, please. Table one. Table one. Thank you. Ladies, the guys are flying out now. Come on! Chicken! (Will) It's like a back and forth battle with us and the red team. We're so close right now. We gotta pick up the pace. Let's do this! Two tables left. Let's go. Right now. Excuse me, Chef. Unbelievable. All of you, just stop. Look at me! Look at me! [Children crying] (Announcer) For Chef Ramsay's teamwork challenge, the chefs are cooking lunch for a dining room full of hungry children and their mothers. The blue team has got two tickets left, ladies. You've got three. Let's go. (Announcer) And both teams are racing to the finish. Excuse me, Chef. (Gordon) All of you, just stop! Look at me. Look at me! There's no chicken in here. I mean, do you think I'm gonna push that out? You've got a small lead, but it's shrinking away. Start the table again! All: Yes, Chef. Guys, use every single little bit of chicken we have. A nice, even layer, man. Oh, man, that burned my ass, man. I need the paninis. 30 seconds to the window. You're griddling paninis, you know what I'm saying? It ain't rocket science. Good luck. Good luck, guys. Come on, we're so close, I'd like to take it away from them. Table four. Quickly. There we go. (Gordon) Send the chicken. Let's go. Last table. Two veg panini. Let's go! Guys, pick it up! (Natalie) Come on, come on, come on. Fast, fast, fast. Talk to each other. Talk to each other. They're on their last ticket, and so are you. Come on, come on, Carrie. I've got a veggie right here, Chef. Is that it? Go. Service, please. Blue team, congratulations [blue team cheering] I really wanted to go to the blue team. I really did. That was the first time we actually communicated, bro. Welcome aboard, baby! Welcome. One, two, three... All: Blue! Credit's given where credit's deserved. Natalie came in-- she's a rock star. Natalie, that's awesome. It's what I do, boys. We need to come back together as a team. (Elise) At the same time we have to look at our weakest links too because that's gonna cause us problems at dinner service. Why are you in my space? I'm not in your space. Back up. You're in my space. This is my personal space. I'm like a foot away. Your mouth is one of the issues, Carrie. You following people around and walking around doing [bleep] Is one of the weakest issues. Jamie, I thought I was actually helping out. No. Find a station and man it! All right. All right, fine. That's it. (Gordon) Guys, line up. Let's go. All: Yes, Chef. Okay... Blue team, job well done. You know, if I'd have known it was that easy to bring a beautiful lady in to get everybody talking, I'd have had Tommy put a dress on, man. [Laughter] Okay, today you're gonna have a lot of surprises. I don't want to give it away now in front of the girls. It would be unfair. So run upstairs and change into something a little bit more comfortable. Okay? Get out of there. [Scattered cheers] Ladies, where did that spirit go? How can you lose it? Is it because you lost your lucky charm in Natalie? All: No, Chef. I will say, Chef, I feel like Carrie ran around the kitchen today like a chicken with her head cut off... Oh, my God. And didn't know where she should go, what she should do. 'Cause we were neck and neck, and we could have won this challenge easily with our eyes closed. I was trying to, like, get everything out. I was doing everything I can because I want to make it perfect. I wouldn't send out a half-assed sandwich or anything like that. It's just like she's-- both of you need to shut up. That's what needs to happen. Stop. Shut your mouths. Both of you. (Jamie) Stop talking. Unbelievable. Carrie--all right. Okay, just leave it. Okay, you're gonna be spending a little time together today figuring it out. First of all, look at the state of my dining room. What a mess. Ugh. I want my dining room pristine. Ready. Off you go. All: Yes, Chef. God, this is a disaster. Like, how did I end up with this team that can't put their differences aside when it's all of our asses on the line? Kids are disgusting. Kids are nasty. Gross. The restaurant was disgusting. I can't understand how kids can be that messy. My son is three years old and was never that messy. [Vacuum rattling] There's something in the vacuum. [Turns off vacuum] I don't know how this [bleep] thing works. Carrie is worse than useless. Something not up here. You broke the vacuum. [bleep] dang it. I feel a little bad for Carrie. Everybody's got this tainted image of her. [Sighs] And once you get somebody in your radar, every single thing that they do you're gonna criticize. It never fails. [Vacuum rattling] I don't like punishment. (Announcer) While most of the red team goes medieval on Carrie... Whoo! (Announcer) The blue team is in for some medieval fun. Welcome to the splendors of Medieval Times. Yeah! All right. [Neighing] Medieval Times. Oh, my God. It's getting to sit and eat a big-ass turkey leg and watch people fight. [Cheering] Stab him in the heart! Go, blue knight! Don't take that [bleep] from him, kick his ass! Uhh! Yeah! Haaaa! Oh... Yeah! I'm a kitchen warrior. I got my battle-ax, I got my--my shield. Like, I'm really, really enjoying myself today. Yeah, blue knight! It just keeps getting better. We not only got to watch a sword fight, but we got to do it ourselves, man. Point your sword out in front of you, just like this. (Jonathon) That [bleep] was cool. I mean, there was literally [bleep] sparks flying. (Announcer) As the blue team's reward gets better and better, the red team learns that their punishment is not just limited to cleaning. I'm sick of this crap. (Announcer) It also includes setting up for family night, which is tomorrow night at Hell's Kitchen. Oh... (Elise) Great. We're going to be assembling a playground. Another team-building exercise, ladies. Good job. And of course, Carrie the mouth was, like, "uh..." [Speaking gibberish] You think a couple of us should get started on that? Yeah, can we do that? Come on, Elizabeth. I thought the best thing to do was put together the biggest project-- the swing set. Push forward. But for some reason, Krupa, Elizabeth, and Carrie put together the basketball net, which is, like, three pieces. Turn that way. All right. Pull. [Exasperated sigh] It is really stuck good. How'd we get it stuck so good? Ha, ha, ha! [Laughter] Victory for the blue team! When the wenches are finished with the day's work, please bring me a flagon of mead. Them acting like fools, I wanted to turn around and swing at one of them. What are y'all ladies building? Do we get to play with this later? No. That's a lot of instructions for a slide. Ladies, enjoy building stuff. We shall go be drunk and merry. [Laughter] (Announcer) After a long day of pleasure for the blue team and pain for the red, the teams settle in to discuss their plan for the next dinner service. Natalie, what do you want to bring to the table that's gonna help up win this service, based on what you guys did? Give us the scoop. The reason why we did dinner service so good the other night is because we had everything set up on point. Yeah. We would make out lists for every station. I'm taking all the advice I can get from Natalie right now, you know, because she was with the red team. They [bleep] blasted us out in the past two dinner services. If we set up the stations and we keep a constant communication, that's all we need to do. (Announcer) While the blue team works out their plan of action, the red team is hatching a strategic plan of their own. Think about it logically. What are we gonna do with Carrie doing dinner service? Especially if she's assigned to a hardcore station. Help me come up with a solution. I don't know. That's the only thing-- that's--I don't know. What did she do today? She made bechamel sauce. Not even made it from scratch. What else? All right, good point. You want to know what I did? Yes, I heated up the bechamel sauce. Then I went over and I helped you with the quesadillas 'cause that would get things done faster. Why do you have an attitude with me? I don't have an attitude with you. I'm just--God! Stop with the attitude. I don't have an attitude. I was giving you attitude, and you were-- excuse me. I didn't even say anything. They said it! Did you not pop off-- they said, "What did she do?" They said it! Excuse me. (Announcer) At the end of a long and punishing day for the red team... They said, "What did she do?" (Announcer) Jamie's irritation with Carrie has reached a boiling point. I didn't say a [bleep] word. You popped off and said I put onions in it. So you shouldn't be giving me any attitude. [Bleep] damn it, Jamie. Carrie is creating all these problems, and that's what's fracturing the team. If she can't get it together, we're screwed. This is going to be a problem. She's got something wrong. Pppbbbt. (Announcer) Tonight is family night in Hell's Kitchen. Meat's doing good over here, guys. (Announcer) And while the red team is hoping to repeat their successful last dinner service in Hell's Kitchen, the blue team is hoping to claim victory like they did yesterday in the mommy and me lunch. These garlic and shallots are done. Prep is going very smooth. Everyone's in sync. That's the number one step to victory, boys. (Announcer) While the blue team's communication has reached a new high, the red team's communication. Who needs confit garlic? (Announcer) Has hit a new low. (Krupa) Prep seems to be going good. The red team is not fighting. Anybody? I mean, what better way to avoid a drama than not talking? No? (Announcer) The most popular night in Hell's Kitchen is family night. Are you clear on what you're doing tonight? (Announcer) To ensure that this hectic evening runs smoothly, Chef Ramsay has dispatched Chino and Gina to assist James in the dining room. James, Gina, and Chino, open Hell's Kitchen, please. Yes, Chef. You're right here, ladies. (Announcer) For tonight's dinner service, in addition to the regular menu, Chef Ramsay has added a kids' menu that includes chicken tenders, burgers, and spaghetti. Chicken fingers? Spaghetti? Okay. I've got three entrees. (Announcer) Each table will also be served a welcoming margherita pizza. Order in. Order in. So what does that say there? Help me understand that. It's a margherita. One chicken tender, one beef Wellington, and what's that? Kid cheeseburger. And no sides? Did you offer them sides? Uh, no, I didn't, Chef. Oh, piss off, Chino! Chef Ramsay was busting my [bleep] For not writing legibly. And I don't know. I'm completely discombobulated. Here you are, Chef. Two appetizers, three entrees. Is that right? Yes, Chef. Very nice. Red team, we're off. Two risotto, one Caesar salad, one cioppini. Yes, Chef. Let's go, guys. I'm gonna do the best that I can. I'm on my "a" game, and I can get us off to a racing start. Check the bottom. Good. Salad please. Nice pizza, Elise. Thank you, Chef. Margherita pizza away. Table 30, please. (Announcer) While Elise gets the red team off to a good start, the blue kitchen is still waiting for Chino to deliver an order. Chino. Chino. [Yelling] Chino! Chino, let's go. Time's of the essence, so it's go time. Gotta go. Gotta go. Ticket for 21-- chicken tenders, squab salad. Entree-- beef Wellington. Holy crap. Finally, he's written the ticket out. All right, blue team, margherita pizza. One chicken tender, one squab salad. Entree--one beef Wellington, one spaghetti for the children. All: Yes, Chef. Give me a time on that first margherita. Two minutes, Chef. Good. Let's go. (Announcer) As jonathon gets the blue team's first pizza going, in the red kitchen, Krupa's ready to deliver her first appetizer. (Gordon) Risotto, where is it? Krupa. Yes, Chef. All right, I'm walking with the risotto. You guys ready? Yeah. I need that squid asap! Blue team, you may be winning every [bleep] Challenge that comes along, but we're winning the important stuff. Who made that risotto? I did. Thank you, Chef. It's delicious. Yeah, we're gonna kick ass tonight! (Gordon) Oh, my God! Amanda! What is going on over there? Elise. Yes, Chef. I knocked over the sauce. Amanda is very frazzled. It is super frustrating to me because I'm really sick, at this point, of babysitting people. Oh, my gosh. [Hissing] (Announcer) 45 minutes into dinner service... (Gordon) Service, please. (Announcer) Appetizers are flying out of the red kitchen. And the blue kitchen is looking to Tommy... Two chicken tenders. (Announcer) To get them off the ground. Chicken finger, are you up or no? Good. Bring 'em. Are they burnt? They're burnt, bro. [Bleep]. More chicken fingers down now. Two chicken tenders. You think that's burnt? You wanna serve it, bro, you [bleep] Bring it to him. Guys, I'm dying here. Tommy! Two tenders, Chef. They're overcooked and they're [bleep] Dry. Tommy, come here. Come here! I know they're children, all right. I've got four of my own. Would you serve them that [bleep]? It's like a [bleep] Baby's flip-flop! Oh, piss off, will you! Come on, quality product, Tommy. Piss off. (Announcer) While Tommy's overcooked tenders keep families on the blue side waiting... Where's my food? Where's my food? (Announcer) The red team, led by Krupa and Jamie, has completed their appetizers, and Chef Ramsay is looking to Carrie and Jennifer to keep the momentum going with the entrees. Okay, first entree. Two sea bass, one lamb, two New York strip, one cod. Six minutes to the window. All: Yes, Chef. Wake up, Carrie, Jennifer. Let's go! I am not a Carrie hater, but I am not looking forward to working with her on the meat station tonight. Are we sure there's a burger on this? Yeah. One Wellington, one cheeseburger. Correct? Yes. Jennifer, what proteins do you have right now? One Wellington, one lamb, two strips... And a burger. Okay, two strips. So I have polenta right here. Let's go, guys. Right behind. Just put it down. (Jennifer) Why do we have a kids' burger? It's not even on the ticket. Neither is the Wellington. All of you, come here! It's the first [bleep] Ticket of the night. Two bass, two New York strip, one lamb, one cod. [Bleep]. No burger, no Wellington. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Your first ticket. Jennifer, this is embarrassing! Half the dining room is filled with children. Pathetic! (Announcer) It's family night in Hell's Kitchen, and after a strong start... Service, please. (Announcer) Carrie and Jennifer's mistake on the first set of entrees has put the brakes on the red kitchen. No burger, no Wellington. Your first ticket. Jennifer, this is embarrassing! I'm mortified that I was even a part of this. I will not go down for Carrie. I should have just pushed her away and had her do something else. Start again. Both: Yes, Chef. (Announcer) While the red team stumbles... Now's your chance to get ahead. Yes, Chef. (Announcer) The blue team has completed appetizers, and now they're ready to get started on their first entrees. Okay, let's go. Yes, Chef. Two chicken tenders, one cod, one lamb, one Wellington. One strip, one kids' spaghetti. Yes, Chef. You also have a zucchini and a broccolini on that dish. Get your broccolini going now, get your spinach going. Get everything in your [bleep] pans, and let's rock! Tommy, he ended up messing up on appetizers, so after that, I was-- me, personally, I wasn't gonna have none of that. Chef, I'm reading this right here-- turn around and put the [bleep] food back. These are solo chicken... So if I have to work fish and garnish at the same time, I'm gonna do what I have to do. If you guys [bleep] me on this fish, man, I'm gonna be pissed! I'm tired of losing. (Tommy) Dude, I'm sorry, bro... Don't say sorry to me ever, bro. Just [bleep] do it, man. You got it. Will's great at calling out and getting everybody on focus. Tommy, five [bleep] potatoes, bro. I wanted to say, "get away and leave me alone-- I'm not an idiot." But it was much-needed help. What's the ketchup for? Next time you start giving me stuff I don't need, I'm just gonna throw it at you. Yes. (Announcer) Thanks to a very vocal will, the blue team's first entrees are leaving the kitchen. As for the red team, they are now ready with the second attempt on their first entrees. I'm ready. I'm ready. Is it ready? You guys, I'm ready. Anybody else? I'm ready. You ready? I'm ready. Somebody send it then! Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef. (Gordon) Let's go, New York strip. Let's go, fast! Right behind. The garnish is there. I have one. Is the other one behind? Right behind it, Chef. It's gonna come back. It's raw. I don't-- should I put it in the oven? Put it in the oven. Put it in the oven. Come on, let's go. Hurry up. Let's go, Amanda. Come on, girl, you got this! Where's the two bass? Two are in the oven. Where's the sea bass? Two are in the oven. Amanda! Yes, Chef. How long for the first two bass? Three minutes, Chef. It's raw. I didn't cook it. Three minutes? She said it should be, like, one more minute. That's because you didn't sear it good enough, and you-- okay, you don't need to yell at me. I'm already getting yelled at by the Chef. Why the [bleep] are you yelling at me? Let me cook the [bleep] food. I'm not yelling. I'm just telling you so you don't do that again with that one. Stop. Stop! All of you! There's nothing happening, Amanda! I'm sorry, you guys. (Announcer) While Chef Ramsay and some children are still waiting on the red team's first entrees, over in the blue kitchen... Two Wellington, one lamb, one strip, two burgers. All: Yes, Chef. Let's go, Natalie. (Announcer) All eyes are on Natalie on the meat station. You got everything going? Yeah. We're waiting on you. Natalie, you drive the ticket, right? It's in, everything's in. You're just waiting. I'm just waiting, yeah. It's go time. Natalie should be coming out with fire out of her [bleep] eyes. Oh, my gosh, it's raw. It's raw? They're not cooking how they're supposed to. (Announcer) While the blue kitchen waits on Natalie's Wellingtons, the families on the red side are hoping food will be coming their way in the near future. What's going, Amanda? I'm sorry, Chef? What's going? I have two bass on this ticket, Chef, with a lamb. And a cod. And a cod? And a cod. The cod's not on? The cod is not on, Chef. What? I forgot about it. Oh, my God! Amanda... Is there anyone home? (Gordon) You haven't got the cod on? I forgot about it. [Strained chuckle] Ugh! It's family night... Disaster night! I'm sorry, Chef. [Utensils clang] You're gonna be up on that chopping block if you don't get it together, girl. I look over, I see Amanda, and she is just absolutely blank stare. She's a deer in headlights. She's shutting down by the second. I'm sorry for letting you guys down. Amanda... Yes, Chef. Fight back! Yes, Chef. For God's sake, woman, get some dignity! It's our first table. (Announcer) While Amanda holds up the red kitchen, the blue kitchen's still waiting on Natalie. I'm just running behind on those Wellingtons. Natalie... Wake up! (Natalie) Right now I feel like the spotlight's kind of on me. I need to step up, or I'm gonna fall on my face. Natalie, driving, how long? One minute. One minute. Thank you. Let's go, Natalie. Yes, Chef. Coming up with two Wellingtons. Behind, behind. Two Wellingtons, Chef. (Gordon) Natalie, good job. Go. Beef Wellington. (Announcer) With Natalie back in her groove, families on the blue side are enjoying their meal. That's good stuff. Yummy, huh? (Announcer) But the families on the red side continue to wait. Ah... How much time now? We're waiting on the lamb. Are you standing there with your hands on your hip while we're trying to put this ticket out? No, I am not. I better see you cooking something! Elise is always yelling at me. See what I mean? I'm not gonna let her get to me. I know I can cook. I know I'm good. How long till window? We have one more minute. Please, let's get it up. Garnish. Let's go. Here we go. 30 seconds to window. Yes, Chef. Where's the bass? It's coming up right now. Service. Where's the lamb? It's right here, Chef. Let's go. (Gordon) Garnish, please. Look at this. Oh, [bleep], it's raw! Is it still raw? Come on. And it's walking. No, it's right there. You gotta be kidding me, guys! No, that's--that-- okay. Stop. Leave me alone! All of you, come here. Look at the [bleep] state of this! I thought it looked good. I honestly think that Carrie doesn't have all her marbles. Why are you doing this to me? I saw this, and I thought it was okay, Chef... "I saw this." It's not even hot. It's raw. Raw! [Bleep]! Gina, please. Yes, Chef. Take this useless brigade around every [bleep] table, and I want a sincere apology on the back of your crap performance! Piss off! Every one of them. [Bleep]. Why don't you explain to this table? Could you look at all these children. They're all famished. We sincerely apologize about your entrees. It was humiliating apologizing to the tables when I felt like it wasn't my fault. Very sorry. We apologize. We are sorry you don't have any entrees right now. Wow. Yes, we're a team, but you can only do so much when you have a broken leg. Ladies, I promise it will not happen again, okay? Ladies... All: Yes, Chef. That was the first useful thing you have done tonight. It's also the last. Get out of here! All of you! [Bleep]. And hang your heads in shame because you absolutely suck. Piss off! Embarrassing! And on family night! You certainly don't way too salty. way too salty. All right, it's too salty. i'm sorry. Pfft, could you make it any hotter in here, by the way? - it feels good. - it feels good? - Yeah, it feels good. 75° is perfect. I can't even sleep in this room at night, it's so hot. honest to god. - what temperature would you prefer? - 68°. - 68°? ! See, that's some white-people shit right there, l.d. Black people like it a little bit warmer at night, okay? - at least compromise. - no no no, 75° works for me, l.d. I'll call leon. let's see what he says. leon! - leon, come in here! - he gonna let you know that that's how we like it. Okay, you know, i can't sleep. it's too hot at night. I want to sleep in 68° temperature. She wants to sleep in 75°. let's compromise at 72°. Oh no, fuck that, larry. you my motherfucking man, larry, but 72°? shit. You might as well sleep outside. i'm an 82° man myself. - see there, i told you! - 82°, that's my shit. that's my fucking region. - you really wanted it 68°. - 6-fucking-8? he said 68°? - get the fuck outta here. - it's like a frigerator. - oh my goodness. - you take that shit? - you bring a honey to the hotel and shit get up in that motherfucker. it's all cold and shit-- got to heat her ass up. All right now, you make sure you do your homework before you watch that tv. - hey, hi! - hey, larry. - hey, i got some shows tivo'd. don't erase them. They erase all my tivo'd shows. You know what, larry? there's been another robbery in this neighborhood. I was just talking to the neighbors. it's the third one this month. What are you talking to the neighbors for? They came over and let me know what's going on. You don't need to talk to the neighbors, okay? Yeah, but, larry, there's been a robbery. I'd rather have the thieves than the neighbors-- thieves don't impose. what are you talking about? the neighbors want your time. The thieves want your things. i'd rather give them things than time. Listen, have you heard anything from the doctor about loretta's biopsy? No no, they said a couple of days. Oh. you know, at first i was really worried, larry. But no matter what the outcome is, loretta has you by her side. You know, things could get bad, larry, but she's got you to hold her hand. And if she has to do chemo and it causes her to lose her hair, Throw up and all that, you gonna be right there by her side. Thank you, larry. 75°? i'm baking in that room at night. It's like i'm cinderella in there, i swear to you. cinderella? what do you mean? cinderella, you never saw the fairy tale cinderella? No no, i know cinderella. but what aspect of cinderella? what do you mean? - what aspect do you think i mean? - i don't know. the shoe? - she gets bossed around by the stepmother! - i'm comparing me-- - don't get mad at me! - don't get mad at me. - well, you're so stupid! - don't get mad at me. So that's what it's like, huh? that's terrible. That's what it's like. exactly. - that's what it's like. - oh, that's horrible. - you know what? you know what the worst part is? - what? we're waiting for the results. I got about 24 hours to get out of this thing before the results come back. Yeah, you can't break up with somebody who's got cancer. you gotta break up with her before she gets those test results. god, it's gonna be so hard. - why? what's the big deal? - what do you mean "what's the big deal?" The whole family's gotta move out-- it's a big deal! I'd much rather be in her position than mine any day of the week. No, to be the breaker-upper you're in control. Couples should have like a pre-breakup agreement Before they start going out because every relationship is going to end at some point. All you do is send a text. you make an agreement-- "if you see the word 'apricot,' it means it's over." Okay, hypothetically, what if you or she are eating apricots at that point? Can I tell you something about apricots? You know, one in 30 is a good one. It's such a low-percentage fruit. Always a mealy dry... Hey, how's it going? - Hi, Lar. - Oh, hey. Want to come to a dinner party tonight? - Tonight? - Yeah. You know you love my cooking. It's a little late for an invitation, is it not? - Well... it's an invitation nonetheless. - Who else is gonna be there? - Uh, eh, you don't need to know. - Why not? - Because it's not done, that's why not. - What do you mean it's not done? It's a social convention that people don't ask who's going to be there at the dinner party. It's just not done. - Big deal. Why isn't it done? - Because it isn't! I don't know the derivation of the convention. Why are you following it blindly like this? You should be glad that it happens that way, because if I told people you were coming, they might not show up. That's probably why people don't tell... Because if it gets out who's coming nobody would want to go. So why even have it in the first place if people don't want to be with each other? I don't think that's why. It's just not done. What's the downside of telling me? I don't know that there is a downside, except that... - You don't need to know. - Who's coming? - Don't you dare tell him. - What's that? - Who's coming? - I don't know. Why do you even get started with her on this stuff? That's my question. - What time? - 7:30. You've got something to do. You'd better go do it. Not now, maybe tonight. - Thank you. See you later. - Can't wait to see ya! - You take care of yourself, all right? - Thank you, doctor. You're welcome. We still don't know anything. Oh shoot! I forgot... I gotta feed those fish again. It's like a huge responsibility... Feeding fish. It's not fun. Think about it, you know? I'm outside, i gotta go home and feed fish? I mean, seriously, who gives a shit? Mr. david, i wanted to talk to you about your girlfriend. You know, they're not pets, really. But yet it's the same responsibility as a pet. But you get nothing back. you watch them. Is that supposed to be fascinating? I don't know. - can i talk to you about loretta? - what do you think? do you think she has-- Think she has cancer? I-- i can't speculate about that right now. We did a biopsy at the hospital and-- Let me ask you a question: Say you had to make a bet with vegas on this, Would you bet for cancer or against cancer? I-- i-- i don't get into that numbers game. - You must have an idea. - I don't. - No idea? - No idea. What is this thing? I've had this a while. What is that? It's just a skin tag. Just put a little lotion on there. But... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna write you a few prescriptions to fill out. I'm gonna prescribe zithromax and tylenol with codeine. Now the tylenol, that's just as needed for pain. Again, in a few days... any day, we'll have the biopsy back and that will help us determine what the next step is. But right now, I want you to just stay calm, and... What's wrong? You just go into the refrigerator without asking? I just got myself a lemonade. Is that a... I was just surprised you didn't ask. I'm surprised you didn't offer, to be honest. - Well, I was about to offer. - I don't think you we about to offer... Well, I was gonna offer... It is a little unusual to go into someone's refrigerator without asking, is it not? I can tell when somebody's gonna offer me lemonade. You were not going to offer me lemonade. If anything, you were going to complain to me about being a fish owner or something. It is difficult to be a fish owner. Why is that a priority? ! Your girlfriend is sick. I didn't say it's a priority. I just said that they need to be fed and it's something that I need to think about. You do not need to think about that. What you need to think about is the sick woman upstairs. I'm thinking about that. And by the way, why couldn't you ask? Are you so dainty you can't say "May I please have a glass of water?" "May I have a piece of pie?" It could be tuna fish... It doesn't matter. - No, it does matter. - Here, you want? Take... Take this. You don't offer... a hot day... a mover comes here... .. you say, "you want some tuna fish?" - You want this little pear? - Don't condescend to me with your tiny pear. I'm not the one that has a problem here. You are, my friend. - You are. - Yeah. - okay, fine. - yeah, fine. - hey, dr. schaffer. - hello. - Did you see that? Did you see that guy? - What was that whole thing? He goes in my refrigerator. Come on, you don't do that. - what did he take? - lemonade. liquids are okay. I don't believe that people should go into my refrigerator. - what kind of a stupid rule this that? - what do you mean? I don't go into other people's refrigerators. - You could go into my refrigerator. - I don't go into your refrigerator. you're a welcome guest. Hey, how's your sister, by the way? - bam bam? - yeah. Thanks for asking. she's doing a lot better. Yeah. i'm really glad we took her out of that mental institution - that's good. - yeah, i'm excited. You know, if there's anything i can do-- You let me know. You know what? there is something you can do. - what? - yeah you can come over today at 1:00 and visit with her. - visit her? what, are you kidding? - yeah. - why, you didn't mean it? - of course not! - Why did you say it then? - You know, it was some-- an empty gesture. it was something to say. guess what: You said it. be there at 1:00. But one thing-- when you go in the house, Look at her shoes before she calls your name. Don't look at her in the eyes. She'd love to see you. Oh, christ. I don't know how you take a statement like that seriously. But you said it and you're gonna stick to it. - and make her feel good! - all right. I'll see you at jeff's tonight. What's at jeff's? Oh, he's, um, having a little.. Dinner party. I guess i wasn't invited. I can't believe that. Why don't you make sure before you ask somebody... "Am i gonna see you tonight?" - that they were invited? - i just assumed you were going. don't assume anything. if they had told me Who was coming to the party, i would have known - and i wouldn't have asked, but they refused to tell me. - it's not your job To find out who's going to a party. All i want you to do is entertain my sister for two hours And then you can goto your godd. - she better not be dangerous. - be there at 1:00, okay? I gotta sit in a room with that nut? - you look good. - you do. Thank you. Thank you, jeff. And i appreciate the effort, larry. - no effort. - no, it was effortless. Okay, then we're all happy. So what's new? So what's happening? Guess who told marty to shut up. why, what did he say? - i give up. - who? - He didn't tell you? - No, no. She's great-- a great actress. - angelina jolie? - no! You know who i mean. she's an actress. She said shut up right to marty. - nicole kidman? - no! - julia roberts? - no! She's a multi-- multi-talented. Oh, i know, i know! hannah montana. no, you're not even trying! - the kardashians! - what? no! you know who it is! - do you have any idea? - no. Yeah, you do. - Got anything to eat? - No. - anything to drink? - nope. - nothing to eat or drink? - nope. i'm sorry, nothing. - boy, that's interesting. - I know. really. - isn't it? - It is. - i'm gonna go to the bathroom. - I was gonna go to the bathroom. - I just said i'm going to the bathroom. - but i'm saying, could i go first? - no no, i'm going first. - so when you come back, i'm gonna go. - Yes. - Okay. You had sex with a mental patient! - she's not a mental patient. - she's a mental patient. - she's living at funkhouser's. - she's a mental patient. If i went over to the institution and fucked her, then she's a mental patient. What happened? i got up to go to the bathroom. I was sitting there and she said, "i'm bored." I said, "if there's anything i can do"- you said that? - that's it. - an empty gesture? - an empty gesture. - that's how this whole thing started. - that's how it started and then i'm off banging her. You can't make an empty gesture to a funkhouser. They take you up on it. How come you don't have a doorbell? You know what you did? - you totally fucked me. - what? - you fucked me. - what are you talking about? what'd you tell funkhouser about the party for? - Pfft, oh, why? he said something? - Yeah, he said something. he called to complain he wasn't invited and susie invited him. oh, that is so lame! you know that? that is so lame to call up and do that. and guess what else they did? They brought bam bam. bam bam's here! he brought that fucking nutbag into my house! oh my god. what the fuck did you go and tell him for? If you had told me who was coming to the party in the first place, I never would have said anything to him because i would have known he wasn't coming. It's crazy-- all these party rules: you can't tell who you're inviting, You can't tell anybody you're going And you can't talk about it after. It's like living in east germany or something. Now i'm screwed. just look at this. this is crazy. - what is that? is that dr. schaffer? what's he doing here? He had a party recently. he invited us. we're returning the favor. what's the big deal? - Again. - again what? if i had known that he was gonna be here, i wouldn't have come. if i had known bam bam was gonna be here, I would have left town! - who's that guy with the doctor? - that's his boyfriend. - what, seriously? - yeah, he's gay. - oh my god, i didn't know that. - yeah, listen, i gotta go help susie. - hey, how you doing? hi, mr. david, how are you? - this is sam. - hi. it's good to meet you. i didn't know you were gay. Uh, yeah. - is that a surprise to you? - Yeah, i'm a little surprised, yeah. Why? i don't know. i just didn't think you were gay. - what is that supposed to mean? - It doesn't mean anything. it means i was surprised to discover that he's gay. but why? how would i seem if i was gay? what is seeming gay? you seem slightly gay and you don't. so i wouldn't be surprised if somebody told me-- but i'm surprised that somebody tells me you're gay. - is that a crime? - no, it's not a crime. it's just odd. it's not a crime. and it's a little bit offensive. i'm sorry if you're offended. i don't accept your apology 'cause i don't believe that you are sorry. How about if i said i'm pleasantly surprised? - You're living in another decade, mr. david. - i don't think i am. - well, i think you are. - all right, fine. fine, we disagree. - okay, we'll agree to disagree. - All right, great. Unbelievable. What did you do with bam bam? - What? nothing. what do you mean? - When you came over to the house. - i didn't do anything. - It's like a miracle. I've never seen her spirits like this. I mean, the medicine and your visit-- she's a different person. That is fantastic! What great news. I... You shouldn't be giving me any of the credit. This is the man... Come here, come here. - What? - He says Bam Bam is... - ...is like a new person. - How about that? That's great. - Were you there too? - Yeah. No wonder she was singing "I love the fat boy." - I couldn't figure it out. - I love the fat boy. It's great. I can't thank you guys enough! - What did you do? - We just sat and talked with her. - Did you play any games? - No games, uh-huh. - Did you play a million pick-up sticks? - No. The key to the whole thing? You treat them normal and they really respond. I love both of you and you gotta promise me you'll do it again. - If we have time. - It's possible. Oh no, you gotta promise. - We'll see. - Just say you'll go over there. Dinner is served! - Let's go have some dinner. - Thank you so much! Susie, these ingredients are very fresh and well prepared. Oh, thank you, Bam Bam. That's so sweet of you. I'm so glad you were able to join us. I'm so glad you still have food in your fridge considering Larry's around. What is that? What do you mean? Larry likes to clean out fridges like he did today at Marty's house. You were into our fridge uninvited, right? That's ridiculous. Oh? Then might you explain the whereabouts of the freshly-sliced deli-packaged turkey... I don't even eat turkey. ...the yellow mustard in a glass jar. And the lemonade soda? Oh, lemonade? So you're a hypocrite too? Because I had lemonade at your house and you threw... a shit fit. She's emotionally unstable. Are you gonna believe a word this woman says? You know, I don't mind if you take liquid, but when you take regular food, - I have a problem. - I didn't take anything! That's crazy. Speak the truth. Help him with the truth, would you, Jeff? I wouldn't know. I actually wasn't there in the kitchen. You were... You were... Oh no, you weren't. I know where you were! - You were in bed with me. - What? What did you say? What the fuck is she talking about Jeff? What the hell did you do? - Oh, I did nothing. - He didn't do anything. Did you take advantage of this poor deranged girl? You are sick! That's disgusting. What did you do now? You sick fucking pervert. You're... You're serving nothing but lies here. I'm not hungry. What did you do to her, Jeffrey? - How could you do that? - She's fucking nuts! She's a nutbag! - She's a nutbag. I did not do anything. - He's gonna sleep with a mental patient? All right, all right, all right! I believe you! Even Bam Bam is not crazy enough to sleep with you, okay? Only I am. There you go. That's exactly... That's exactly right. Of course. Okay, everybody, everybody, I want to apologize for the Funkhouser family. Oh, stop. It's not necessary. I'm going to have to take her back to the institution. I'm gonna tell you something: I think it would be good for her. And you're doing it for her own safety, for her own good. - No, I'm not so certain. - No, it's good. It's a great thing, because you've gotta think of the long haul. Let's enjoy our dinner. I'm sorry this happened. - The best salad anybody ever made. - Thank you, sweetheart. Hello? What? Hold on, hey, what? Oh, okay. All right, I'll go pick it up. No, I'll leave right now. - You're leaving? - I'm so sorry. I have to go. I have to pick up Loretta's medication. - You didn't give it to her yet? - No, I've gotta get it from the pharmacy. You're leaving, I haven't served the entree yet. It's sad because I'm having so much fun here, and then... and I gotta go and... - Maybe I'll come back. - No, don't bother coming back. Go go go! I got the prescription, Auntie Rae. I'm just gonna get some food to go. - Could you do me a favor? - What? Could you go... up to Loretta and ask her what the name of that restaurant was - we ate in in Santa Monica a few weeks ago? - No. - Why not? - Because she's resting. - Is she sleeping? - No. - Can she talk? - Yes. So let her talk. No. I don't want her talking. I want her resting. Resting? What does resting even mean? She's not sleeping, is she? You can talk and rest. Larry, I am not gonna bother Loretta with this bullshit. Do you hear me? She resting. Bye. Oh, hi, Mr. David. Nice to see you. I'd like some food to go. Oh, I just sat your party. - Party? - Yeah, you had a reservation. I have a reservation? Let me see. "Larry David, 2." My God. Thank you. Well well. Hi, hello. Larry. My man. How's it going, brother? - Pretty good. - Give me some. All right. What, are you using my name to get a table in here? Well, it's so crowded. I just thought you'd... - ...have a better chance. - really? You want to join us? - You could eat with us. - Are you sure? Really? - Please. Sit down. - I miss you. You sure? - Great. - Oh, by the way, I put you up for an N.A.A.C.P. image award. Yeah? Fingers crossed, baby. I think you'll win. - Oh, thank you. - How is Loretta? Oh, she's... she's... yeah. Yeah? Yeah, she's good. How's the no-fly underwear guy? Um, it's not happening. It didn't work out. - Really? - Yeah. Maybe Larry's people can hook you up with somebody. You know Lil Wayne? You know Lil Wayne. Oh, like this. Yeah. I can't... I can't read my... menu. - It's so dark in here. - It's so dark. I honestly have... This is insane. How do they expect people to read this menu? I've got a candle here and I can't read it. I'm gonna go outside. Oh yeah, I'm gonna go outside. I'll go out with you. Larry, what you putting on your hair? I like that. Posner. You learning, Larry. Hang in there, baby. Oh, look, the Caesar salad. - Caesar salad. - You used to get that. That's very good here. - Right. With the 200 croutons. - A lot of croutons. - There were a lot of croutons. - Ton of croutons. I can't believe I'm sitting here with you. - It's weird. - It's crazy. Isn't it? I really miss you. I miss you too. - You do? - Well... kind of. I mean, I do, I do. It's just what was happening was not working for me. It just wasn't... I don't know. It got to this place where you were always at the house and you didn't have anything to do and you... it was just different. Like when you were working on "Seinfeld," You had a job and you'd get up and you'd go, like, do something with other people. And then you'd come home And it was like that was the right amount of Larry. I understand. Too much Larry, I get that. We can reduce Larry in half. We can reduce Larry to a third. We can reduce Larry to three hours a day. That's... - Slivers of Larry is better. - I get that. I've got 24-hour Larry, you think I like it? - Hello? - Larry, Dr. Schaffer just called. He's on his way over to the house right now. He's got the results of the biopsy. He's coming over to the house right now? I'm on my way! - Is everything okay? - Uh, yeah. I gotta go. - Is it an emergency? - Yeah, I gotta go. I'll talk to you. I gotta go get out of something. Shit, damn it! Come on, schmohawk. Larry! - Oh my God. - What took you so long? Never mind. Apology accepted. Now call Marty. - Bam bam... - Call Marty. - I'll go in the house... Just tell me, you lied, right? You lied, Jeff enjoyed. Dirty God... Don't look at them, Larry. Don't get eye contact. Go! Go! Go! - Nice! - Oh my God. - Oh my God. - Only call Marty. - What? Yeah, I am. - Call Marty. - I gotta get in there, bam bam. - No... Ow! Call him. Get your cell out. Bammer, what are you doing here? Tell him Jeff said I was in the top 10! - Tell him. - Stop it. Calm down. Tell Marty Jeff enjoyed me. You should not have left the house. Folks, we had a report of a break-in. Did you see anything? Okay, she'll give you a statement. I've gotta get in the house. I'll take your statement now. No, she can't give you a statement. She's not qualified to make a statement. - She's crazy. - What? ! No, she's not crazy. Yeah, after what she said at dinner tonight, she's crazy. - Oh no no, she... - I'm taking her back to the home. I'm taking her back. If she can't give one, I'll need a statement from you. Have a good night. Sir, did you see a vehicle? Was it individuals What happened? What exactly did you see? Sir, your attention here, sir, if you would, please. All right, well, I saw a guy jump over a hedge across the street. He had a... Oh, the doctor's coming. Larry. Folks, I wish that I had better news for you. The biopsy came back positive for cancer. Now... - Oh, Larry, Larry! - Are you with me? Come on, Larry, come on. Okay, all right. I know this can be very upsetting. - Dr. Schaffer, can I go in and see her? - Yes. It's gonna be okay. Now... This is really where the hard work starts. She's gonna need a lot of help. There's a lot of vitamins, a lot of medicines that she's gonna need. Organic juices three times a day. I would keep the house warmer. Keep it at about 78° to 82° minimum. The warmer the better, really. That helps with the healing process.

No times a week. You won't have time for that. - What? Nine holes. - Zero holes, Mr. David! This is serious. Now I won't lie... things are going to get ugly. There's going to be vomiting.

We've been looking for you. -Why? . - Kim Reeshaug. - How did you meet? . - At a cafe. Whatthe hell are you up to? . - We want to ask you a few questions. - About Ml6? . Or if I'm a terrorist? . - lmbecils! - You found her in the tunnel. - Yes. - Did you see anyone else there? . No. - Am I a suspect? . - No. They just want to know what Kim was involved in, and why she was killed. They don't give a shit abouther. They just want to kiss Ml6's ass! I think I saw Tom in a blue ChryslerVoyager. I checked the license plate. Phony. I think I saw him in the back. Tom? . You think he was kidnapped? . We got the pictures from Ml6. George Robinson, American citizen, 51. One of the top people. They think he's in Sweden. They don't know were the rest is. - But ifRobinson... - Distribute these nationwide.

Everything okay? . - No. - A double then. - Yes. - Who was found in the tunnel? . - One of my pursuers. - Who? . Why... - I tried to call you. I changed my number. This is a bad place. Come. Swedish Security Service had you undersurveillance. Me too, maybe. - Why? . - They saw us togetheratthe cafe. -What happened in the tunnel? . - Tom and I had no place to run. Then they came and grabbed Tom, and I struggled to free him. - Then we were separated. - One of them died. I know. Melina. She must have knocked her head, while we were fighting. - Then they burnt her and... - Who? . I can't tell you. They took Tom to get at me. What will happen to him? . -What the hell are you involved in? . - Please, I need help. Help me find Tom, and then I'll tell you everything. -Where are they keeping him? . - I may be able to fiind out. Help me? . Not if you won't tell me anything. Gunvald! Tom is your son. A SNlFTER? . GOOD,HUH? .! You swallowed that hook, line and sinker, huh? . - Yes. - I just got a shot. Against what? . Damned if I know. But pensioners got it for free. They shoved it up my ass and out through my armpit. Now I'm immortal. Just like Osten Wamer bring with the Tyrolese hat. - But he's dead. - I know. Maybe that's why the shot was free. How does it feel to look down on me? . Feels pretty good. You know, "Upstairs, Downstairs". Are you happy down there? . Why not? . I'm used to your balcony and you. Mano a mano. Two lonely men, free to discuss anything they want to be it wallpaper paste or silverfish. Not many people are that blessed. - I'm coming up. - No. - Why not? . - I'm going to bed. - We'll have a bedside snifter. - I have to rest.

To change society, change our life style stop the exploitation of Earth's resources, make a better world. - What have they done? . - Tried to sink a whaler near Iceland. Sabotaged a chemical weapons plant in Spain. Blown up a pesticide plane in the States and attacked a gene bank in Kuala Lumpur. One of them died. According to Ml6 they've evolved into environmental terrorists. Mom! Darling! Happy birthday. I'm so sorry about all this. - Are they nice to you? . - They gave me a game. - Cool. - No, I want to be with you. As soon as I've done this, we're going to London. - Promise? . - Of course. Darling. - Have you got your cell? . - Yes, I hid it in my boxers. I turned it off, so they wouldn't take it. Good. Keep it turned off, unless you're absolutely sure you're alone. - Got any games? . - No. It's Kim. Tom is on 26 Dobelnsgatan for the next hour. Maybe... - Are you alone? . - No. Kim is alive. You asked me if I had any special relationship to her. I did... do. We met ten years ago. She took part in a sit-down and I was there to keep the peace at a distance. In Humlegarden Park. I fell head overheels. She was beautiful. Remember when I took two months off in the middle of an investigation? . - A relative of yours had cancer... - I lied. We eloped to Zanzibar and lived like children of nature in a beach hut. - So Kim Reeshaug is alive? . - Yes, she's alive. We drifted apart, and I hadn't seen her till I came across her at the cafe. - Who was the corpse in the tunnel? . - I don't know. -What's going on? . - She's involved in some Ml6 case. They've got her son. - Who? . - I don't know. They've kidnapped him. She wants me to help fiind the boy. - Do you know where he is? . - Yes, but they're moving him... - In 20 minutes. - So you're going there to... - Yes. - Alone? . - That sounds like a god-awful idea. - Yes. I'll be in touch. Get out ofthe car! . Hi. Shot? . Any lD? . No, but he had this in his pocket. Some kind of map. - Hi. - Are you alone? . - Shit, are you hurt? . - Marginally. - You need stitches. - Yeah... What... - What happened? . - Can I crash here for a night or two? . Sure, but I haven't got... Without your knowledge. - What do I tell... - Nothing. Security Service is staking out my place. Sure, you can sleep on the couch, if you want to. Thanks. Have you got... a pair of pants and socks? . Yes. -What's up with Security Service? . - They think I know something. - Something they don't know. - And you don't? . - Yes. - Anything to do with Kim Reeshaug? . - Yes. They think she's dead. - And she isn't? . No. - Bergman. - Where are you? . - At home. Where are you? . - Gunvald got shot and fell in the sea. - The divers are on it. Get overhere. - I'm on my way. Hurry. - What did he say? . - He thinks you were shot and fell in. - He's right. - He thinks you're still down there. He called in the divers. You have to tell him you're alive. Beck. Go deeper. Where the hell are you? . Why? . What the hell are you... Sources say the shooting was gang-related. Following a car chase through central Stockholm an unknown number of people opened fire in the harbor. One person allegedly died, but the police have not verified this. Divers have... He could've drowned. You did the... Right thing in calling in half the diving team, while the idiot is in a hotel? . - Here. It's a map. - What am I... I don't know! Give it to forensics, or call in a map expert. Where are you now? . The hotel bar? . I see. - Everheard of Philippe Amaux? . - No. Frenchman, 29, a member of EJM. He was shot in the harbor earlier. Gunvald Larsson's car and gun were found at the scene, but he's missing. Gunvald was reluctant to talk to us the other day, and we respected this. We assumed he wasn't involved. This shows the contrary. Do you know something we don't? . - About? . - The murder of Kim Reeshaug. Gunvald's relationship to her. Her son's disappearance. The harbors hooting. - No. - Okay. An hour ago we put out an APB on Gunvald for the murder of Amaux. If he contacts you, I expect you to arrest him. Okay. Hi... Come in. I... You're wanted by Security Service, and I've been ordered to arrest you. - Then do it. - I'd love to. You're an asshole! You take off on some private vendetta and shoot a foreign citizen... You know why I did it, so shut up! - Did you tell the bozos about Kim? . - No. I kept that dark. I tried. It went wrong. Forall I know they could've killed Kim and Tom by now. - Can'tyou get in touch with her? . - No. - You kept it dark? . - Yes. - Thanks. - But you have to talk to them. Now. Give me two hours. - I thought you were dead. - Switched roles. Who's he? . - He's... I can't. - Kim, listen to me now. I'm going out on a limb fo ryou here, but you won't tell me a damn thing. I tried to get Tom. I failed. During the process I got shot, and I shot another man dead. This isn't Zanzibar. Get real. - Where is Tom? . - I don't know. You don't know? . How many of you are there? . - We were nine, but now only seven. - What are you going to do? . - I wanted out, but they took Tom. - Why did you want out? . They took in the wrong people. Everything's gone to hell. What are you planning to do? . We're going to... - Who called? . - I don't know. We were cut off. Melina Stavramos, EJM as well. She was murdered in the tunnel. - How do you know? . - They checked her DNA in London. - You knew Kim was alive, didn't you? . - I found out yesterday. And kept it from me out of loyalty to Gunvald? . - Yes. - Don't you grasp the gravity of this? . Yes, but I thought... You went behind my back! And Security Service and Ml6's! Whatthe hell got into you? . We don't know where Kim is. We don't know where Tom is. - We don't know what they're up to. - Nor what that idiot Gunvald is up to! - What? . - Someone called, but we were cut off. Look. Shit! Back up. Back up! Get out. Out! The number's listed to a company on 5 Dobelnsgatan. "Design and Light." It's the Technicrone team. Let them through. Martin! Gunvald! - So there's seven of them? . - Yes. - Did they know you were a cop? . - No. - They must've recognized you. - They recognized me. - But they didn't get... - They didn't get shit out of me. - What are they planning? . - I just know they left with some bags. Hi. I need to renew my parking license. They had a hard time pinpointing it butthey say it's this area here. Martin! - The map's of a transformer station. - What map? . - The one found on the victim. - Philippe Amaux? . And? . The station supplies power to the Forsmark Nuclear Power Station. - In case it can't produce its own. - Forsmark? . - Yes. - Kim? . - No, Tom. - Hi, Tom. This is Gunvald from the cafe. - Is Mom there? . - No, they took her. - Where are you? . - Locked in a car. I can't open the doors, and Mom left with some guy. Where is the car? . In a forest near a large power cable. Is there anything in the car? . Maybe a map? . Yes, some papers and a map. Look at them. - What did the map show? . - A transformer station near Forsmark. - I'm on my way there. - No, Gunvald! Damn! - The chopper's ready in 20 minutes. - Forsmark guard room doesn't answer. It's number one. Goran, check generator one. We've got a red flag here. - Pressure on number two? . - Zero. What the hell...? . Their timing is perfect. The place is vulnerable at the moment. - Why? . - It's the annual overhaul. They replace several uranium rods and have to shut down the reactor. It has to be cooled to avoid a meltdown. They get power from an extemal station. That's why they're vulnerable. But if the station is cut off, their own generators kick in. - What if they don't work? . - There's four of them. No risk. There goes number three. I'm going to call for help. Go away from the window. Get out, hurry! - What's wrong? . - The line's dead. On the floor. On the floor! . We've just received something you need to see. We'd have surface contamination and deaths near the scene and in all surrounding areas. Get in. Wait for me. Don'tlet anyone see you. Lock the doors. Is this some kind of joke? . -When did you get it? . - Just now. So the govemment confirms that Forsmark has been attacked? . - Yes. - What about the film? . - Don't show it. - Why not? . It's a matter of national security. - You're going to chance it then? . - How do you mean? . And hope they don't blow it up. - Are Forsmark's guards unarmed? . - Yes. The same goes for all Swedish nuclear power stations. It's a political decision. Police! On the ground! Where's Mom? . -What's going to happen to Tom? . - We're going to take him in. He's got a couple of cousins ofthe same age, so it will be fline. We've looked after Tom before when ever Kim went away on her long trips. - His father... - Kim never told us who he was. - She never mentioned him? . - No. Maybe she didn't want anything to do with him. Maybe. I don't think so though. I think his father was the love of her life. But something went wrong. Maybe they were too different. She was the way she was. She didn't want to settle down. - Maybe. - No. You look very smart. - Take care. - The lot? . The lot. - Will you come visit now and then? . - Of course I will. I'm your... buddy. How did it go? . There's something I haven't told you. - Your son? . - Yes. - Does Tom know? . - No. - You don't want to... - No, not just yet. I didn't want to present him with a dad in the middle of the funeral. He's in good hands with Tom and her family. For now. Until the grieving is over. Both for him and for me. Subtitles·. Helle Schou Kristiansen It's a day of high emotion as we open our doors To a nation from beyond our imagination. The captains of our 29 ships are present. The visitors didn't just get here. They've been here for years. There's others out there like me. we'll help. there were hundreds of images being captured by the damn jackets. why don't they just annihilate us and get it over with? They need us for something. we want to provide Complete medical services to all. john may started the fifth column- The first group of visitors to ever turn against the leadership. the fifth column says hello. georgie, thiss erica. I brought a friend. hello. hello. tyler's the one. you should use him. You're doing an excellent job. thank you, mother. georgie. I feel like I've been doing a lot of talking. Sorry about that. No, it's-it's okay. we're-we're grateful. You know so much more about the V's than we do. Been doing this a long time. They came after me when I first found out about them. I got away. my family didn't. Jack told me. I'm sorry. How do you know so much about them? Been doing this even longer than georgie. Look, we all know why we're here. We need to hit them back for what they did to us at the warehouse. We don't have enough people to hit anyone back. We don't need a lot of people. We just need to get our hands on a V. Then what? Then we cut it open and we show the world what's underneath. If we do that, they got no choice but to retaliate. That's just a war we can't win. they'd wipe us out. Georgie, no one's backing down, But we have to be smart about how we fight. You didn't answer my question before How do you know so much about the V's? You got nothing to worry about with ryan. He saved my ass at the warehouse. If it wasn't for him, I'd be dead right now. why? Why didn't you just tell them that you're a V? It's a priest and an FBI agent. What, you can't trust them? what is wrong with you? I better not ever hear you talk about skinning a V again. His name was dale maddox, a sleeper agent we had installed in the new york fbi office. And you're telling me he was murdered aboard my ship? Yes. in the medical bay. We've never had a murder any of our ships. Who would do such a thing? There are rumors of traitors aboard-fifth column. We can't afford any kind of dissonance among our people. Joshua, assemble a team immediately and find out who did this. Hi, sweetheart. You working? Can I talk to you for a minute? Absolutely. can you give me two minutes? ...than the visitors' high commander, anna. I understand you have some exciting news to share with us today. we do, chad. we're announcing a new program that will spread the miracles of our healing centers to countless people. do you know when she'll be back? Well, is there another doctor I can see? no, it's all right. Yeah, thanks anyway. You all right? I feel like crap. You know, there's that nasty bug that's going around. No, it's these meds. they're making me so tired. I'm trying to get 'em changed, but dr. soder's out of town till next week. Maybe I should just stop taking them. No, you can't just stop taking heart medication. I know. I'll be fine. I've just got a couple of clients today, so I'm gonna take it easy. Okay. You need anything, you let me know, okay? I will. Love you. I love you. which brings me to today's announcement. our physicians are able to treat a number of human ailments, but preventative medicine is also important. we've developed an injection- call it a vitamin supplement- designed to strengthen the immune system. not just strengthen it, I'm told, but supercharge it to help fight off numerous forms of cancer, other diseases, even stave off the effects of aging. all true. we'll be offering the injections around the clock at our healing centers in the days to come. any chance you're gonna cure the common cold for us? your flu shots will have to suffice. I'm afraid even we haven't cracked the common cold. I guess even the V's have their limitations. anna, thank you so much for being with us. mom... It's been, like, way more than two minutes. Yeah. um... yes. Sorry. Hi. hey. I'm all yours. Okay... okay. It's-it's about the girl you met last night-Lisa. Half-naked girl in my son's room lisa. mom. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. do you-okay. o- okay. I'm not gonna get it. I wanna hear. I'm not gonna get it. it's work. I mean, you should take it. it's fine. Will you hold on for a second? 'cause I will get rid of 'em. Okay? evans. yeah, it's ryan. Yeah, I'm gonna need to call you back. what? no, this can't wait. No, ty. bubba. what- no, mom, seriously, it-it's fine. No, I'm-I can-I w- well, we'll talk about it later. We can... Yeah. We need to meet... right now. This thing that anna's calling a vitamin injection- She's lying. How do you know? a couple years ago, I took out a cell of V scientists. They were working on an injection. They tried to mass produce and distribute it among humans. If you're gonna put something harmful into a vitamin, Then why do you go on television, make such a big deal about it? anna wouldn't make an announcement like this if it wasn't something big. I know what I'm talking about. They've reactivated this plan. so they're gonna what-They're gonna take us out one shot at a time? No, this is part of something that's-that's just much bigger. Now I know the names of the V's that were involved the last time. some of them survived. Maybe you can run 'em through the fbi, See who's still out there. Mm. this isn't getting us anywhere. Is that all of them? Yeah. No. Try peter combs. He was a lab assistant, pretty low level. That's him. Professor of chemistry? not low level anymore. This peter combs-he's a V? he's a V yeah, I say we track him down and find out what he's up to. How about we just take him out? taking out one V is not gonna get us anywhere. If we follow him, he'll lead us to a bigger part of the puzzle. Seriously, that's the plan? Follow him? That's the plan. I can't talk to my mom anymore. I've tried telling her about this girl I met... She won't give me two seconds. she doesn't trust me. She just keeps on telling me, "stay away from the V's. " and you don't know how to tell her that the V's are important to you? She doesn't want to hear it. Look... I joined the peace ambassadors. If my mom knew, she would go ballistic. she thinks the V's are evil. and how do you see them? The world's broken. They're fixing it. All we do is, we get in their way. They got these healing centers. The things they can do... Have you been down there to the healing centers? No. not yet. Why? I just... I've been tempted myself to check them out. I hear you have to wait months though. Well, I mean, if you really wanna go, I - I might be able to help. I - I kinda know someone. That's really sweet of you, tyler. I might actually take you up on that. I hear they're curing blindness, Helping handicapped people walk, all these great things, and... My mom will never know because she won't even talk to one. you know, I shouldn't even care. I'm gonna be 18 in a month, and then after that I won't have to deal with any of this. your mom doesn't stop being a mom because you're 18. - yeah. well, I feel like she stopped being by mom a long time ago. I thought it might take longer, But I think tyler's ready. Good. Bring him up to the ship. Tell him I wanna meet him. = It's Only The Beginning =- Thank you again for doing this report on our healing centers. It's not like I had much of a choice. Anna wouldn't do the interview with me unless I did this. That was amazing. And that's why we want you to share our story with the world. this is tyler. leave a message. still can't get ahold of him? He's mad at me. Ah. you wanna talk about it? I do not. Okay. hello? Hey, it's ryan. we're set. Class is out in 15 minutes. When combs heads to his car, we got him covered. I'm on the ground floor. georgie's upstairs. I'm checking in with georgie now. You've interviewed all of the medical staff? Extensively. we couldn't find anyone Who could shed any light on the murder. How many of your staff were on duty that day? 14, maybe 15. Gather them. They've already been questioned. I understand that. Gather them anyway. you have to get off the ship. I am not running. You're too important. the column needs you. you'll carry on, and so will the others. no, you cannot be sacrificed no matter what. I won't let it happen. Hey, combs. I'm gonna cut you open and show the world what you are. Get the car. georgie. You need to pressure on that wound. What the hell happened? He just started shooting at me. We need to get him some help. I'm gonna take care of combs. What happened? I don't know yet. You got him? I got him. I'll take care of georgie. just be safe. you, too. Did you think you were gonna get away? Huh? you thought you were gonna get away this time. You can't stop us, filthy traitor! No! no! You're a visitor. What the hell is going on? Erica, you and I want the same thing. We both want to know what combs was doing. Except now I got lost and lonely. Last night, you saw me? No. You can't be her. When you made me, didn't you feel inspiration? Almost like your hands were being moved by a force not of this world? You made this body so that I could come to life! Am I in the twilight zone or am I just nuts? I'm so glad I picked you! I'm gonna create someone who doesn't like me? So, tell me your life story. It seems to have slipped my mind. It's a long story. See, I was born in 2514 B.C. in Edfu, Egypt. -I'll be 4,501 next April. -I'll bake a cake. Back then, I wasn't allowed to do anything. Do you know I was supposed to marry? -Who? -A camel dung dealer. Would have been my guess. I'm stressed. I'm having a hallucination caused by stress. Does this feel like a hallucination? Come on, let's go have some fun. Food additives. It's food additives. Come on! Except for early morning clouds the weather for the Greater Philadelphia area should remain the same.... Damn him. ...with a slight increase in temperature. The things I could've done with these tools! -You like to work with your hands? -Yes. I love to build and invent things. -Back in Edfu, I even made a pair of wings. -And I'm sure you flew. That's right. Almost. You still don't believe I'm real, do you? I'm open for discussion. Why don't we stick to good, old-fashioned hand tools for now. -You've got good hands. -Thank you. I like the way they felt when you were putting me together. Tonight we'll do something different and special. Something this store has never seen before. I wish you didn't look so worried. Easy for you to say. As a mannequin, you'll always have work. Me, I'm gonna wind up in the nuthouse after this. I wonder if insanity is covered in the employee health plan? That's the dress I should wear in the window. Don't do that. You weren't so shy when you were creating me. You weren't so real. Good God, who are you? Good morning, boys and girls. I don't see Zingy. She just bit smiling Alan. You look foxy! Can I ride you? -I'll be walking to work. Thank you. -No! Don't be silly! Wait! I thought our plans were for 8:00 last night. My mistake. -I've got to talk to you. -We have nothing to talk about. Take a hike, wussy pants. Something happened last night. I'm going crazy. I saw things that couldn't have happened. Where were you? You look like you slept in the street. -Prince and Company. -Prince and Company! Your big job! You know the mannequin that I made? She's there. She came to life. She knew who I was. You could have told me you just decided to stand me up. Instead, you come here to me lying with this ridiculous story! No, I'm not lying, I'm insane. Armand, let's get out of here. Mom, when I was growing up, did I ever do anything really strange? Yeah, I know I was always different. Let me ask you this: Is there any history of insanity in the family? I mean, Grandma-- Grandma and Grandpa weren't half-brother and sister? No, I'm fine, Ma. You know, you're alone a lot. You start inventing things. Women, you know, a beautiful woman.... Enough about me. How are you? You ever have hallucinations? This is America. You do not set the pace by redecorating. -You demolish. -Of course. I'll remember that. We'll build the best Illustra yet on that site. And when I move up someone will have to take my place here. I'll be keeping my eye on you. B.J.! You won't believe it! Prince and Company has the most incredible window. I'm talking fabu. People were lined up outside to get a peek. At what? I passed it coming back from the tanning session. It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Really? You know, it really wasn't that great. It was interesting. In a jejune way, at best. I didn't care for it myself. You know.... You should have seen it! It was beyond brilliant! There was 20 mannequins with tennis rackets coming out of.... Beej, he's just a twerpy stock boy! That window was a fluke. When I move up, somebody will have to take my place here. But if you let that stock boy screw things up, it sure won't be you. I've worked on this deal too long to have it ruined by some snot-nosed punk. I can handle him. I meant you! Of course you did. But you know that the board meeting is today. I guarantee the sale will go through. Under your inspired leadership, Illustra will reach new heights. So we-- Richardsl Where in the hell did you learn to kiss ass like that? Did you take a class? No, sir. That's a God-given gift. Beej? B.J., are you there? We'd all love to know what possessed Switcher to create such a window display. Did you see those crowds gaping on the sidewalk? It's an embarrassment! Never you fear, your Hollywood is here. Rumor Control has it that the board wants to fire your little behind. You let me in there at those so-and-sos. I'll straighten them out, tout de suite. How can they think of firing you? They're business people. They won't appreciate an emotional appeal. You're right. I was hoping to avoid this, but this is an hour of desperation. This is not the way to approach this, okay? You don't think so? Please don't tell anyone you saw me dressed like this. I have a reputation to uphold. My lips are sealed. I appreciate this demonstration. That's it! A demonstration! I'll create a media event. Call the newspaper, boys and girls. The headline will read: "If Jonathan is fired, Hollywood flies." Excuse me while I step out onto the window ledge. No! Come on. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. -I do get carried away sometimes. -No, not you. That Richards, he gives men a bad name! No! Mr. Richards said he was gonna fix everything for me. What arrogance! That worm of a stock boy has created an affront to the dignity of this store. I'll have it taken down immediately and make sure that lunatic never works in this town again. What say, shall we move on to the sale to Illustra? Just a minute, Mr. Richards. I believe we're onto something here. Maybe people will come to see our bold, new window displays. If they come to look, they'll stay to buy. With all due respect, Mrs. Timkin, it's a little late for that. And we do have the firm offer from Illustra. For one tenth the value of the store! Besides, I can't bear the thought of selling this place especially to that awful B.J. Wert. We know how much the store means to you, ma'am but, 10 percent is better than bankruptcy. I think Mrs. Timkin is right. I move we postpone the sale for six weeks. I second the motion. All in favor? All opposed? This meeting is adjourned. -Harris, would you bring Mr. Switcher in? -What? No, wait. I think-- Good news. We've not only decided to keep you on but I'm promoting you to visual merchandiser. You're kidding! That's great! What is it? Just keep doing what you did last night and you'll be fine. I'm not sure I can do it again. Last night might have been a one-time inspiration. Don't doubt yourself. Go with it. Feel it. You're doing the job you were meant to do. You must lead a charmed life. It was all I could do to save your skin in here. No thanks are necessary. Good evening, Mr. Richards, sir. Listen, that new stock boy, Switcher, has been promoted. He'll be doing windows at night. Just keep an eye on him for me. Do you suspect pilferage, sir? I'd be happy to strip-search him. You people that work at night scare me. I just want you to let me know what he's up to, how he works. Yes, sir. His M.O. Would you like that in a written report? You write? No. Rambo does. -Just watch him. -Yes, sir. Come on, Rambo. We have got ourselves a mission. Jesus Christ, Rambo! Hi, it's me! Jonathan, remember? I guess it was just temporary insanity. "O ye of little faith." You're back! I thought-- You remind me of my old boyfriend, Chris. He didn't have any confidence, either. -Chris? Who's Chris? -Just a sailor. I told him that the world was round and I never saw him again. Christopher Columbus? You knew him? So, you didn't come here directly from Edfu? No. I tried out different times and places but none of them ever seemed right. You didn't happen to run into Michelangelo? Michelangelo. Yes! He wasn't very interested in me. He was involved with some guy named David. -Come on. -Were you there? Mrs. Timkin loved what you did last night, but they think I did it. They want me to keep doing brilliant windows. -You've gotta help me. -Of course. You are magic. Where do they hide all the musicians? -Come on, let's dance! -No. I can't. Shake that thing! Great. I want you to meet somebody. This is Emmy. Very nice. Maybe I can get G.I. Joe, and we can double sometime. No! You don't understand. She-- Don't say nothing. It's cool. It's obvious to this country girl that you're an A-number one creative freak. Imagine pretending to be a stock boy when you're a major artiste. I am so jealous. Some people may find you strange, but not me. I respect that. Create, honey, create! I'll leave you two alone and go meet Albert for dinner. -I hope he doesn't mind. -No. Just when I think you're real, you vanish. What's with you? -What's with me? -Didn't I tell you? You're the only one who can see me like this. -That's not exactly fair, is it? -Talk to them. Do you hear something? Wait a minute. Okay, you Rambo, get ready. Attack! Rambo. What? Stay there! Easy, Felix. I don't think she's armed. You can fool Rambo, but it won't work with me, Switcher! My brain is quicker than a-- I think that we've outdone ourselves. Yeah, this one's kind of fun. -Ready? -Let her rip. Very nice. -Good morning, Mrs. T. -Good morning, Jonathan. What do you think? It's hot, there's gonna be meltdown. Yes! Hot, smoking, burning, churning, whatever! Oh yes! Hello? Hi, Jonathan. Hi. It's me, Roxie. I thought you weren't talking to me. I wanted to see you. I want to know you're all right. I gotta get some sleep. I work nights now, okay? All right, but get up in time for lunch. I'm taking you to Chez Jacques at 1:00. You know where it is. Yeah, I was fired from that place once, I almost burned that joint down. It'll be just like old times. And please don't stand me up again. Yeah, okay. Bye. He'll be there. Love that gal. Hi, Tony. Hi, Hans! I see you're wearing the nighttime hair at lunch now. Looks good. It's you. The flambe terrorist. Will you not be satisfied till you burn the whole place down? It was an accident. I tried to show the customer a little flair. Jonathan! -You're here to dine? -That's right, old boy! By the way, the eyebrows are growing back nice. Sorry I'm late, I overslept. That's okay. You're only an hour late. Just glad you made it. I love this place. It's so romantic. Yeah! Boy, they did a good job rebuilding the balcony. It went up like a Roman candle. Jonathan, it seems like I was all wrong about you. And I have a way of making it up for you. How would you like to be the chief window dresser at Illustra? You're kidding. Word is out, Jonathan. You're hot. Can you imagine being at Illustra? -They want me? -We want you. What if I told you I had a little help? Fine. There's two of you? You can bring him along. And what if I told you it was a very beautiful woman? I wouldn't mind. Not in the least. I can't do it. -Monday, we'll work together. -You're not listening. You can drive me to work. I miss that quirky little motorcycle of yours. -I'm not taking the job. -What? Why not? If I'm one thing, I'm loyal. Jonathan, you're not seriously turning me down? I'm not the same guy I used to be. I finally found a place where I belong. I'll see you around. I got it! Don't panic! It's just a little one! Bye, Roxie! There's something strange going on in the store at night, Mr. Richards. Every time Rambo sees a mannequin, he gets so scared his little pug tail comes right out his little mouth. -Felix, you were in the war, weren't you? -Airborne. Yes, sir! Did you jump out of a plane and land on your face? Yes, sir! I don't see what it has to do with Rambo. Isn't it obvious Switcher is behind all of this? That skunk! An eternal failure is putting together the most magnificent displays in town. The bum. You say you hear voices, there's no one there. Just him and his dummies. Is someone helping him? Is he a ventriloquist? Some kind of mad genius? Good questions all, sir. Find out the answers! Yes, sir! What about little Rambo? Screw your dog! Let's go, people, clear out. -Clear out, lady! -Stop pushing, okay? I'm going. Come on, Rambo. Tonight we nail that little fart blossom. On behalf of Capt. Clark and the crew we'd like to thank you for flying with Eastern. And we hope you enjoy your fun-filled day in the Caribbean. We deserve this vacation. The sun feels pretty strong. I could use some suntan lotion if someone were willing to rub it on. It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it. We are alone. Okay. So, listen, we find him, get a picture of whoever this woman is and get out. If we can't hire Jonathan, maybe at least we can buy her out. I don't know about you, but I've always wanted to make love in the ladies' shoe department. The smell of fine leather. Can I show you something in your size? What? You mean you took me serious? You're gonna pay for that. Stop it! Don't! Mayday! Mayday, Rambo. Okay, boy. Okay. Show 'em what you're made of. Go get 'em! Rambo! This way! This means a court-martial! You hear that? That must be them. I wish it was us. Come on. We've got them. -Give up? -Never. Switcher. You are one sick puppy. So this is the young lady he dumped you for? Nice. Beauteous! I really should have listened when he asked me for help. Tell me, when you were making love to him did you ever scream, "Don't stop, woody"? My camera. No, this is how I get my inspiration. I create. I can tell by looking at you, you're not the artistic type. You know, Mr. Richards told me to keep an eye on you, but I think I'm gonna handle things my own way. You want to move your sweetheart? That one was for Rambo. Switcher, this is for my Mama! Switcher. Switcher, I'm gonna knock you into the middle of next week! How'd you do that? I was standing behind him, he didn't see me. Teach him to mess with a man and his mannequin. Where'd you go? This is your last chance. We take him or we die trying! I did it! I flew! I really flew! -Are you all right? -Terrific, incredible, I feel great! Did you see how high I was? I just had a thought. You think we should name our first kid Pinocchio? Jonathan are you sure this is right for you? I'm positive. What about you? You've waited a long time. How do you know you're not missing something better 5,000 years later? Nothing could ever be better than being here with you. This is one guy who's never gonna leave your side. The window! Come on. It's almost sunrise. We can't possibly finish it! Don't worry about a thing. But we'll never dress the mannequins in time! That's right! Absolutely scintillating! Beyond genius! It sucks. Fool. I don't believe it's lunch yet. Let's not dally. Felix! What happened? Why don't you tell me? Where's Rambo? It's that Switcher. I caught him doing awful things to a half-naked dummy. Richards, is this your idea of a security guard? -I assure you I had nothing to do-- -You hired him, you fire him. What if he's telling the truth? How can you think that? The man is a lunatic, but I've never known him to lie. He's absolutely right. Mr. Richards, this store has never been more successful. It's all due to Jonathan Switcher. He can put a rubber glove on his head and run naked in the store yelling: "Hi, I'm a squid!" Hi. 'Morning, Mrs. T. Hello, Jonathan. This morning's window is your most brilliant yet. Thank you. What happened here? God only knows. Felix, did you try and take Omaha Beach all by yourself, again? -I was doing what Mr. Richards told me to. -I never said anything. Is that right? Richards when you take Felix to get his last paycheck get your own as well. Mrs. Timkin, you may be our grande dame but I've had serious doubts about a woman your age running this store. I'll appeal to the board. I can't imagine you're appealing to anybody. Don't mess with this old chick, mister. Just pack it up. Jonathan, let's go. And get that dog out of the tree. You can't do this! We'll file a grievance with the union! You're not in a union, you idiot. Hi there, Jonathan. I didn't know you were in there. Excuse me. That's lovely. What the hell are you people doing? Have you seen the latest figures, children? 89 percent. Sales are down 89 percent! Prince and Company is going through the roof! All right. Now, I want this to stop, children. And if it doesn't, so help me God! You are all dead meat! Jonathan, it is my honor to inform you that starting Monday morning you'll be the youngest vice president ever at Prince and Company. -Congratulations. -Hear, hear! -I don't know what to say. -Say, "Thank you." Thank you! Long live Prince and Company. Cheers. Son of a gun. So, Richards was telling the truth. I've been in this business 20 years. Hell, half the guys in this store probably wear lace underwear but, this.... We're talking a Sunday drive into some serious dementia. It's our move now. I'd do anything for Illustra but these pictures could kind of ruin his life. Roxie, I'd never ruin anyone's life. I would, but only if it were absolutely necessary. Roxie, you're not developing a conscience on me, are you? No, I don't think so. Good. Anyway, I don't want to ruin his life I just want to hire him. And now I know how. Hi, Gord. -Miss Thomas, hi. -Please, Jonathan, it's all yours. -Thanks. Men's room is broken. -Of course, dear, whatever you say. -Congratulations. -Thank you. You won't believe what Mrs. Timkin and the board just told me. -Vice president. -Jonathan, that's wonderful! Tina, Moni, he's talking to the dummy again. Nobody deserves it more. I knew this would happen for you. Creative freedom, practically my own boss, maybe some World Series tickets. All right, I'm sorry. I'm going on and on. I couldn't do this without you. I won't take the job unless we can be together. Jonathan you can't worry about what will happen to us. What does that mean? Girls, please, let's not be catty. I simply will not tolerate eavesdropping unless I'm a part of it. I assume my Jonathan is in there. You can't go in. He's got company, if you know what I mean. And who do you think introduced them? At least she'll never say your hips are too fat. Hollywood! Jeez, listen. You know I would never bother you when you're getting a piece of wood but this is muy importante. Your Hollywood needs help. -What's up? -I need your creative muse. I've always thought of myself as hot stuff, the very best at what I do. But seeing you, let's just say it, I'm dirt. Mold me. Shape me. I'm a fast learner. Please, Jonathan, do not let them turn me out into that dark night alone. We can talk about designs and stuff but when I work, I gotta work alone. Of course. I understand perfectly. You're an artiste, and that's the way you work. I can respect that. Jesus. Hollywood, listen, don't worry. You can work as long as you want here, I'm a vice president now. Who's crying? It's either our new vice president, the fairy or the dummy. Emmy, please, you've gotta help me. I can't come alive in front of Hollywood. Besides, you can do it on your own. How can you say that? We do everything together! You can't hold yourself back because of me. Now, come on. Hollywood's waiting. You'll do a masterpiece tonight. Emmy.... I'll be waiting in the window. Jonathan, how about a picture? Mom will think I've switched. Hollywood, you're a genius! I am? Yes! Okay, we need to make a list. Fire away. 30 feet of black nylon cord.... Sounds like my kind of list. Easy, sugar. Okay.... You personally vouch for this guy? He's worked at Prince and Company for 15 years. I think he'll be just fine. He's an imbecile, but.... This is him. Felix, come in. This is Mr. B.J. Wert. Mr. Wert, sir! It's fine. Felix, there are hundreds of mannequins at Prince and Company. Will you be able to identify the one Jonathan Switcher has a romantic interest in? Absolutely, sir. I never forget a name or a face, Mr. Nertz. Good. Felix, we need your help, and if you succeed you will have a cushy new job right here at Illustra. We want to get Switcher's mannequin out of the store and bring her here, secretly of course. A covert operation. I would be happy and proud to lead this mission, sir! Good! It's the most beautiful window I've ever seen. It's all you. -Not this time. -Every time. You're part of me now. I got you in here. Come on. You ready to go? Are you sure you wanna do this? Absolutely. You've been cooped up in that store too long. Besides, who cares what people think? Just put your arms around me and hold on tight. With pleasure. Jonathan! Look, Jonathan, I know about your problem. What problem? You're riding with a mannequin on the back of your motorcycle. What is wrong with this picture? Right, you two haven't met. Roxie, this is Emmy. Emmy, Roxie. Nice to meet.... My God, what am I saying? Jonathan, I wanna give you one last chance. Now, come to Illustra! What is in this for you, Roxie? An office with a view? I don't need Illustra or you. I got friends here, people who care and someone who makes me feel good about myself. Bye, Roxie. You'll be sorry! You're making a big mistake! Roxie.... He's out of his mind! B.J. was right. When I get that dummy, I'm gonna tear her hair out! You know what you need to do right now? You need to put him and this whole nasty affair out of your mind. Now, how is the best way to do that? By having a night of distasteable sex with someone that you care absolutely nothing about. And proudly, I would like to be that person. Fine, let's just go to your place. Really? Drive fast before I have second thoughts! Armand is the wind! Mr. Richards, you'd better put some camouflage on, sir. I am not going to put shoe polish on my face, thank you. Now, could we please get into the store, Felix? Yes, sir. Look at him with a dummy! Who are you to criticize? It's him! It's her! That little prevert! He's stealing her before we can! Don't do anything rash! We'll follow them, and at the right moment, grab her. Don't worry, Mr. Richards, I'm an expert at surveillance. Hang on! Where'd he go? That way. That is it! No more of this surveillance crap. Capt. Felix Maxwell takes this from no mannequin! No! Get us out of here before he gets out of the car! Watch out! Hang on! You're finished, Switcher! You may as well hang up your jockey strap! Let me go! No, Mr. Richards! No! -Be careful, you maniac! -I know! This is for you, Rambo. We got him! -I want to get out. -Geronimo! I don't understand it. This never happened to Armand before. Never! It must be you. You're so cold. You're so unfeeling. Where can I get a mannequin, too? Jonathan. What are you thinking about? The window. Turned out pretty didn't it? It was breathtaking. Emmy Ema Hesire you inspire me. I feel like I could do anything. Windows are only the start. I think we could design an entire city. No one takes the time to build things that have character and dignity. People need that. We could give it to them. I love you, Emmy. I love you, too, Jonathan. I better get into the window. That peckerhead doubled back on me. I saw his motorcycle out front. That dummy of his has got to be here! This is the one! You're positive? Absotively! Wait a minute. This one kinda looks like her, too. I've put my future in the hands of a vegetable. Just get the mannequin. Get the mannequin. -It's over there! -No, this is the door. This is not the door! This is the door. Wait. Mr. Richards did you ever notice how they all sort of look alike? Look at that one. Maybe this is her. This is really interesting. This is art. -It's like theater. -I get it! Excuse me. Good morning, starshine. I sleep alone these days, too, but I am not about to advertise it. Get my clothes? Spent the night? You slept through the whole how-do-you-do. What do you mean? All the girl mannequins disappeared from the windows last night film at 11:00. Yes, my dear your favorite, she is gone. Emmy? Jonathan. That was great! I'm sorry, but you know us special people are destined for heartache. You know what works best for me? Crying shamelessly. Don't do anything drastic! Me, my! Okay, now. Wait a minute. Yes. My car cover, darling. Yes. Yes, girl. Jonathan, wait! Roxie. Roxie Shield. -Can I help you? -Roxie Shield. -She's in conference-- -Thank you. You can't go in there! Security. Jonathan! We were hoping you might drop in. Can I get you something to drink? Where is she, Roxie? She's perfectly safe. Jonathan, let's talk about your future here at Illustra. I think it'll be wonderful to have the team back together again. -What'd you do with her? -Relax, it's just a mannequin. How does $55,000 a year sound to you? -You son of a bitch! -All right, $60,000. I don't think he's of Illustra fiber. Where is she? -You'll never see her again! -Where you going? We also have a very nice profit-sharing plan. We have extremely incriminating photos of you and that little.... Get up, Richards! Get him! Sorry, gotta run. Security alert! Man in leather jacket! Come on! Get.... All units, code 2. Perpetrator on main floor. Roger. Over and out. Come on, Terminator. Duty calls. Excuse me. Roxie! Call the police! The SWATteam. Go away. Felix! Switcher. Terminator lunchtime. Get him! Nice dog. Shit! Switcher! Where did he go? There he is! No! -Get him! -You're finished, Switcher! You've had it, Switcher! Get me out of here! Put me down, you idiot! Let's go. You've had it, Switcher! I'm gonna get you! You're finished, little Switcher! Yoo-hoo boys! Way to go, buddy! Two things I love to do: that's fight and kiss boys. Come on! Come and get me, Sister Maryella. What's the matter, honey? Come on. This is what being a man is all about, honey. You can't come in here. Emmy! Mine's bigger than yours is. Why can't we get that damn water turned off? Shit. Go! Shoot him! Jonathan, you saved me. It's nothing, really. I'm alive. What? He can see me and I'm still alive! You are! Thank you! -Thank you. -What is it? -You're gonna have to love me forever. -I always have, I always will. Move! -Get out of the way, doofus! -Move, damn it! It's a miracle! Stop it! You little creep! Stop touching me! Get away from me! Please don't touch me! Roxie. -Jesus, it's the heat! -Hollywood. Now, this is Emmy. Mama, put the coins on my eyes, 'cause I sure don't believe what I am seeing. There he is. Arrest that man. Who's she? She's who I came for. She's the dummy! I said, "Arrest that man!" Keep your hands off him! Claire, thank goodness you're here. These people.... Shut up! B.J., you really screwed up. What are you talking about? When I fired this idiot the other day, I decided to replace him with one of those camera surveillance systems. I have Richards and this moron on videotape. I was sure you were behind this. You greedy snake! Claire! I want those two arrested for breaking and entering and grand theft. I'll get you later for conspiracy. You can add kidnapping to that, too. -Kidnapping? Who? -Me! Who are you? She's the dummy! This poor man is having a breakdown. Get him out of here! She's the dummy! -She's the dummy! -Please, don't use force. Mamal I want my mamal Mrs. Timkin, those video cameras, did they pick up everything last night? I only saw what I needed to see. Just where did you come from? Roxie, you would never understand. Claire.... There must be some arrangement we can make? Cram it, clown! -Come on, now. -No, boys. You know, I see executive potential here. Roxie, you're fired! You'll never work in this town again! How am I gonna pay my bills, my rent, my new watch, my car.... Just around the corner there's heartache down the street that losers use. If you can wade in through the teardrops you'll find me at the Home of the Blues. I will and cry while my heartbeat keeps time with the drag of my shoes. The sun never shines through this window of mine it's dark at the Home of the Blues. Pass me the bones, Hooker. Come on, lucky number seven. The point is still nine. Let's see that seven. Seven. -Come on. Well done, boy. -Seven. Seven, lose. Nine. Jesus, winner seven. Thirty dollars, shoot it all. I'll take ten of that. -Five here. Come on, don't be shy. -Here's the other ten. Let's go. Coming out. Shooter coming out. Let's see you crap out, Cully. Crap out, crap out. Shooter coming out. Let's see crap out, Cully. Winner seven. You lucky bastard. Sixty dollars. Let it ride. Can he shoot sixty dollars, Hook? Shooter's limit, boys. Come on. Who's in? Twenty, no pass, Cully. Who else gonna be a man? -I got twenty here. Five here. -Fifteen my last. Coming out again. Come on, natural. Let's see those craps. Snake-eyes! Six, and he stays. -Point is six. You gonna make that six, ain't you, Cully? It's your money, Hook. Ten says he passes. Don't be shy? -Any takers? I'll take it. Even money? Slide in another deuce there, Prager. That bet is ten to twelve. The point is six. Ten. You can shoot again. Come on, Cully. How many days in a week? Six days in a week, man. I feel a seven. -Come on, Cully. How many days in the week, Cully? -Seven, seven, Cully. Seven, seven! I told you six, man! -Six! Six, winner, six the hard way. Pay the line and collect the don'ts. A hundred and twenty dollars. Shoot it all. What do you say, boys? -Cleaned out. Cully cheats. He can't cheat with straight dice, Prager. Then how come he always wins, Hooker? Because I'm lucky. -Bullshit! Come on, now, boys. We've had our fun tonight. Cully broke the game, Prager. Well, we'll get ourselves some sleep, what do you say? Yeah. Goodnight, Hooker. See you next week? -It's possible. Anybody got any money left? -Not a cent. Eleven. Winner, eleven. Some day your luck's gonna change, Cully. Hey, stranger. -Come on, get in, Cully. You got something, Cully. Luck, Hooker, I got luck. I don't believe in luck. I've been watching you these past few years. I ain't seen nobody play the odds better. Yeah, well, I tell you there's a lot of guys who know the odds and... Yeah, but you got something extra. I mean, you got the ability to take yourself out of a roll, like you don't even care, knowing what's meant to be will be. And that's what it takes to win big. You gotta have the cool. And you got it. You're young, Cully. There's a whole world out here and you're just seeing it through a bitty crack under the door. You think I can make it in Chicago? I know it. I'm gonna think about it, Hook. Yeah, I'll think about it. It's McMullin on the telephone. Yeah. Yeah. You're late for work again. Dorothy. Hello, Mr. McMullin. What's new with you? Well, there's one thing I want you to talk to about. That son of yours up and quit on me. Have a nice day now. You promised me, Carl Hooker. Now I didn't promise exactly. I said I'd do everything I could. You swore to me over Jimmy's grave that you wouldn't teach my boy to drink and gamble like his father. You lied. Now, first of all, I never swore, and it sure as hell wasn't over Jimmy's grave. And secondly, your husband wasn't much of a gambler. He was a drunk, that's true, and you had a whole to do with that. And whatever it was I said, was before I saw Cully's talent. He's one of the best damn dice players I ever saw in my life. I want my boy back. I want you to tell him... -Dorothy you ain't never gonna get your boy back. I walk 47 miles of barbed wire. I use a cobra snake for a necktie. I had a house on the roadside made from rattlesnake hide. I got a brand new chimney made on top made out of a human skull. Now, come on take a little walk with me Arlene honey and tell me who do you love. Mr. McMullin says you can have your job back. No questions asked, if you call him back by tonight. Ma, I know what you're thinking. You think you think I'm going to turn out just like dad. Well, I ain't. I never worried about that. But I ain't gonna turn out like you either. Now, you call collect if you get in trouble. I'm not going to get in any trouble, Mom. Did you get all dressed up to set me off? Hell, no. I had to go see the doctor over in Evansville. I figured, if you dress sharp, they're less likely to find anything the matter with you. You're crazy, Hook. There you go. Name: Ferguson Edwards. Now, they're expecting you. And I told 'em you're the best damn dice arm they're ever gonna see. What'd you tell 'em that for? Well, they know I exaggerate. This here's my lucky dollar. It's for you. I had this in my pocket the night I won the Packard. I thought you didn't believe in luck. -I don't. I believe in confidence. The illusion of luck. Now, don't you ever gamble with that unless you absolutely gotta win. I don't mean want to, I mean have to. Yeah, don't you be a stranger now. Get in there and just tear 'em up. I will. Take care, Hook. -All right. Thanks for everything. Big town, big town you give a nice Saturday night. Anything, anywhere, anytime that's what I like. I hear the sax screaming the bands are swinging, oh big town. Standing on the corner lately watch the chicks go by. Big town woman got it in her eye. Got me fun real fast, you make it so nice, oh big town. Left my baby, yes I let her down. Love you, baby. Excuse me. I'm looking for a Mr. Ferguson. There's a man here looking for a Mr. Ferguson. Just a minute. It'll be a minute. Grab a seat. Thanks. J.C. Cullen? So, you're J.C. Cullen. They call me Cully, ma'am. My name is Ferguson Edwards. Hooker didn't tell me you were a woman. No, he wouldn't have. Hooker tells me you're about the best dice arm I'm never gonna see. Are you? -Well, I shoot pretty good. You know all the odds on the pass line, the points the side bets, that sort of things -Like I know my name. How many come-out rolls does it take to work out all the odds in whole numbers? Nineteen hundred and eighty. Of those the shooter will pass with a natural 440 times, throw craps on the come-out 220 times, make his point 536 times,... What's the most you've ever won in one night? 157 and change. 157 and change. It's gonna be a pretty so-so night for you here in Chicago. Think you can make it in the big-time? Yes, ma'am. That's what I'm here for. Mister Edwards? Well, if Hooker says he's okay then he must be. Cully, this is mister Edwards, my husband. You'll be working for us now. -Yes, ma'am. Put all your money down on my desk. Okay. I'll just keep it for you so you can have bus fare back to Rockport. All right, give me your dice. Now you're clean. It's the first thing you learn about shooting for us. You gamble with our money. You carry our dice. We know our dice are straight. -Yes, ma'am. We get 70% of everything you win. We'll send Hooker ten percent. Hooker didn't say anything about any 10%. That's the deal. Take it or leave it. Take it. Good. There's a hotel that we own down the street. We'll put you up there. Come back tomorrow about 3 p.m. and we'll get you started. Just a little something to tide you over. Thanks. Save the thanks, son. Wait'll you see what it comes of it. Excuse me. Let me have a pack of Juicy Fruit. That'll be five cents. You might have told me Ferguson was a woman. You didn't ask me. Besides I don't owe you anything. Yes, you do. You owe me nineteen dollars and ninety-five cents. You must be Cullen. -Must be. I'm Harold, the night manager. Mrs. Edwards said to give you a room in the third floor, so you can get some sleep in the daytime. So, maybe you could show me how to shoot dice sometime, could you, Mr. Cullen? -Yeah, sure, Harold. Why don't you call me Cully? I don't go so much for that mister business. Okay then, Cully. You know where I can get a bite to eat around here? Well, I usually eat a place called 'Mother's' right down the block. What's wrong? -Nothing. It's just a fellow once warned me never to gamble in a place called Honest John's and never eat in a place called Mother's. Well, you can suit yourself, but I've been eating there nine years. You can see it ain't hurt me none. -No, I guess not. By the way, there's a little game going on down in the basement, if you're interested. What's the minimum bet? -A buck. I'll go two for the shooter. I picked up sixty dollars in a little crap game at the hotel last night. I already know that. Yeah, well I figured. From now on you shoot only with our money. You got it? Yes, ma'am. I'm sending you out with one of my best arms tonight, Sonny Binkley. He's gonna break you in. I'm not gonna give you the usual routine, because Hooker sent you up. But it Sonny tells me you can't handle the dice or my money, you're gone. You understand that? Sure. -Here's two hundred dollars. Sonny's gonna take you on the Grand Tour. The places where they have the regular games, where you'll be shooting 80% of the time. Good luck. Cullen? -Yes, ma'am? How is Hooker these days? He's fine. He's doing just fine. Get married yet? No, Hooker. He's still chasin' them though. I guess you know how he is. Who's here? Cullen, the new man. I'm just sending him out with Sonny. Mr. Edwards. The odds are with you to make money, as long as you know the dice and the bets. Now in a head's up game, the bets is negotiated. It's mostly even money. It's not like betting against a casino. Lots of times the guys betting' against you don't even know the true odds. I mean, say some sucker lays down a side bet when the point is five. You cover it quick with even money. That's right. Odds is three to two for you, and you only gotta give him even money. A guy like that ain't gonna stay in the game too long. Too bad. All it takes is a couple guys like that betting on instinct and you can start taking their money real regular. Otherwise, the Edwardses wouldn't stay in business. Listen, man, free advice is usually worth exactly what it cost, but you-all comin' in here pretty much like I did, I thought I'd tell you something that's good to remember. This here town is one real place to get hooked on something. It's right over there. They get dope here, man, like you never heard of, and women, man, like you never seen. And booze but like I said, I thought I'd just at least warn you. I appreciate it. What we got here tonight is a big sales convention. I love salesmen. I heard there was a game in here. -Come on in. Hey, Duke. -Sonny. How you doing? -Good. J.C., J.C., this is Duke. How you doing? -Hey, Duke. Come on, let's move the side bets. How you doing? -Hey, how are you? New money in the game? -Yes. New shooter coming out. Get outta that bed, wash your face and hands. Get outta that bed, wash your face and hands. Well, you get in that kitchen, make some noise with the pots and pans. I said, shake, rattle and roll, shake, rattle and roll. Well, you won't do right to save you doggone soul. I believe to my soul you're a devil in nylon hose. I believe to my soul you're a devil in nylon hose. Well, the harder I work, the faster my money goes. I said, shake, rattle and roll, shake, rattle and roll. Well, you won't do right to save your doggone soul. Shake, rattle and roll. Now Cullen, you made 396 dollars in five nights. Not bad for a young man, especially since it's tax free. Yeah, well you didn't do too badly yourself. I figure you made 1.386 dollars off of me and my shooting. Listen to him. The man's been here one week; already the greed is showing through. Hey, that's not what I meant. What did you mean, Cullen? Nothing. I just kinda said it, that's all. Didn't mean for it to sound that way. I hope you're smart enough to figure out Mr. Edwards risked nineteen hundred and eighty dollar to win the thirteen hundred. I hope you also realize that if you were not working for mister Edwards you'd be suspected of being a hustler and a cheat every time you left the game a winner. I'm sorry if I sounded out of line. Arm, if you really got no use for that fat roll there in your hand, why don't you take it on down to the Gem and let some real crapshooters take it away from you? What's the Gem? It's the only game in town where you can't shoot with your own money. It's a Sunday night game backstage at the Gem Club across the street. -Yeah? Well, maybe I will go down there. And maybe I'll break the game, just like I broke those other ones this week. Yeah, maybe you will. Maybe you won't. Why don't you go on and give it a try, Hooker's boy? You want anything else? She don't want you, Cullen. Now, maybe if you was Hooker himself instead of Hooker's boy. Well, I called my baby and told her to be down at the juke joint a-waitin' for me. 'Cause I'm a juke joint Johnny I know every joint in town. I'm a juke joint Johnny and I'm always joking' around. Now, I work all weekend and I draw my pay... You wanna hear something? Yeah, sure. How about this Bob Dicklley record? Doesn't get much air time. Yeah, well, the good stuff they don't play on the radio. You work here? No, I sort of live here. Yeah? Nice place you got here. I live down off State Street. I'm over on Wabash. Yeah? -Yeah. We're neighbors then. I can't decide, Sid. I mean, I want all three, but I've only got a dollar. You decide. No, I can't let you do that. -Are you sure? Yeah, thanks anyway. -Okay. We've got eight thousand of the Elvis records. You can probably get in next week. All right. Thanks. Nine dollars. Let me get the lady's record. Hi. -Hello. I almost missed it. I'm Aggie. Aggie Donaldson. Hi, Aggie. Jack Cullen. -Hi. Where you from, Jack? Around and about. What, like downstate someplace? How come you know so much? 'Cause I'm from downstate myself. -Yeah? Chicago's a great place for music. It's got jazz, country, rock 'n roll. Anything you like. What do you like? I like anything that really cooks. -Yeah? Yeah. I wanna get my own collection of classics, 'cause one of these days I wanna get a job as a D.J. A what? A D.J. You know a disc jockey. Radio announcer. Do they have women disc jockeys? Well, they will. There's a training school right here in Chicago, and they said they'd take me if I pass the FCC test. And the FCC said anyone can take it. Hi, mommy. -Hi. Did you have a good nap? Thanks for looking in on her. Well, she was no problem at all. I brought you a surprise. -What? Your favorite cookies. Why don't you take 'em up to the kitchen, and eat 'em at the counter? Here we go. So... -So, what's your husband do? It's a kind of a long story. Now and then I tell people he was killed in Korea when I'm in the mod for a little sympathy. I never actually married him. We were just a couple of kids. I don't know. It never would have worked. Yeah. -Yeah. It's too bad. Well, you know where I live. It was nice running into you. -Yeah. Hey, Aggie. Could you hold onto these for me? I don't have a record player yet. Sure, Jack. Take care. -You too. Hey, how you doing? What you doin' here? I was looking for you. -How's that? Is that your girl? -Yeah. No shit. I've grown so used to you somehow but I'm nobody's sugar daddy now and I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues. Thank you. Thank you very much. Honey! Hey, honey! Honey! Ginger! Honey! Honey, here. This here's J.C. Cullen. Cully, this is Ginger, my true love. Hello, J.C. -Hi, Ginger. Adele, you know what I'm after. Do you want anything? -Nothing. You know I don't approve of you drinking on the job. You don't approve of me drinking anytime. Ain't my Sonny-boy here the biggest old fuddy-duddy you ever saw? You will, darling. -Yeah, he sure is. Say, Sonny, you ever shoot dice in the progame over at the Gem Club? Sometimes. But it ain't easy to beat. -Why? Because you gotta take and give true odds on side bets. No way to get the odds to work for you. That's a tight game, brother. One of those pros on a hot streak is just liable to whip out a couple.. ...of hundred and just shoot it all. Me, I don't like to gamble. Shoo, ain't that a scream. Sonny don't like to gamble. Honey, you know what I mean. I know what you mean, but I I'll tell you, I feel like going over there tonight. You feel like it? -All right. Just for a few minutes. There goes this week's pay. You think you can get all Jim Bean laid in his grave without me? I reckon so. You think that you can keep your eyes off them girls at the Gem? You keep him on the straight and narrow, J.C. If he can't keep his eyes off of 'em, you make sure he keeps his hands off of them. Okay? -I'll try. It was nice to meet you, J.C. Nice meeting you. -You come around again. You be good. There's only one thing about the Gem Club though. It's a kind of a strange place to shoot dice. Baby, do it again. She ain't real, boy. She ain't real. Hey, hey, let me have some of that. Hi. -Hey, Sonny-boy. Hi. -Hi. How you doin', Sonny? This here is J.C. He's a friend of mine. He works for Ferguson. -Come on in. Roll 'em, Deacon. Lord, grant me a seven to relieve those sinful gamblers of their money. Winner seven. Thank you, Lord, thank you. Who's the nut case? The name's Deacon Daniels. Don't let any of that fool you. He's a first class arm. Shoot it all. -The shooters falls now. A Little Joe from Kokomo. Gentlemen, the point is four. Forty says the Deacon don't. Twenty says he does. You're short. I put down forty. It's a two to one bet. You looking for even money? Let it lay. I guess you know the game. I guess. Is that Ferguson's new flash? I speak English. Well, I'm glad you could make it, Flash. It is fifty dollars to roll the dice. I make all the 'don'ts' at my discretion. And other than that it's head's up game. Okay. Roll 'em. You got it! Four! What, you gonna bet 60 whole dollars, Murphy? Are you sure about that? That's more money than you ever made in a month, isn't it? You got that right. Sorry, Murphy. It's gotta be tough going through life with no balls. Do they let you in the men's room, Murphy? Sunflower's point. There's one guy Will Rogers never met. Well, we are the way God made us. And the way we make ourselves. Amen, brother. James Daniels. And don't call me Jimmy, call me Deacon. J.C. Cullen. You just call me Cully. Who's he? His name is George Cole. He used to be some kind of gangster, or criminal, or something like that. Yeah? Or maybe he has just in the Marines. I never have got it straight. This is his place, as you might have guessed. He ain't been saved yet. How about you? One C. One C. You pay that to the man from Kentucky. I see you have yet to conquer the temptations of the flesh. Viva! -Hi. Excuse me, another young sinner in the need of the comfort of the word. Viva five. The winner five. Six. Spinning around on all sides there. The number is six. Hi. -Hi. All right. No problem. E-oh-leven. You're new here, aren't you? Yes, ma'am. The name's J.C. Cullen. Well, hi, J.C. Hey, seven out. How'd you do? -I've done better. You need change for a dollar, Flash? Five C's to pass. Well, a high roller has arrived. You're faded, sir. Fifty with the shooter. Put it down on the table, Murphy. There's no fly bets here. New shooter coming out. Show 'em how many days in the week. Hundred dollars on my man. How many days in the week? Winner seven for Flash. Throws a natural. One thousand, shoot it all. One thousand faded. Shooter coming out again. Winner eleven. Two thousand dollars. Two thousand faded. Ten, the point is ten. One C on the shooter. Any more side action here? One hundred, looking for two hundred. Four thousand, shoot it all. You better drag your winning while you still got 'em, farm boy. Four thousand faded. Number eleven. Seven thousand, shoot it all. What do you got? -Four thousand. Seven faded. Come on J.C. Make the pass, pass. Eight. The point is eight. Eight's the point. Eight. Come, J.C. Let's see it again. Eight, eight. Shooter falls now. -Come on. E-o-leven. One roll too late. Come on, what you see is what you get. Winner eight. Fourteen thousand. Fourteen thousand? Shoot it all. J.C.'s broke the game. Come on, get your money. Let's get out of here. Come on, Cully. That's fourteen grand. Jim Dandy to the rescue, Jim Dandy to the rescue. Jim Dandy to the rescue, go Jim Dandy, go Jim Dandy. Jim Dandy on the mountain top ten thousand feet to drop. He started giddy on a runaway horse ha ha that's right of course. Jim Dandy to the rescue, go Jim Dandy, go Jim Dandy. Jim Dandy had a girl named Sue she was feelin' kind of blue. Jim Dandy is the kinda guy he never like to see a woman cry. Jim Dandy to the rescue, go Jim Dandy, go Jim Dandy. Jim Dandy to the rescue, Jim Dandy to the rescue. Jim Dandy to the rescue, go Jim Dandy, go. Stop staring at me. You're staring at me, Cullen. I guess I was. I'm sorry. People like to stare at the blind. Makes them think they have an advantage. They think we don't know. But we do know. And I don't like to be stared at. I understand last night you took the Gem game and just broke it. Took 'em for about fifteen grand, I understand. Yeah. I like to see a young man get ahead. Yeah, I remember the time I broke my first big game. Never was a feeling play like that again. I was good, Cullen. God, I was good. Hooker and me we were the best damn dice arms in the whole Midwest. There wasn't a game from Minneapolis to Memphis we couldn't just clean out playing partners. We were something. Let me tell you about the time I lost my eyes. There was this kid, nice, clean-cut young kid from Iowa. When he first came up, he got on a roll like we'd never seen before or since. He just set this town on fire. He got to actually thinking he could will the dice. Like he had some kind of telepathy or something. Hooker and I, we weren't that impressed with this punk. So, we decided to watch him. Didn't really understand the odds, I said. So, we waited him out. He lost his last ten bucks to me. He turned around and asked me would I fade him on credit. Is he kidding me or what? I mean, you know, you never lend money to a man in a crap game. I just looked him straight in the eye, and I said, no, the odds have finally caught up with you. Adios, punk. Well, he went crazy. He got all upset. He started running around like a wild man. He ran over over here, on this east wall and there was a pan of battery acid. And he ran towards it and threw it on us. And a few of us, jus a few, got hit. Hooker gotta little bit on his shirt. And I was his back man and I took it all right right here in my eyes. What happened to the kid? Nothing happened to the kid. The kid got away. The kid ran down an alley. We never saw him again. Pete Carbondale. Yeah, that was his name had a small read heart tattooed on the inside of his right wrist, right here. Eight years I had guys looking for him. We never found him. That's too bad. Yeah, too bad. He was a punk, just like you. And you know something, Cullen. Some day your luck's going to change, just like his. You remember I told you that. Hey, I'm sorry about your bad luck, Mr. Edwards, but I'm not a punk. And I wouldn't throw battery acid in any man's face. I'll be outside, till Ferguson gets back. Well, what did you say the odds were? All right, then put five dollars on the Packers. Right. All right. Bye. Hey. -What do you say, Buddy? Say, how many suits you buy, Flash? Four. I figure I'd better spend some of that money before them 'arms' at the Gem Club get a chance to get it back. You got that right, brother. Okay, let me guess. Who could this be? June Carter? Nope. Must be Ginger McDonald. Your perfume gave you away. Ain't nobody gonna give me away but my daddy. Speaking of which, me and Ginger, we got a little deal worked out. She's gonna be Mrs. Sonny Binkley. No kidding? When? Just as soon as I can get my daddy trained to where can stay in the same room with Sonny and not get into an argument. Hey, Elmo. Hold on one. Elmo! Double Jim Beam and quick. I'll be Johnny Walker Red, straight up. On the house. I tell you. Sonny he's one lucky guy getting a girl like you. Sonny tells me that you are some bigshot with all these crap shooters around. -Well, I wouldn't go that far. I'm pretty good, though. Aggie! -Ellie, how you been? Great. I'm going to be finished in half an hour. Can you wait? Yeah, all right. Hey, Aggie. Hi. What are you doing here? Just hanging around telling lies. Hi, Ginger. How you been? Just great, Aggie. Sonny and me is getting married. Yeah? That's wonderful. So, when are you gonna come over and get your records? Well, I haven't had time to go out and get a phonograph yet. You can come listen on mine if you want. I'm warning you, Aggie. This boy ain't shy. Hey, Sonny. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine. This is Aggie. Aggie, this is Sonny. How you been, Sonny? Fine. I think we best be getting on. Later. I'll meet you out front. So, when are you home, Aggie? This week? I don't know. I gotta get a new job. I'll just try to catch you. You know. All right. Take care. -You, too. I'll see you. What are you doing hanging around with her? What's the matter with her? -Nothing. Don't you wonder why she's so friendly? I don't know. She's just lonely. I guess. Yeah, well, she's got at least one married man to keep her company. You can go better. I tell you true. Going to the Gem Club. Seven out, Duke. Thank you very much.

In or shortly before 1888, music teacher and pianist Edward Issler (1855 - ?) started a four-piece band. The instruments were piano, cornet, flute, and violin. Their first recordings were made in 1888 for Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the phonograph, the first device that could record and play back sound. Soon, more instruments were added, including the trombone and clarinet, but the band started losing popularity to larger groups. After a client (Columbia) of the company Issler recorded most for (the United States Phonograph Co. of Newark, NJ) started its own studio orchestra, the band faded away. They made their last recordings in 1900, although they may have continued performing into the early 1900s. The band's four core members were: Notable recordings. All of Issler's records were recorded on fragile hollow cylinders made of a waxy blend of materials that usually became brown-colored during the making of the blank cylinders, so they are called "brown wax cylinders" because of their shape and usual color. Their actual color can be anywhere from nearly white to a very dark brown. They are about 41⁄4 inches long and 21⁄4 inches in diameter. Not many cylinder records made in the 1890s have survived and the survivors are almost never in like-new condition, so the sound recorded on them is now less clear than what people heard when they were new and there is much more noise mixed in with it. = = = WWE New Year's Revolution = = = New Year's Revolution was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, that was shown every January by the American professional wrestling promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

There are several stories about the origin of Eggs Benedict. Origin. There are several stories about how Eggs Benedict started. There have been many “Benedicts” who have tried to claim credit for the invention of the dish, but they are all frauds. A “benedict” was slang for a newly married gent who had been single for a very long time. Many of these"benedict" did not take well to married life and often sought refuge of strange beds and bedfellows. It is for them that the dish was named. In an interview in "The New Yorker" magazine in 1942, Lemuel Benedict, a retired Wall Street stock broker, said that he had wandered into the Waldorf Hotel in 1894 and, hoping to find a cure for his morning hangover, ordered "buttered toast, poached eggs, crisp bacon and a hooker of hollandaise." Oscar Tschirky, the "maître d'hôtel", was so impressed with the dish that he put it on the breakfast and luncheon menus but substituted ham and a toasted English muffin for the bacon and toast. Craig Claiborne, in September 1967, wrote a column in "The New York Times Magazine" about a letter he had received from Edward P. Montgomery, an American living in France. In it, Montgomery related that the dish was created by Commodore E.C. Benedict, a banker and yachtsman, who died in 1920 at the age of 86. Montgomery also included a recipe for eggs Benedict, stating that the recipe had been given to him by his mother, who had received it from her brother, who was a friend of the Commodore. Mabel C. Butler of Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts in a November 1967 letter printed in "The New York Times Magazine" responded to Montgomery's claim by correcting that the "true story, well known to the relations of Mrs. Le Grand Benedict", of whom she was one, was: Published references. Dates given refer to date of publication. 1898—In "Eggs, and how to use them", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as "split and toast some small muffins; put on each a nice round slice of broiled ham, and on the ham the poached egg; pour over some Hollandaise sauce" 1900—In "The Connecticut Magazine: an Illustrated Monthly, Volume VI", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as "A third variety is called Eggs Benedict. Broil a thin slice of cold-boiled ham cut the size of a small baker's loaf; toast a slice of bread, butter it and moisten with a little water; lay the ham on it and on that a poached egg. Serve individually." 1907—In "Many Ways for Cooking Eggs", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given that starts with the muffins. Unlike yeast leavened English muffins, the recipe muffins use baking powder and beaten egg whites for leavening; however, they are still baked on a griddle in muffin rings. The remainder of the recipe reads "Broil thin slices of ham. Make a sauce Hollandaise. Chop a truffle. Poach the required number of eggs. Dish the muffins, put a square of ham on each, then a poached egg and cover each egg nicely with sauce Hollandaise. Dust with truffle and serve at once." 1914—In the 1914 printing of "The Neighborhood Cook Book", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as "Place a slightly fried piece of ham on a piece of toast, place poached egg on ham, and pour over all a Hollandaise sauce." 1918—In the 1918 printing of the "Boston Cooking-School Cook Book", a recipe for Eggs à la Benedict is given as "Split and toast English muffins. Sauté circular pieces of cold boiled ham, place these over the halves of muffins, arrange on each a dropped egg, and pour around Hollandaise Sauce II, diluted with cream to make of such consistency to pour easily." 1919—In "The Hotel St. Francis Cook Book", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as "Cut an English muffin in two, toast, and put on platter. Put a slice of broiled ham on top of each half, a poached egg on top of the ham, cover all with Hollandaise, and lay a slice of truffle on top of the sauce." 1938—An advertisement for "Haill Hayden's Hollandaise"—a bottled hollandaise sold in a 6-ounce jar for 50¢—runs in "The New York Times". "Here is a sauce such as no man has had before. On tasting it, great chefs have broken their egg-beaters over their knees and wept in jealousy! It is made of butter fragrant from timothy and alfalfa, eggs to which their mothers are still clucking at this hour, lemon and pungent spices! It is not profaned with a drop of oil or any substitutes. Serve it over cauliflower, artichokes, lettuce, eggs Benedict, fish, singing 'Broccoli, Broccoli,' as you eat". 1942—In an interview in "The New Yorker", Lemuel Benedict claims to have originated the dish with an order at the Waldorf Hotel, hoping for a hangover cure. 1967—Craig Claiborne writes in "The New York Times Magazine" that Edward P. Montgomery wrote him a letter to say that eggs Benedict originated with Commodore E.C. Benedict. 1967—In a letter printed in "The New York Times Magazine", Mabel C. Butler responds to Montgomery's claim by stating that Mrs. Le Grand Benedict originated the dish with an order at Delmonico's. 1978—In the Neil Simon comedy film California Suite, Maggie Smith, who won best supporting actress award, laments that she cannot get Eggs Benedict late at night, staying in the exclusive 5 star hotel she is in, playing in fact, an academy award losing actress as a part. Later editions of Charles Ranhofer’s cookbook "The Epicurean" contain a recipe for “Eggs à la Benedick”; however, the recipe is not present in the original 1894 edition.

It was started in 1948. History. The encyclopedia was published by Bracha Peli who had already created another encyclopedia. The man in charge was her son who was named Alexander. A committee decided the aims of the encyclopedia in 1944. Printing of the first part began in 1948. This was the year that Israel became a country. The president of the encyclopedia project was also the President of Israel, Professor Chaim Weizmann. The first photograph in the encyclopaedia was of Israel's Declaration of Independence. The first volume covered the entries for the letter "Aleph" (�) to Australia. The introduction said: ... we will finish publishing all 16 volumes within five or six years... The writing took more than thirty years. The encyclopedia had thirty-two volumes when it was finished. An Index (publishing)|index was not printed until 1985. In 1995 there were large updates of entries dealing with the State of Israel. The supervisor was always Alexander Plai. Its editors were Joseph Klausner, Benzion Netanyahu, Yeshayahu Leibowitz, Nathan Rotenstreich, Yehoshua Gutman, and Joshua Prawer. More than 2500 people wrote the encyclopedia. Some people felt it was very important to be included in the encyclopedia. They would ask the editors to make sure they had an article about them. Other articles caused arguments e.g. Adolf Hitler. The Schocken Publishing House has been working on a new edition of the encyclopedia. Content. The "Encyclopaedia Hebraica" said it was about "General, Jewish, and Israeli" ideas. The encyclopaedia covers all the general topics, but the articles were larger on Judaism, Jews, and Israel. The encyclopaedia includes the Jewishness of the person, even when it is not important. Articles on countries and cities include their history and then a Jewish history. For places which were under Nazi rule an account is given of the Jewish people during the Holocaust. Writers of the encyclopaedia did not hide their Jewish views. The Kingdom of Jordan was not in the first edition. Instead Jordan was included in the article "Land of Israel,". The letter Aleph contains the largest number of articles. The longest article is "Land of Israel" which takes all of volume 6. Next in size is "United States of America". The large size of the aleph articles reflects the enthusiasm of the early editors. It became clear that the encyclopaedia would never come to an end. The plan was changed. The final size of the encyclopaedia was smaller than planned. The woman who owned it was Bracha Peli. She died in 1986. In 1997 the encyclopedia was sold to another company. = = = Milkweed = = = The milkweeds, Asclepias (L. 1753), are a genus of herbaceous perennial, dicotyledonous plants that contains over 140 known species. Milkweeds are an important nectar source for bees and other nectar eaters, and a food source for caterpillars. The weeds are eaten by caterpillars of the monarch butterfly and its relatives, and by other herbivorous insects (such as beetles, and true bugs). These insects are able to feed on the plants despite their chemical defences. Milkweed is named after its milky sap, which contains alkaloids, latex, and several other complex compounds. Some species are toxic. Pollination in this genus is accomplished in an unusual manner, as the pollen is grouped into pollen sacs. The feet or mouthparts of flower visiting insects such as bees, wasps and butterflies, slip into one of the five slits in each flower formed by adjacent anthers. The bases of the pollinia then mechanically attach to the insect, pulling a pair of pollen sacs free when the pollinator flies off. Pollination is effected by the reverse procedure in which one of the pollinia becomes trapped within the anther slit. Milkweeds have three defenses to limit damage by caterpillars and other insects: hairs on the leaves, toxins, and latex fluids. Some more recent milkweed species grow faster than older species. They have the potential to grow faster than caterpillars can eat them. Caterpillars which eat milkweeds, and their adult butterflies, may be protected by the foul taste of the milkweed chemicals. Such butterflies and caterpillars usually show warning colors (see mimicry#warning coloration). = = = Chaim Weizmann = = = Chaim Azriel Weizmann (27 November 1874 in Motal, Belarus – 9 November 1952 in Jerusalem) was the first President of Israel. Weizmann came to the University of Manchester in 1904, where he lectured on chemistry. During World War I, the British forces needed to increase the production of artillery shells. The production was limited by a shortage of acetone, needed to produce cordite. Cordite was used to propel (fire) shells and bullets to their targets. Weizmann developed a production of acetone from the anaerobic fermentation of maize and horse chestnuts by bacteria. As a result, the production of shells rose from 500,000 in the first five months of the war to 16.4 million in 1915. Weizmann was President of Israel from 1948, and he died in 1952. He had worked for years to get agreement for the Israel. = = = Natural History Museum = = = The Natural History Museum (NHM) is a museum in London. It is the largest natural history museum in Britain. It includes the nation's main collections of specimens of life, rocks and minerals. The museum employs scientific staff, conducts research, stores specimens, and manages the public galleries. The NHM is one of the four large institutions on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, London. The others are the Science Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and Imperial College London. History. The NHM was at first a department of the famous British Museum. When the present NHM building was opened in 1881, it was then called the "British Museum (Natural History)" or BMNH. Its head reported to the Director of the British Museum. Not until 1963 did the NHM become fully independent, with its own Board of Trustees, and not until 1992 was it permitted to use its present name. In 1986, the museum absorbed the adjacent Geological Museum of the British Geological Survey, which is to just to the north of the NHM. The museum's galleries were completely rebuilt and relaunched in 1996 as "The Earth Galleries", with the exhibitions in the Waterhouse building retitled "The Life Galleries". The Natural History Museum's own Mineralogy displays remain largely unchanged as an example of the 19th-century display techniques of the Waterhouse building. The newly developed "Darwin Centre" (named after Charles Darwin) is designed as a new home for the museum's collection of tens of millions of preserved specimens, and new work spaces for the museum's scientific staff. Built in two phases, with two new buildings adjacent to the main Waterhouse building, it is the most important new project in the museum's history. Scientific work. The museum employs 300 scientific staff, and has huge collections of fossils, rocks and minerals, as well as the preserved specimens of present-day plants and animals. There are over 70 million specimens in the collections. Data bases of the collections are being developed. = = = Bracha Peli = = = Bracha Peli (1892-1986) was the owner of the "Massada Publishing house" in Israel.

History. When the country was a Spanish colony, the region where the city is now was known as the "Partido de Macorís" ("partido" was an old Spanish subdivision like a municipality). It had the name of "Macorís" because on the mountains to the north of the area lived native people named "Macorís" or "Macorix", different from the Taínos. Those people that were living here founded, on 20 September 1778, the town in a place called "El Rincón de San Francisco" and, for that reason, they gave to the new town the name that it has now: San Francisco de Macorís, that in English would be "St. Francis of Macoris". San Francisco de Macorís was part of La Vega province until 1885 when it became a municipality of the Espaillat province. With the creation of the Duarte province, San Francisco de Macorís became its head municipality, like the capital city, of the new province. Geography. San Francisco de Macorís has a total area of . It has four municipal districts (a municipal district is a subdivision of a municipality). These are Cenoví, Jaya, La Peña and Presidente Don Antonio Guzmán Fernández. San Francisco de Macorís is at to the northwest of Santo Domingo, in the "Cibao Oriental" (in English, "Eastern Cibao"), the eastern part of the Cibao Valley.

It caused hundreds of people to have to evacuate their homes as part of a local state of emergency, and there were hurricane warnings issued for the people of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. How it formed. Hurricane Juan started out as a Tropical Depression near Bermuda. Around 6 hours later it was upgraded to a Tropical Storm. 18 hours after that, it became what we know as the devastating Hurricane Juan. The cause of the hurricane was the temperature of the Atlantic Ocean. Normally, the cool waters of the Atlantic Ocean cause hurricanes to dissipate as they head north, but that day, the water had been 3°C warmer than the average temperature, causing the hurricane to instead, speed up and accelerate, which caused it to hit Halifax and other parts of Nova Scotia with unusually strong gusts of wind reaching over 188 km/h, heavy rain, flying debris, and surf. Damages. Hurricane Juan killed eight people (directly and indirectly), left over $200 million in damages, and had 800,000 - 900,000 people without power for just under 2 weeks (13 and a half days). Point Pleasant Park lost roughly 70% of its trees due to the strong wind gusts that swept them away. Retirement. Because of the damage that Juan caused, the name was retired. It was the first time Canada had put in a request to retire a storm name. In the 2009 storm season, Juan was replaced with Joaquin.

It was a herbivorous relative of the well-known "Dimetrodon". Both had a large, thermal regulating sail on the back. Fossils of "Edaphosaurus" have been found in Europe and North America. "Edaphosaurus" species measured from to almost in length and weighed over 300 kilograms (660 lb). It was slightly taller and stockier than "Dimetrodon", but like its pelycosaur relatives had a small head and a long tail. Skull. The head of "Edaphosaurus" was rather small for its body size. The deep lower jaw likely had powerful muscles and the teeth along the front and sides of its jaws could crop bite-sized pieces from tough plants. The roof of the mouth and the inside of the lower jaw had batteries of peglike teeth. They were a crushing and grinding surface. Early descriptions suggested that "Edaphosaurus" fed on molluscs, which it crushed with its teeth plates. However, paleontologists now think that "Edaphosaurus" ate plants. Lack of wear on the teeth suggests "limited processing of food". Earlier members of the Edaphosauridae lacked tooth plates, and ate insects. = = = Declan Galbraith = = = Declan John Galbraith (born 19 December 1991, Hoo St Werburgh, Kent) is an English singer.

It has over 325,000 articles. = = = Mesonychid = = = Mesonychids were the first mammalian carnivores after the extinction of the dinosaurs. These "wolves on hooves" are an extinct order of carnivorous mammals, closely related to artiodactyls. Mesonychids first appeared in the early Palaeocene with the genus "Dissacus". They went in decline at the end of the Eocene, and became extinct in the early Oligocene. Overview. At the start of the Palaeocene, there were (so far as we know) no large carnivores on land. The surviving mammals and birds evolved into many of the ecological niches previously occupied by dinosaurs and pterosaurs. This process is called adaptive radiation. The mesonychids were the first group to become larger carnivores. They soon had competition. By the later Palaeocene there were several other groups of land carnivores. The giant flightless bird "Gastornis" appeared in the Upper Palaeocene, and the Creodonts had also evolved. The Creodonts became an important order, and would certainly have been serious competitors of the mesonychids. Most important of all, the modern order Carnivora became significant in the Eocene. They were a sister group to the mesonychids, and started as small forms in the Palaeocene. Once they increased in size they would have been direct competitors of the mesonychids. The broken-up Gondwana gave rise to southern continents which the early placental mammals could not get to. Africa and India eventually bumped into Eurasia, and South America sometimes had land connection to North America. All this lead to 'faunal interchange'. Australasia developed its own carnivores, which became extinct only in modern times. Size and habits. Large size was common. The famous "Andrewsarchus" had a skull a metre long, which is much larger than that of the modern Kodiak bear. Mesonychid teeth consisted of molars which were laterally compressed and often blunt and were probably used for shearing meat or crushing bones. Many species are suspected of being fish-eaters, and the largest species may have been scavengers. = = = Andrewsarchus = = = Andrewsarchus mongoliensis (Andrews + Greek �����, "ruler"), was a predatory artiodactyl, closely related to entelodonts, hippos,whales and Mesonychids "Andrewsarchus" lived during the Eocene, about 45 to 36 million years ago. Because "Andrewsarchus" is only known from a skull and a few other bones, the animal's full appearance is unknown, but based on what is known of it and its relatives, it was most likely a stocky hoofed entelodont-like animal. It had a long snout with large, sharp teeth and flat cheek teeth that may have been used to crush bones. Because Andrewsarchus is only known from a skull and a few other bones, whether it was an active predator or merely a large scavenger is open to debate, as is its exact time range. = = = Eurolang = = = Eurolang is an international planned language created by Philip Hunt between 1995 and 1998 in order to be a language for the European Union.

Palm Beach began as a resort town when Henry Morrison Flagler, a founder of Standard Oil, built the Florida East Coast Railway down the coast of Florida. In the center of the community, Flagler built two luxury resort hotels, the Royal Poinciana Hotel and The Breakers Hotel. West Palm Beach was built across Lake Worth as a service town, and is now a major city. Flagler's land for houses was bought by people active in the Gilded Age, and in 1902 Flagler himself built a Beaux-Arts mansion named Whitehall, designed by the New York–based firm Carrère and Hastings and helped start the Palm Beach winter "season" by entertaining visitors. The town was incorporated on April 17, 1911. An area known as the Styx housed many of the servants, most of whom were black. The workers rented their small houses from the landowners. In the early 1900s the land owners agreed to evict all of the residents of the Styx (who moved to West Palm Beach) and Edward R.

These relationships might be called friendships, mentorships, or other. Heterosociality is the opposite. It means that one prefers socializing with members of the opposite sex without bringing romance or sex into the relationship. Eve Sedgwick made the term popular in her discussion of male homosocial desire, but Jean Lipman-Blumen had defined homosociality in 1976 as a preference for members of one's own sex. For example, a close relationship between two men (such as George and Lennie in "Of Mice and Men" (and indeed most of the characters in that book) would be a homosocial relationship. It can apply to single sex schools, prisons, monasteries, but also to simple friendships. The relationship "can" be a sexual one, but a homosocial relationship can occur between homosexuals, heterosexuals or both. It is often used to describe the all-male world of medieval knights, or sailors. While it can apply to both men or women, it is most commonly used to refer to men. Evidence. Rose surveyed males and females between the ages of 20 and 28. Rose asked men and women about how they felt about same and cross-sex friendships. Both men and women preferred same sex friendships. Both men and women said that cross-sex relationships were less helpful, and less loyal than same-sex friendships. Friendship formation was found to be different between cross-sex and same-sex relationships as well. Depending on the culture, and family and social stuctures, same-sex preferences have been found to develop between 3 and 9 years old. (LaFreniere, Strayer,&amp; Gauthier, 1984; Jacklin&amp; Maccoby, 1978; Harkness &amp; Super, 1985) LaFreniere, Strayer, and Gauthier (1984) conducted a three year long study observing fifteen peer groups between the ages of 1 to 6 years old, with 98 boys and 93 girls. As they looked into sex-segregation in childhood, the researchers found that segregation rose with age and that most Western children exihibit these preferences around 3–4 years old. However, in a study by Harkenss and Super, Kenyan children did not have sex-preference in playmates until the ages of 6 to 9 years old. Researchers observed 152 Kenyan children in rural settings and found that this change didn’t occur until parental expectations and customary duties increased. “Just when and how such gender segration appears, is the joint product of the individual and the culturally constructed niche” (Harkness &amp; Super, 1985). The social bias towards members of one’s own sex can develop early in children. Specifically, studies have found that by the early age of 3 or 4, children prefer members of their own sex to members of the opposite sex (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1992). That is, young girls favor girls and women over boys and men. The findings are identical for young boys. Also, Carol Martin (1989) found that boys 4.5 years of age expressed significantly more dislike for a girl depicted as a “tomboy” than a boy depicted as a “sissy”; whereas boys 8.5 years of age express more dislike for a boy depicted as a “sissy”. This age difference suggests that children as young as 4 prefer their own sex regardless of gender-incongruent behavior. Around the age of 8 however, boys begin to show males—devaluing feminine behavior. It has also been shown that children ages 10–12 prefer same-sex socializing. That is, girls favored girls who socialized with other girls and boys liked boys who socialized with other boys. Sexual orientation. Homosociality, by definition, implies neither heterosexuality nor homosexuality. For example, a heterosexual male who prefers to socialize with men may be considered a homosocial heterosexual. The term is often used by feminists to emphasize aspects of solidarity between males. Feminists also identify a close link between female homosociality, feminism and lesbian desire, with Audre Lorde stating "the true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women." = = = 1971 Atlantic hurricane season = = = The 1971 Atlantic hurricane season was from June 1, 1971 to November 30, 1971.

Girls' Generation first performed on M.net "M! Countdown" in July 2007. Even though their performances were never played linked in various combinations to help make a circuit: There are many different types of resistors. Resistors have different power ratings to tell engineers how much power they can handle before they break and how accurate their value is. Connecting two resistors in series results in a higher resistance, and connecting them in parallel makes a lower resistance. Nowadays the electrical industry in many cases uses so called surface-mount technology based resistors which can be very small. Calculating resistance. Where R is the resistor's value Ohm’s Law. The formula for Ohm’s law, V=I*R, states that the voltage drop across a component is equal to the product of the current flowing in the component multiplied by the resistance of the component. When using Ohm’s law, you are able to switch the formula around if needed to find a different outcome: I=V/R or R=V/I Color code. Resistor's values are rated by the colors that are painted on the resistor. The colored bands that are used on the sides of a resistor are black, brown, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, gray, and white. Each color represents a different number. The black band represents the number 0, brown band represents the number 1, red is 2 and so on all the way to white which is the number 9. These numbers are very important in the electronic field. A resistor has multiple bands of color on its side. The most common have four or five but they can range all the way up to 6 per resistor. On a four band resistor, the last band is usually gold or silver. The gold band represents a positive or negative 5% tolerance. The silver band on a resistor represents a positive or negative 10% tolerance. Hold this band on the right side, and read the colors from left to right. The first two bands are read as the numbers that they represent in the color code. The third band acts as a multiplier for the other bands, so for example, if the third band was an orange band which is a 3, it would mean you multiply the two numbers by 1000. In short you add the value of the color in zeros at the end, so add three zeros. Online calculators are available to calculate color codes. When the color codes are put into the calculator, it will automatically calculate the value of the resistor, along with the tolerance. Applications. Resistors are used in many different ways. First of all, they are put in circuits to protect components from damage such as LEDs. They also control the amount of current flowing in a circuit, for example, if you want less current to flow you would put in a resistor with a higher value. Resistors can also split voltage between different parts of a circuit and control time delay. Electric heaters use very large resistors to turn electricity into heat. Usually, engineers try to make resistors heat up as little as possible to not waste power, but in a heater, this "waste" is a good thing. You can also use resistors for soldering electronics. Resistor materials. Many different types of resistors are made. They are made with a resistive material encased in a non-conductive material, such as plastic or ceramic. Fixed resistors are usually made of carbon encased in a plastic cylinder, with a connecting wire on either end. Most resistors used in electronics today are carbon resistors. Older resistors were made of other poorly conducting metals, in order to restrict the flow of charge. = = = Death Star = = = The Death Star is a fictional moon-sized space station and superweapon.

The idea of the Death Star as a large, spherical space station was the same in all the models. The sound of the Death Star counting down until it fires comes from the "Flash Gordon" movies from the 1930's. Making a Death Star that was only partly built (but was still powerful) was a problem for Industrial Light &amp; Magic's modelmakers for '. Only the front side of the 137-centimeter model was finished. The image was flipped horizontally for the final movie. The Death Star is a Super Weapon used by the Galactic Empire in Star Wars.

The first Death Star was shown in its finished form in "". It was commanded by Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing). The Death Star was the Galactic Empire's "ultimate weapon". The movie begins with Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) attempting to take the station's plans to the Rebel Alliance, wanting to help them destroy the Death Star. Onboard her vessel, she was captured by an imperial ship and taken captive to the Death Star. There, Tarkin tries to make Leia reveal the location of the rebel base by threatening the use of the Death Star to destroy Leia's home world, Alderaan. She tells them a location but not the real one, but Tarkin has her planet destroyed anyway. Later, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his small crew are also captured and taken to the station, escaping with Leia shortly after. In the movie's main battle scene, the force ghost of Obi-wan Kenobi tells Luke to use the "Force" to help him direct proton torpedoes from his x-wing into the Death Star' reactor core and not with his ship's targeting system. Luke obeys and successfully launches the torpedoes into the core. This ultimately resulted in the destruction of the battle station. "Return of the Jedi" takes place four years later. At this time, the Empire is building a new Death Star. It is half-finished in the movie. Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) and Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) send the Rebels false information with the intention of trapping the Rebels, saying that the station's weapons systems are not fully functional. They also want to get Skywalker on board so they can turn him to the dark side of the Force. In the movie's climax, Vader throws Sidious down one of the station's reactor core, apparently killing him. However, Sidious fires a large amount of sith lightning during this process and critically damages the electronics on Vader's suit that keeps him alive. Luke tries to get his father out of the battle station but he dies shortly after. Luke then takes Vader's body and leaves the Death Star just before it is destroyed by Lando Calrissian on board the "Millennium Falcon." The first Death Star is also dealt with in the "Star Wars" prequel trilogy. Its schematics are shown in '. At the end of ', the Death Star is shown starting to be built. = = = Doctor of Philosophy = = = The Doctor of Philosophy, (PhD, Ph.D., DPhil or D.Phil.) is a degree which a person gets from a university by finishing a doctorate program. In many areas of study, the PhD / DPhil is the highest degree that a person can earn. This is called the "terminal degree". There are PhD / DPhil degrees for many different fields. Examples of these include PhDs / DPhils in literature, philosophy, history, science, mathematics and engineering. Some PhD / DPhil degrees have existed for hundreds of years, such as a PhD / DPhil in Canon Law. Other PhD / DPhil degrees were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the PhD / DPhil in computer science. Requirements for degree. To be admitted to a PhD / DPhil program, a person usually has to have completed their Bachelor's degree or master's degree that is related to the PhD / DPhil degree. For example, a person applying to be admitted to a PhD / DPhil degree in theater would normally have to have a master's degree such as a Master of Arts (MA) degree in theater, English literature or a related area. Elements of a PhD / DPhil degree. The PhD / DPhil degree usually takes between three and six years of full-time study to complete. They may or may not require a master's degree beforehand. Many PhD / DPhil degrees begin with a period of graduate courses. After the PhD / DPhil student has taken these courses, they take examinations to test what the student knows about their area of study. After the student passes the exams, they begin to do original research. The product is a long research report called a dissertation (or a "thesis"). Some PhD / DPhil degrees also require students to pass exams in languages (such as French, German or other languages). Many PhD / DPhil students teach undergraduate students or assist professors with research during their PhD / DPhil studies. As a requirement for university teaching. Requirements for university teaching vary in different subjects and in different countries. A PhD / DPhil is necessary or usual to become a university professor in many fields, especially in science. However, many famous professors have not had higher degrees, though that is less common today. In some fields, there is no PhD / DPhil, and so another degree is required to become a university professor. For example, the highest degree in Fine Arts fields such as printmaking or graphic design is the Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree. A person with an MFA degree can become a university professor in some Fine Arts fields. = = = Global 200 = = = The Global 200 is the list of ecoregions identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) as priorities for conservation. According to the WWF, an ecoregion is defined as a "relatively large unit of land or water containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species, dynamics, and environmental conditions (Dinerstein et al. 1995, TNC 1997)." The WWF assigns a conservation status to each ecoregion in the Global 200: critical or endangered; vulnerable; and relatively stable or intact. Over half of the ecoregions in the Global 200 are rated endangered. = = = Ecoregion = = = An ecoregion (ecological region), sometimes called a bioregion, is the next smallest ecologically and geographically defined area beneath "realm" or "ecozone". Ecoregions cover relatively large area of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct natural communities and species. When defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the boundaries of an ecoregion approximate the original extent of the natural communities prior to any major recent disruptions or changes. The WWF has identified 825 terrestrial ecoregions, and approximately 450 freshwater ecoregions across the Earth. World Wide Fund for Nature's full definition of an ecoregion, which is widely accepted and used, is the following: The "Global 200" is the list of ecoregions identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) as priorities for conservation. Terrestrial. A terrestrial ecoregion is a certain area of land which is different from the area near it. It has a distinct climate, geology, type of soil, water availability, and distinct living species (the animals and plants that live in the ecoregion). For example, one ecoregion can be a desert. It would have sand, very little water, very hot temperatures during the day and very cold at night. The plants could be just bushes, small trees, cactii. The animals could be scorpions, little mammals, spiders. Or for example, an ecoregion could be a tropical forest It would have warm temperatures all day, a lot of rainfall all year, a huge river crossing, and a very organic soil. The plants could be huge trees or ferns. The animals could be insects, birds, fish and apes. Marine. Marine ecoregions are regions of the world's oceans, that are defined by the WWF, to help activities for saving marine ecosystems. The scheme used to find out these ecoregions is more or less the same as that for terrestrial ecoregions. Major habitat types are identified: polar, temperate shelfs and seas, temperate upwelling, tropical upwelling, tropical coral, pelagic, abyssal, and hadal (ocean trench) — which correspond to the terrestrial biomes. Major biogeographic realms, analogous to the seven terrestrial ecozones, represent large regions of the ocean basins: North Temperate Atlantic, Eastern Tropical Atlantic, Western Tropical Atlantic, South Temperate Atlantic, North Temperate Indo-Pacific, Central Indo-Pacific, Eastern Indo-Pacific, Western Indo-Pacific, South Temperate Indo-Pacific, Southern Ocean, Antarctic, Arctic, and Mediterranean. The classification of Marine ecoregions is not developed to the same level of detail and comprehensiveness as that of the terrestrial ecoregions; only the priority conservation areas of the Global 200 are listed. See Global 200 Marine ecoregions for a full list of marine ecoregions (World Wide Fund for Nature). Freshwater. Freshwater ecoregions are the freshwater habitats of a particular geographic area, including rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands. Freshwater ecoregions are distinct from terrestrial ecoregions, which have biotic communities of the land, and marine ecoregions, which are biotic communities of the oceans. The WWF speaks of seven major habitat types of freshwater ecoregions: Large rivers, large river headwaters, large river deltas, small rivers, large lakes, small lakes, and xeric basins. Several freshwater ecoregions are listed in the Global 200, the WWF's priority ecoregions for conservation of biodiversity. = = = Wetland = = = In physical geography, a wetland is an environment that combines the properties of land and water. Wetlands are a distinct kind of ecosystem. The combination of wet and dry areas means that many more different kinds of plants, animals and insects may live in a wetland than compared to other types of habitat. Because of this great biodiversity, several important wetlands are among the Global 200 ecoregions that the World Wide Fund for Nature listed for conservation to try to get people to protect them. As well, Ramsar Convention is adopted in 1971 for protection of wetland. = = = Marsh = = = In geography, a marsh is a type of wetland. It has grasses, rushes, reeds, typhas, sedges, and other herbaceous plants (possibly with low-growing woody plants) in a context of shallow water. A marsh is different from a swamp, which has a greater proportion of open water surface, which is generally deeper than a marsh. In the US, the term 'swamp' is used for wetland dominated by trees rather than grasses and low herbs. The water of a marsh can be fresh, brackish or saline. Coastal marshes may be associated with estuaries and along waterways between coastal barrier islands and the inner coast. Estuarine marshes often are based on soils consisting of sandy bottoms or bay muds. Marshes are critically important wildlife habitat, often serving as breeding grounds for a wide variety of animal life. = = = Ulan-Ude = = = Ulan-Ude (Russian:�����-����; Buryat: �����-���), formerly Verkhneudinsk (), the capital city of the Buryat Republic, Russia. The city is located about 100 km south-east of Lake Baikal. It sits at the foot of the Khamar-Daban and Khrebet Ulan-Burgasy mountain ranges, next to the confluence of the Selenga River and its tributary, the Uda. The city is divided into two parts by the Uda. Population 359,391 (2002 Census); 352,530 (1989 Census). It is the third largest city in East Siberia. It is served by Ulan-Ude Airport (Mukhino) as well as the smaller Ulan-Ude Vostochny Airport. Ulan-Ude was founded in 1666 by the Russian Cossacks. Due to its geographical position, the city grew rapidly and became a large trade centre which connected Russia with China and Mongolia. There are old merchants' mansions richly decorated with wood and stone carving in the historical center of Ulan-Ude, along the river banks. They represent beautiful examples of Russian classicism. There is also a large and highly unusual head of Lenin in the central square. = = = Pelagic zone = = = The pelagic zone is the open sea or ocean that is not near the coast. The name comes from the Greek ������� ("pélagos"), which might be translated as "open sea". To make this clear, seas around continents have continental crust beneath them. They are shallow. Seas away from continents can be very deep, and do not have continental shelves beneath them. Sub-zones. The pelagic (or open ocean) zone is divided into a number of sub-zones: The last three zones are similar in character, and some marine biologists count them as a single zone or consider the latter two to be the one zone. Some define the hadopelagic as waters below 6000 meters, whether in a trench or not. = = = Vitamin A = = = Vitamin A is a vitamin, a group of organic chemicals including retinal and several carotenoids. The human body does not make these chemicals, and must take them from food. Egg yolks and liver are both rich in vitamin A. Many parts of the body need vitamin A. For example, vitamin A helps sight and is good for the immune system. It is also important for a growing embryo. �-carotene, a provitamin found in foods like carrots can be converted to vitamin A. The efficiency of the conversion depends on genetics and fat consumption. Too little vitamin A is dangerous to health. People who do not get enough of the vitamin may lose the ability to see in poor light and suffer from a weakened immune system. They may also have problems with memory, because vitamin A is important for the brain. People with malnutrition often have too little vitamin A. This is common in poor countries. Hypervitaminosis A. Too much vitamin A is also dangerous to one's health. It is a condition known as hypervitaminosis. Vitamin A is not soluble in water, and the human body can not get rid of the excess vitamin A easily by urination. Too much vitamin A can make someone very sick. People may get too much vitamin A from taking too many vitamin pills or from eating too much A-rich food like liver. What applies to humans applies to all mammals at least. Some large predators, such as the big cats, seem not to eat their preys' livers. On the other hand, polar bears apparently do so, and they store vitamin A in their liver cells. However, they have long, sometimes very long, periods between kills. In contrast, African big cats kill about every three or four days, and they do seem to avoid eating the preys' livers. = = = Vitamin D = = = Vitamin D is a hormone. It is a steroid which is made in the body under the right conditions. To make it, the body needs sunlight, which acts on the lower layers of the skin. However, if the body does not make enough, it can be found from food sources in tiny amounts. In fact, many countries add it automatically to certain foods like milk. Supplements can be easily found in most developed countries. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient. This means that any portion not used immediately is stored in fat tissue for future use. What it does. As a hormone, Vitamin D does many things in the body. It was first discovered as the substance which could prevent and cure rickets. It controls the levels of calcium ions and phosphates in the blood, as well as calcium and magnesium absorption in the intestines. It helps bones grow and form. It is also good for the immune system. Different kinds. In total, there are 5 different forms, D1 to D5. The most common ones are D2 and D3 (see images). D3 (also called cholecalciferol) is the kind produced by the body. It is also found naturally in marine oils and in lanolin (oil from sheep's wool), the most common source for supplements. D2 (also called ergocalciferol) is produced by fungi. It is similar to D3, but not exactly the same. Getting enough. D3 is made in the skin from cholesterol, and changed into a more active form by the liver. However, the skin will not make it unless enough ultraviolet light shines on it. As sunlight contains ultraviolet light, getting enough sun is one way of getting enough D3. Many things can keep the skin from making enough D3. Winter sunlight may be too weak. Melanin, which protects skin from damage, also keeps it from making D3, which is why people with darker skin are more prone to deficiency. Older people are also prone, because aging skin makes less D3, even with enough sunlight. Clothing, glass, sunscreens and sunblocks also shield the skin from getting enough ultraviolet light to make D3. It is hard to know how much supplemental Vitamin D, if any, is needed. Less than 25 micrograms (1000 IU) per day, but up to 100 mcg (4000 IU) per day is considered safe. A recent panel of Vitamin D researchers concluded that "at least" 20-25 mcg (800-1000 IU) per day would help most adults. Few foods naturally contain much D3. Fish do, especially oily ones, such as salmon, sardine and mackerel. Many kinds of edible mushrooms contain some D2, like shiitake. Mushrooms grown in full sunlight tend to have more. = = = Biome = = = In ecology, a biome is a major regional group of distinctive plant and animal communities best adapted to the region's physical natural environment, latitude, elevation, and terrain. A biome is made up of ecoregions or settlements at stable steady state and all associated transitional, disturbed, or degraded, vegetation, fauna and soils, but can often be identified by the climax vegetation type. The biodiversity characteristic of each biome, especially the diversity of fauna and subdominant plant forms, is a function of abiotic factors and the biomass productivity of the dominant vegetation. Terrestrial biomes with higher net primary productivity, moisture availability, and temperature. A fundamental classification of biomes is into: Biomes are often given local names. For example, a temperate grassland or shrubland biome is known commonly as "steppe" in central Asia, "savanna" or "field" in southern Africa, "prairie" in North America, "pampa" in South America and "outback" or "scrub" in Australia. Sometimes an entire biome may be targeted for protection, especially under an individual nation's "Biodiversity Action Plan". Terrestrial biomes. Climate is a major factor determining the distribution of terrestrial biomes. Among the important climatic factors are: Biodiversity generally increases away from the poles towards the equator, and increases with humidity. The most widely used systems of classifying biomes correspond to latitude (or temperature zoning) and humidity. Udvardy system. In 1975, Miklos Udvardy published a system of biogeographic provinces that were divided into 12 terrestrial biomes. Bailey system. Robert G. Bailey developed a biogeographical classification system for the United States in a map published in 1975. Bailey subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of North America in 1981, and the world in 1989. The Bailey system is based on climate, and is divided into four domains (Polar, Humid Temperate, Dry, and Humid Tropical), with further divisions based on other climate characteristics (subarctic, warm temperate, hot temperate, and subtropical, marine and continental, lowland and mountain). WWF system. A team of biologists developed an ecological land classification system for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) that identified 14 biomes, called major habitat types, and further divided the world's land area into 867 terrestrial ecoregions. This classification is used to define the Global 200 list of ecoregions identified by the (WWF) as priorities for conservation. The WWF major habitat types are as follows: Other biomes. The Endolithic biome, consisting entirely of microscopic life in rock pores (small holes in rocks) and cracks, kilometers beneath the surface, has only recently been discovered and does not fit well into most classification schemes. = = = Vitamin E = = = Vitamin E (which is also called Tocopherol or Tocotrienol, E307, E308,E309) is a vitamin. There are eight forms of it, E1 to E8. It can be found in vegetable oils. Very often it is also added to lotions and creams for the skin. It is supposed to help the healing of the skin, after burns and injuries, and lower the risk of heart disease and cancer. Some research suggests that vitamin E has anti-aging benefits. = = = Vitamin K = = = Vitamin K is a vitamin which is soluble in fat. It is probably best known for its role in the coagulation (clotting) of blood. However, it also serves other important functions in the body. Vitamin K was discovered by a Danish chemist named Henrik Dam. He won the 1943 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering its key role in the coagulation of blood. Since that time, Vitamin K's role in other physiologic functions has become known. One of the most important is its role in controlling where calcium goes in the body. Without Vitamin K, there would be a loss of blood when a person bleeds, which can lead to unconsciousness or even death. Vitamin K can be found in green vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, broccoli or cabbage. = = = B vitamins = = = The B vitamin complex (also called B vitamins) are a group of 8 vitamins. They have an important job in the metabolism of cells. Each B vitamin is a cofactor (a coenzyme) for some key metabolic processes or it is a precursor needed to make one. Originally, people thought they were just different forms of one vitamin (as with Vitamin D, for example). Later it turned out that they are separate vitamins that often can be found together. They are Vitamin B1/Thiamine, Vitamin B2/Riboflavin, Vitamin B3/Vitamin P/Vitamin PP/Niacin,Vitamin B5/Pantothenic acid, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B7/Vitamin H/Biotin, Vitamin B9/Vitamin M/Vitamin B-c/Folate and Vitamin B12. They are required for growth, and proper functioning of nerves and muscles. B vitamins are found in meat, milk, whole grains and fresh vegetables. Vitamin B deficiencies have been shown to cause the following symptoms: Well-known medical syndromes caused by thiamine deficiency are beri-beri, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome (WKS), and optic neuropathy. = = = Subarctic climate = = = Places with a subarctic climate (also called boreal climate) have long, usually very cold winters, and short, warm summers. It is found on large landmasses, away from oceans, usually at latitudes from 50° to 70°N. Because there are no large landmasses at such latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, it is only found at high "altitudes "(heights) in the Andes and the mountains of Australia and New Zealand's South Island. These climates are in groups "Dfc", "Dwc", "Dfd" and "Dwd" in the Köppen climate classification This type of climate has very big changes in temperature throughout the year. In winter, temperatures can drop to -40 °C (also -40 °F) and in summer, the temperature may go above 30 °C (86 °F). But the summers are short, as there are no more than three months of the year with an average temperature of at least 10 °C (50 °F). However, at least one must have an average temperature of at least 10 °C (50 °F) . In addition, the coldest month must be below 0°C (32°F) The subarctic climate is in between the humid continental climate and the polar climate. The subarctic climate is found in the these places: With 5–7 months in a row where the average temperature is below freezing, all water in the soil and subsoil freezes several feet deep. In the colder parts of this climate, summer warmth is not enough to "thaw" (unfreeze) more than a few feet on the top of the soil, so there can be "permafrost"(soil that is frozen forever). When the ice melts in the summer, 2 to 14 ft (0.6 to 4 m) of soil can thaw, depending on the latitude and the type of soil. Some subarctic climates near oceans (such as southern Alaska and the northern edge of Europe), have milder winters and no permafrost, so it is easier to farm there. Summer is very short; it has about 45 to 100 days at most, and in a lot of places, the temperatures can go below freezing (32 °F or 0 °C) at any time of the year, even in the summer. Vegetation (plants) in a subarctic climate usually has low diversity (only a few different types of plants grow), because only "hardy" (very tough) species can survive the long winters and make use of the short summers. Trees are mostly evergreen conifers, because few "broadleaved" (big leaves) trees can survive the very low temperatures in winter. This type of forest is also known as taiga. The word "taiga" can also be a name for the climate itself. A lot of plants grow in the taiga (even if there are only a few different kinds of plants), so the taiga (boreal) forest is the largest forest biome on the planet, with most of the forests in Russia and Canada. It is usually very hard to farm in subarctic climates, because the soil is "infertile" (it doesn't have the nutrients that many plants need to grow) and because of the many swamps and lakes that ice sheets make, and only very tough crops can survive the short growing seasons. On the plus side, the days last longer in the summer as you get closer to the poles. So the plants that can grow get a lot of sunlight. Potatoes, strawberries, blueberries and hay for animals grow well. Special varieties of other plants may grow as well. There is very little precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or hail); no more than 15 to 20 inches over an entire year. Rain and snow may stay above ground until the ground melts. This means that when the precipitation does soak into the ground, it can be very wet and muddy. Close to the Earth's poles and the water around the poles, the warmest month has an average temperature of less than 10 °C (50 °F), and the subarctic climate turns into a tundra climate, which is even worse for trees. Here are some places with subarctic climates: Some places in the climate group "Dfd" (a very, very cold subarctic climate) are: = = = ONS coding system = = = The ONS coding system is a system used in the United Kingdom for dealing with census and other statistical data. It is used by the Office for National Statistics as a way to label each area of England and Wales. It is also used for parts of Northern Ireland. The system uses a code for the larger census areas, counties and districts. It then breaks those areas down into smaller areas within the larger areas. Each of the smaller areas get a code that is based on the larger area. Areas are divided in this way until they get to the smallest size used for census data. An area must have at least 40 households, but they try to not divide an area into a size smaller than 100 households. = = = Michael Tippett = = = Sir Michael Kemp Tippett OM CH CBE (2 January 1905 – 8 January 1998) was an English composer. He is one of the greatest and most original composers of the 20th century. His work was published for the first time when he was 30 years old, and only become famous when he was about 40. The rhythms in his music and the tonality are very original. He is remembered for many kinds of music: opera, oratorio, orchestral music, chamber music and piano music. His oratorio "A Child of our Time" is especially well-known and often performed by choirs. His life. Tippett was born in Eastcote, Middlesex and spent his childhood in a small village in Suffolk. His father had retired and had bought a hotel in Cannes, France. Michael and his brother learned to speak French when they were very young. He was sent to school in Edinburgh when he was 13 but did not like it there so he went to the local Stamford Grammar School in Lincolnshire. The only musical training he had as a child were his piano lessons. When he had finished his school years he decided he wanted to be a composer, but neither he nor his parents knew the best way to become a composer. He started having more piano lessons. Then someone said he should go to the Royal College of Music. He went there at the beginning of the summer term, 1923 and spent five years there studying music. He then moved to Oxted in Surrey and for six years he taught French at a school. He composed in his free time. In Oxted there was a small choir. Tippett had sung with them while he was a student. Now he became their conductor and he learned a lot about music by getting the choir to sing English madrigals and other music including operatic music. He took some more lessons in composition from R.O.Morris at the RCM. He went to music camps where he learned more ideas about politics than about music. He agreed with a lot of the ideas of Trotsky. He became a pacifist and in 1940 he registered as a conscientious objector. In 1943 he spent three months in prison because he refused to help with the war effort. Meanwhile, Tippett had become director of music at Morley College. He made the choir there into one of the best choirs in England. He played a lot of music by Henry Purcell whose music was not as well known then as it is now. He also worked with young musicians who later became famous: the tenor Peter Pears, the countertenor Alfred Deller and the Amadeus String Quartet. In 1951 he became a broadcaster with the BBC. Some of the talks he gave on the radio were published in his book "Moving into Aquarius". He continued a brilliant career as composer, conductor and broadcaster. He was director of the Bath Festival which he helped to improve a lot. He became internationally famous, especially in America. His "Symphony no 4" and his oratorio "Mask of Time" were written for performances in America. His last opera "New Year" was written jointly for the Houston Grand Opera, Glyndebourne and the BBC. He was made a CBE in 1959, knighted in 1966, made a Companion of Honour in 1979 and received an Order of Merit in 1983. He received many honours from universities. Tippett died from pneumonia in London in 1998 after travelling to Stockholm for a festival which included all his works except his stage works. Although he was able to return home he died shortly afterwards. His music. It is unusual for a great musician to begin studying music properly at the age of 18. However, he was old enough to realize that he had a lot to learn. He studied counterpoint and was influenced by the way Classical composers had shaped their music. Beethoven especially was an inspiration for him. One of his best-known works is the "Concerto for Double String Orchestra" (1938-1939). It shows his love of folk music as well as interest in English music of the Renaissance. This music is exciting because of its beats, which keep changing, and its dance-like character. "A Child of Our Time" was an oratorio which used negro spirituals. He combined these with his own style of music. It is about something that really happened in 1938. A 17-year-old Jewish Polish boy killed a Nazi diplomat because the Nazis had taken away his parents. The Nazis were angry and killed lots of Jews in return. It was something which helped to lead to the World War II. Tippett’s music is about the cruelty that humans show towards one another. Tippett’s operas include "A Midsummer Marriage" (started 1946, first performed 1955), "King Priam" (1958-61), "The Knot Garden" (1966-69) and "The Ice Break" (1973-76) and "New Year" (1989). He wrote several choral works. His orchestral works include 4 symphonies, a "Fantasia concertante on a Theme of Corelli" for strings (1953), a "Piano Concerto" (1953-55) and a "Concerto for violin, viola and cello" (1979). His chamber music includes piano sonatas and string quartets. His writings. Tippett published many of his writings. "Moving into Aquarius" consists of talks given on the BBC. In his autobiography "Those Twentieth Century Blues" he discusses many of his problems, including his homosexuality, which in his earlier years he could not talk about because it was illegal at that time. = = = Claw = = = A claw is a sharp object. It is found at the end of a toe or finger in many mammals, birds, and some reptiles. The word "claw" is also used in reference to an invertebrate. For example, the chelae of crabs and lobsters are often called claws or pincers. A claw is made of hard protein called keratin. They are used by some meat eating mammals such as cats to catch and hold prey, but they may also be used for other things such as digging, climbing trees, and so on, in those and other species. Similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead. Arthropods. The correct name for an arthropod's 'claw' is chela (plural "chelae"). Legs that have a chela are called chelipeds. Chelae are also called pincers. Tetrapods. In tetrapods, claws are made of keratin and have two layers. The unguis is the outside hard layer, which has keratin fibers arranged perpendicular to the direction of growth and in layers at an angle. The subunguis is the soft, flaky layer, and the grain is parallel to the direction of growth. The claw grows outward from the nail matrix at the base of the unguis and the subunguis grows thicker while traveling across the nail bed. The unguis grows outward faster than the subunguis to make a curve and the thinner sides of the claw wear away faster than their thicker middle, making a more or less sharp point. Tetrapods use their claws in many ways, such as grasping or killing prey, digging, climbing, and hanging. Birds. A talon is the claw of a bird of prey, which it uses to hunt. The talons are very important. If they did not have them, those birds might not be able to catch their food. In any event, birds often need to carry their prey back to the nest. Nests are safe places where prey can be shared with chicks or with their partner. In its nest a bird can tear prey apart and feed pieces to its ever-hungry chicks. Mammals. A nail is similar to a claw but it is flatter and has a curved edge instead of a point. A nail that is big enough to hold weight is called a 'hoof'. Every so often, the growth of claws stops and restarts, just like the growth of hair. In hair, this causes the hair to fall out and it is replaced by a new one. In claws, this results in an old layer, and it breaks off. This takes several months for human thumbnails. Cats are often seen working old layers off on wood or on boards made for the purpose. Ungulates' hooves trim themselves when they walk on the ground. Domesticated equids (horses, donkeys and mules) usually need regular trimming by a farrier. In the wild, horses regularly travel much further than do domestic horses. Many predatory mammals have claws that can hide inside the animal's paw, especially animals such as the cat. Primates. A primate's nail only has the unguis; the subunguis has disappeared. Similar to the tail, the claw in apes is not needed. However, in some primates, the subunguis has redeveloped to make a claw-like structure. These certain animals do not have actual claws; instead the unguis appears normal along with a thick growth of subunguis. Some lemurs have a toilet-claw which they use for scratching and grooming. = = = Max and Moritz = = = Max and Moritz (German: Max und Moritz) are two naughty little boys in a story by Wilhelm Busch. The stories were written in 1865 and are still extremely popular in Germany. Wilhelm Busch was an artist as well as a writer. He wrote a lot of stories in rhyme and made drawings to go with them. "Max and Moritz" are stories like these. The two boys get up to lots of naughty pranks. There are seven stories (seven pranks). In the final prank they are caught and come to a sad end. In the 19th century writers had to show that bad behaviour would be punished in the end. The seven stories are stories with a moral. The seven stories. In the first story the boys tie pieces of bread onto pieces of string and put it down where an old woman, Widow Bolte, keeps her hens. The hens each try to swallow a piece of bread, which sticks in their throats and they end up hanging in the tree and die. In the second story Widow Bolte, who is still crying, decides she might as well roast the hens. The boys take fishing rods, climb onto the roof and pull the frying chickens up with their rods. Widow Bolte finds the chickens gone, thinks her little dog has eaten them, and gives the poor dog a beating. In the third story they take a saw and make a hole in the tiny wooden bridge outside the tailor’s house. They shout at the tailor, calling him names. He is furious and comes running out, the bridge breaks and he falls into the stream. Two flying geese save him. He has a terrible tummy ache but his wife puts a hot iron on his tummy and he feels better. In the fourth story the boys put gunpowder in the pipe of the schoolmaster while he is in church. When he lights his pipe there is an explosion. In the fifth story the boys collect beetles and put them under the mattress in their uncle’s bed. In the middle of the night, when the uncle is asleep, the beetles creep up on him. He wakes up and fights with them until he has killed them all. In the sixth story the boys try to steal some pretzels (German rolls) from the bakery, but they fall into the tub of dough. The baker comes in and finds them. He bakes them in the oven, but when they are taken out they eat their way through the dough and escape. In the seventh story the boys cut a hole in the farmer’s sacks. When the miller picks one of these sacks up he realizes the grain is spilling. He sees the boys, puts them in the sack and takes them to the mill, where the miller grinds them into corn and feeds them to his ducks. = = = Abstinence = = = Abstinence is a voluntary restraint from following a desire or appetite for certain bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving pleasure. Most frequently, the term refers to abstention from sexual intercourse, alcohol or food. Abstinence can be due to personal preferences, religious practices of practical considerations. In medicine abstinence also refers to discontinuation of an addictive drug. This may lead to intense craving for the drug or withdrawal syndromes. Abstinence from smoking is also recommended for those intending to undergo surgery. Abstinence may be a temporary or short-term goal meant for short durations of time. This includes refraining from compulsive eating or from compulsive drinking. The time and the measure is voluntary and is thus meant to enhance life. This is different from psychological mechanism of repression where the abstinence is not willingly adopted. In India, Buddhists, Jains, and some Hindus abstain from eating meat on the grounds both of health and of reverence for all sentient forms of life. Total abstinence from feeding on the flesh of cows is a hallmark of Hinduism. Abstinence In Religion. Fasting, abstinence from food or drink or both for health, ritualistic, religious, or ethical purposes. The abstention may be complete or partial, lengthy, of short duration, or intermittent. For Jewish people the principal day of fast is Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. Those who follows Islam the period of fasting lasts during the whole month of Ramadan. Each day of the month of Ramadan, people of the faith, fast without anything to eat or drink from dawn to dusk. Hindus fast on several festivals sometimes going without food or water and sometimes living only on fruits and dairy products. Followers of Hinduism also observe certain days when they may abstain completely from eating meat, eggs or fish. This is called vegetarianism. Some faiths like Buddhism and Jainism may advocate complete vegetarianism. Catholics and Orthodox Christians abstain from food and drink for an hour prior to taking Holy Communion, and abstain from meat on Ash Wednesday and during Lent. Mormons abstain from certain foods and drinks by combining spiritual discipline. Mormons also fast one day a month and the money saved by skipping meals is donated to the needy. Both Jews and Muslims abstain from pork in their regular diet. Hindus abstain from beef in their diet. = = = Sexual abstinence = = = Sexual abstinence is the practice of not having sex. It is a choice that some people make. As well as sex itself, they may also choose to abstain from other sexual activities. Sexual abstinence has been debated since ancient history, both in terms of same-sex and opposite-sex relationships. Some people take anaphrodisiacs to help them stay abstinent. Someone who decides to avoid sex is called a celibate or volcel. Culture. Abstaining from sex before marriage can be called chastity. In some countries, it is illegal to have sex before marriage. Many religious and ethical systems forbid sexual activities between a person and anyone other than a spouse. These include most denominational variations of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Other legal systems and societal norms can promote abstinence. People who are abstinent even though they do not want to be are sometimes called incels or TFL (true forced loneliness). One form of sexual abstinence is fapstinence, avoiding masturbation. Reasons. People may choose to practice abstinence for other reasons. A common reason is because of the person's religious or philosophical beliefs. When done for religious reasons, it is called celibacy. Other people may choose abstinence in order to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. When someone is abstinent from sex but they don't want to be, its sometimes called "incel", short for "involuntary celibacy". = = = Council of Jerusalem = = = The Council of Jerusalem or apostolic council is a common name for a meeting of early Christian leaders reported in the "Acts of the Apostles" chapter . The meeting must have happened about the year 50, at the latest some time before the death of James the Just in 62. The issues. A common interpretation is that the council came together because there was disagreement within the Early Christian community between those who believed the church must observe the rules of traditional Judaism, and Paul of Tarsus, who believed there was no such necessity. The "rules of traditional Judaism," the Halakha of Rabbinic Judaism, were not finished at this time. The central issue was circumcision, as the author of "Acts" relates the initial confrontation in Antioch, where Paul had been preaching: = = = Ironing = = = Ironing means getting the creases out of clothes after they have been washed and dried. Ironing is done with a tool called an "iron". It is called an iron because in past centuries it was made of iron, a type of metal. The iron is heated before it is used. This used to be done by putting the iron on a fire. Nowadays electricity is used to warm the iron. The user can put water inside, which becomes steam. Ironing clothes is usually easiest when the clothes are still very slightly damp, but it depends on the material of the clothes. There is normally a label on the clothes which shows whether it can be ironed, and at what temperature. Ironing is usually done with a padded ironing board. The clothes to be ironed are put on the ironing board and the iron is pushed carefully along the cloth to get all the wrinkles out. = = = Central European Time = = = Central European Time is a time zone. It is one hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (what used to be called Greenwich Mean Time). Most countries in the central part of Europe and some countries in Africa follow it. In Europe, the countries of Ireland, Great Britain, Iceland and Portugal use Western European Time. All the other countries, up to Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and North Macedonia use Central European Time. Algeria and Tunisia in Africa use CET but do not observe daylight saving time. = = = Central European Summer Time = = = Central European Summer Time (sometimes called Central European Daylight Time) is the name for a time zone. It is a daylight saving time. Some of the countries that have Central European Time shift their clocks forward one hour, during the summer months and shift it one hour backwards during winter months. A research station called Troll in Antarctica uses this time zone in the winter, but uses Greenwich Mean Time in the summer. The part of Europe using this time zone has had many changes from Central European Summer Time. It is because the Sun is not matching with the time in their areas. They have also stopped using the timezone multiple times. = = = James the Just = = = James the Just, also called James Adelphotheos, James, 1st Bishop of Jerusalem, or James, the Brother of the Lord and often identified with James the less (James, son of Alphaeus), who died in AD 62, was an important figure in Early Christianity. According to tradition, he was the first formal leader or bishop of Jerusalem, the author of the James in the New Testament, and the first of the Seventy of Luke 10:1-20. Paul of Tarsus in Galatians 2:9 (KJV) characterized James as such: "... James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars..." He is described in the New Testament as a "brother of Jesus" and in the Liturgy of St James as "the brother of God" ("Adelphotheos") Name. James was called "the Just" because of his ascetic practices, which involved taking Nazarite vows. The name also helps distinguish him from other important figures in early Christianity, such as James, son of Zebedee. He is sometimes called "James Adelphotheos", (literally "James the Brother of God" - Greek : I������ � ���������� ), based on New Testament descriptions. James' name was important in the genealogy of Jesus because he always appears first when someone lists Jesus' brothers and sisters, this means that James was the eldest brother of Jesus. Life. The canonical writings of the New Testament, as well as other written sources from the early church, provide some insights into Saint James' life and his role in the early church. The Synoptics mention his name, but nothing else about him, whereas the Gospel of John and early chapters of the Acts of the Apostles do not even mention James. "Acts of the Apostles", in later chapters, provides evidence that James was an important figure in the Christian community of Jerusalem. When Peter, having miraculously escaped from prison, must flee Jerusalem, he asks that James be informed (12:17). When the Christians of Antioch are concerned over whether Gentile Christians need be circumcised to be saved, and they send Paul and Barnabas to confer with the Jerusalem church there, James played a prominent role in the formulation of the council's decision (15:13ff). Indeed, after Peter and Paul have made their case, it is James who finally delivers what he calls his "judgement"—the original sense is close to "my ruling"—and afterwards, all accept it. James, in other words, is shown in charge of the Jerusalem group, which conflicts with later claims of Peter's primacy there. And when Paul arrives in Jerusalem to deliver the money he raised for the faithful there, it is to James that he speaks, and who insists that Paul ritually cleanse himself at Herod's Temple to prove his faith and deny rumors of teaching rebellion against the Torah (21:18ff) (a charge of antinomianism). Paul further describes James as being one of the persons the risen Christ showed himself to (1 Corinthians 15:3-8); then later in 1 Corinthians, mentions James in a way that suggests James had been married (9:5); and in Galatians, Paul lists James with Cephas (better known as Peter) and John, as the three "pillars" of the Church, and who will minister to the "circumcised" (in general Jews and Jewish Proselytes) in Jerusalem, while Paul and his fellows will minister to the "uncircumcised" (in general Gentiles). (2:9, 2:12). These terms (circumcised/uncircumcised) are generally interpreted to mean Jews and Greeks, who were predominant, however it is an oversimplification as 1st century Iudaea Province also had some Jews who no longer circumcised, and some Greeks (called Proselytes or Judaizers) and others such as Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Arabs who did. = = = Disciple (Christianity) = = = In Christianity, the disciples were the students of Jesus during his ministry, which sometimes means only the Twelve Apostles, but the gospels speaks of different numbers of disciples. In the Book of Acts, the Apostles themselves have disciples. The word "disciple" is used today as a way of self-identification for those who seek to learn from Christianity. The term disciple comes from the Ancient Greek language word coming to English by way of the Latin "discipulus". "Disciple" should not be confused with "apostle", meaning "" While a disciple is one who learns from a teacher, a student, an apostle is sent to deliver those teachings to others. Disciples of Jesus of Nazareth. The four. Both the gospels of Mark () and Matthew () include passages where Jesus initially calls four fishermen from among those at the Sea of Galilee. These are Simon (later called "Rock" or Peter) and his brother Andrew, and the brothers James and John (later called the "Sons of Thunder" or Boanerges). A very similar report in the Gospel of Luke does not speak of Andrew. also includes an initial calling of disciples, but these are: an unnamed disciple, Andrew, Simon, Philip and Nathanael. Since the Gospel of Luke does not include Andrew, and through various passages in the four gospels where Simon Peter, James and John are called to meet with Jesus separately from the twelve, they are commonly termed "the three." The usage of "the four" over "the three" is still a point which some Christians debate, but never as an essential doctrinal point. The twelve. Most of the attention in the gospels is given to a specific group of disciples called by Jesus on the top of a mountain and commissioned by him as the Twelve Apostles. These men are: The Gospel of John refers to one disciple as the one whom Jesus loved. Since the apostle John, unlike the other twelve, is never named in that gospel, the "beloved disciple" is assumed to be him. Great crowd and the seventy. The number of or persons among Jesus' disciples is not always given in the gospel accounts. A much larger group of people is identified as disciples in the opening of the passage of the Sermon on the Plain that begins in Luke . Additionally, seventy (or seventy-two, depending on the source used) people are sent out in pairs to prepare the way for Jesus (Luke 10). They are sometimes referred to as "the Seventy" or "the Seventy Disciples". They are to eat any food offered, heal the sick and spread the word; that God's reign is coming, that whoever hears them hears Jesus, whoever rejects them rejects Jesus and whoever rejects Jesus rejects the One who sent him. In addition they are granted great powers over the enemy and their names are written in heaven. Road to Emmaus. Cleopas is one of the two disciples to whom the risen Lord appeared at Emmaus (Luke 24:18). Cleopas, with an unnamed disciple of Jesus' are walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day of Jesus' resurrection. Cleopas and his friend were discussing the events of the past few days when a stranger asked them what they spoke of. The stranger asked to join Cleopas and his friend for the evening meal. There the stranger revealed himself, after blessing and breaking the bread, as the resurrected Jesus and then disappeared. Cleopas and his friend hastened to Jerusalem to carry the news to the other disciples, where Jesus subsequently appeared to them as well. The incident is without parallel in Matthew, Mark, or John. Women. In Luke (10:38–42), Mary, sister of Lazarus is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was "cumbered about many things" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen "the better part," that of listening to the master's discourse. John names her as the "one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair" (11:2). In Luke, an unidentified "sinner" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet. Any pre-existing relationship between Jesus and Lazarus himself, prior to the miracle, is unspecified by John. In Catholic folklore, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, is seen as the same as Mary Madgalene. Luke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve. From among them he names three women: "Mary, called Magdalene, ... and Joanna the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources" (Luke 8:2-3). Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the "two men in dazzling clothes". Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve. More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers. There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her. Other gospel writers differ as to which women witness the crucifixion and witness to the resurrection. Mark includes Mary, the mother of James and Salome (not to be confused with Salomé the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb. John includes Mary the wife of Clopas at the crucifixion. = = = Ahmed Jibril = = = Ahmed Jibril (1938 – July 7, 2021) was the founder and co-leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC). He founded it in 1968. His son Jihad Ahmed Jibril was to take over, but was killed by a car bomb in Beirut in 2002. = = = Jihad Ahmed Jibril = = = Mohammed Jihad Ahmed Jibril (March 3, 1961 in Damascus - May 20, 2002 in Beirut) was the son of Ahmed Jibril, founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC). He was killed by a car bomb. He was assassinated on May 20, 2002. Jihad Ahmed Jibril was the leader of the military wing of the PFLP-GC and was the heir apparent of the organization before he was killed in a car bombing in Beirut in 2002. The assassination was blamed on Israel, although Jibril had many other enemies, including the Lebanese Christian militia and other Palestinian nationalist organizations. Ahmed Jibril was co-leader of the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Israeli radio reports said that the son, Jihad Ahmed Jibril, was involved in smuggling arms and explosives to the ground very much, which made the brakes less useful. In 1968, Boeing improved the thrust reverser. This improvement was put onto all aircraft after March 1969. Aircraft which were made before the improvement could have it installed. Boeing also improved the flaps. This improvement allowed the flaps to be used more during takeoffs and landing. All these changes meant that the 737 could hold more cargo and fly further. In May 1971, after the 135th aircraft was built, all of these improvements, as well as better engines and more fuel, were put into the 737-200. This gave it 15% more payload and range than the first 737-200s. This type of 737-200 became known as the 737-200 Advanced. In 1970, Boeing only got 37 orders for 737s. Since Boeing were running out of money, they thought about stopping making 737s and selling the design to Japanese companies. Boeing cancelled the Boeing Supersonic Transport and started making less Boeing 747s. By doing this, Boeing kept enough money to keep the 737 project going. In 1988, Boeing stopped making 737-200s. 1,114 aircraft were made and the last one was delivered to Xiamen Airlines on August 8, 1988. 737 Classic. In 1979, Boeing started working on a large improvement for the 737. Boeing wanted to allow the aircraft to hold more passengers and travel further. It also wanted to make improvements to make the aircraft more modern. However, it also wanted to keep it similar to the older 737s. In 1980, information on this new type of 737 (called the 737-300) was given at the Farnborough Airshow. The CFM56-3B-1 engine was chosen to be the engine for this new 737 type. This engine burned much less fuel and was much less noisy. However, it was also difficult to fit these engines to the aircraft. This was because the 737's wings were not very high above the ground, and the CFM56 had a bigger diameter than the original engines. Boeing and CFM solved the problem by putting the engine slightly ahead of the wing, instead of right under it. They also moved some parts of the engine, which would normally go on the bottom, to the sides. This made the engine look a bit like a hamster pouch, because the engine is not shaped like a circle. The plane could now carry 149 passengers, because the fuselage of the plane was made bigger. Many changes were made to the wings. The tip of the wing was made longer by . The wingspan was also made bigger. The flaps on the wings were changed. The flight deck (cockpit) was improved with electronic displays. However, airlines could choose not to have these in their planes. The main cabin (where the passengers sit) was also made better. It looked similar to the cabin of a Boeing 757. The prototype of the 737-300 first flew on 24 February 1984. Its pilot was Jim McRoberts. In June 1986, Boeing said that it was working on the 737-400. The 737-400 made the fuselage even bigger (by ). This change meant that the -400 could carry 170 passengers. The 737-400's first flight was on February 19, 1988. The first airline to use it was Piedmont Airlines. Boeing made a 737-500 because its customers wanted one. It was a replacement of the 737-200. The -500 is longer than the 737-200. Up to 132 passengers can travel on the 737-500. Cockpits with electronic displays could be installed on the -500, but airlines could choose the use the older cockpit if they wanted. The 737-500 was first ordered by Southwest Airlines in 1987. Southwest Airlines ordered 20 aircraft. The 737-500 flew for the first time on June 30, 1989. On February 28, 1990, Southwest Airlines got their first delivery. After the Boeing 737 Next Generation planes were brought into service, Boeing named the 737-300/-400/-500s the 737 Classic series. 737 Next Generation. In 1991, Boeing started working on an updated group of 737s. They did this so they could have a plane to rival the Airbus A320. Boeing said that the 737 Next Generation (NG) program had begun on November 17, 1991. The -600, -700, -800, and -900 models are all part of the 737 Next Generation program. The 737 was changed so much by the 737NG program that it is almost like a new aircraft. However, some important parts of the plane were kept similar to the older 737s. The wing was changed again. Many different changes were made. An example of one is a bigger wingspan (made bigger by ). Since the wings were made bigger, 30% more fuel could fit in the plane. CFM56-7B engines were used, which were newer, quieter and burned less fuel. The improvements to the wing, engine and fuel mean that the 737NG can travel 900 nautical miles further. This means it can travel over in total, which means that the 737NG can travel between different continents. Winglets can be added to most 737NG models. The flight deck was given modern electronics (called avionics). The main cabin was also improved. The first NG to be built was a 737-700. It was finished on December 8, 1995. This aircraft was 2,843rd 737 built. It first flew on February 9, 1997. The prototype 737-800 was finished on June 30, 1997 and first flew on July 31, 1997. The smallest of the 737NGs, the -600, is the same size as the -500. It was the last NG to be launched (it was launched in December 1997). It first flew on January 22, 1998. The FAA certified it on August 18, 1998. A Boeing delivered the 5,000th 737 to Southwest Airlines on February 13, 2006. The 6,000th 737 was delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in April 2009. The Airbus A320 family has sold more planes than the 737NG over the past ten years. However, this total includes sales for the A321 and A318. The A321 has been the rival of Boeing's 757 and the A318 has been the rival of the 717. The Next Generation series helped make sure the 737 stayed the bestselling airliner family since it first flew. 737 MAX. Since 2006, Boeing has been thinking about replacing the 737 with a completely new design. This was named the Boeing Y1 by people who worked at Boeing. This re-design would be launched after the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Boeing did not decide on whether or not to go ahead with this. They said they would decide in 2011. On July 20, 2011, Boeing said that they were working on a new 737 version, which would have the CFM International LEAP engine. American Airlines said they would order 100 of these aircraft. On August 30, 2011, Boeing said that a new 737 would definitely be launched. It was called the 737 MAX. It would also definitely have CFM International LEAP-1B engines. The MAX 8 first carried paying passengers in May, 2017. In 2019 two MAX 8 aircraft crashed, killing all aboard and causing aviation authorities to ban commercial operation of the 737 MAX until they are fixed. Design. The 737's main landing gear (wheels) go into holes at the bottom of the plane. The wheels do not have a door to close over them. The tires can be seen easily when a 737 is taking off or is flying low-down. 737s do not have fuel dump systems. A fuel dump system is a system which gets rid of any unneeded fuel if the aircraft needs to make an emergency landing while it still has a lot of fuel on board. This is useful because aircraft can only land safely at a certain weight or below. Getting rid of unneeded fuel helps to get to a safe weight for the plane to land. The first 737s were too small to need these systems. Adding a fuel dump system to the bigger 737s would make the plane much heavier. Instead, if the emergency is not very serious, 737s fly around in circles to get rid of fuel. If the emergency is serious, the 737 just needs to land at an unsafe weight. If it has to land at an unsafe weight, the plane needs to be looked at for damage. If there is no damage, the plane can be put back into service. Engines. Engines on the 737 Classic series (300, 400, 500) and Next Generation series (600, 700, 800, 900) are not shaped like a circle like most planes. The 737 Classics had CFM56 turbofan engines. These burned much less fuel and made much less noise than the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D engines which were used on the -100 and -200. However, because the 737's wings and fuselage are not very high above the ground, it was impossible to get the engines to fit on the wings. Boeing and CFM fixed this problem by putting the engines slightly ahead of the wings instead of putting them right underneath. They also moved some parts of the engines which would normally go at the bottom to the sides. This is what makes the engines non-circular. The gearbox of the engine was moved from the bottom of the engine to the side. The gearbox makes the engine look a bit like a triangle. Since the engine is close to the ground, it is possible that they can be damaged by things lying on the ground. The CFM56-7 engine on the 737 Next Generation burns even less fuel than the engines on the 737 Classics. The Boeing 737 MAX aircraft will have CFM International LEAP-1B engines. These engines are supposed to burn 10-12% less fuel than the CFM56-7B engines on the 737 Next Generation family. Flight systems. The 737's controls are very safe. If the hydraulics or both engines fail, servo tabs will be automatically used. Servo tabs are small hinges which move important parts of an aircraft. The tabs are controlled by the yoke (the thing used to steer the plane). For the 737 Next Generation, a new cockpit with LCD displays was made. These cockpits also have modern avionics (autopilot etc.). Most 737 cockpits have "eyebrow windows". These are smaller windows which are above the main windows. There are two on each side. Eyebrow windows were used on the Boeing 707. They helped the pilot see better when the plane was turning. However, because autopilot, advanced radar etc. exist, they are no longer needed. They were removed from the 737 cockpit in 2004. However, 737s used by the military still have them installed. If the customer likes, Boeing will install eyebrow windows for them. Upgrades. Winglets can be fitted to 737s which do not have them already installed. They can also be added when the aircraft is built. The winglets are about tall. They are fitted at the end of the wing and help the engines to burn less fuel because they reduce drag. They also help make less noise on takeoff. Winglets can help a plane burn up to 5% less fuel. the 737 has carbon brakes. These are made by Messier-Bugatti. These new brakes have been allowed by the Federal Aviation Administration. They weigh less than the steel brakes normally fitted to the 737 Next Generation family. If 700 pounds of weight is taken off a Boeing 737-800, it burns 0.5% less fuel. Main cabin. How the cabin looks was changed in each different type of 737 (Classic and Next Generation). The cabin design of the 737 Original was changed 737 Classic using designs from the 757. Designs from the Boeing 777 were used to design the cabin for the Next Generation 737. The newest cabin design is called the Sky Interior. It has curved walls. It also has redesigned windows. The Sky Interior has more headroom and LED mood lighting. Overhead bins which move have been installed. These bins are similar to the bins on a 777 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner. They have more space for luggage than the other designs. The Sky Interior is also designed to make the cabin less noisy by 2–4 dB. The first 737 with the Sky Interior was delivered to Flydubai in 2010. Malaysia Airlines, TUIFly and Continental Airlines have also ordered 737s with the Sky Interior. Types of 737s. The 737 are split into three "generations". These are Original, Classic and Next Generation. The "Original" models are the 737-100, 737-200/-200 Advanced. The "Classic" models are the 737-300, 737-400 and 737-500. The "Next Generation" models are the 737-600, 737-700/-700ER, 737-800, and 737-900/-900ER. The fourth generation of 737 is called the 737 MAX. It is still being worked on, but when it is finished, it will be made up of the 737-MAX-7, 737-MAX-8 and 737-MAX-9. The MAX-7 will replace the 737-700, the MAX-8 will replace the 737-800 and the MAX-9 will replace the 737-900 and 739-900ER. 737 Original. 737-100. The very first 737 model was the 737-100. It was first ordered by Lufthansa in 1965. The -100 was finished on January 17, 1967. It entered service in 1968. The aircraft is the smallest type of 737. Only 30 737-100s were ordered and delivered. No 737-100s are still being used by airlines. The 737-100 prototype is in the Museum of Flight in Seattle. 737-200. The 737-200 is a 737-100 with a larger fuselage. It was created because of an order from United Airlines in 1965. The -200 was finished on June 29, 1967. It entered service in 1968. The 737-200 Advanced is an improved version of the -200. Its first user was All Nippon Airways. It began using the -200 Advanced on May 20, 1971. The -200 Advanced has many improvements. For example, more powerful engines and more fuel. The 737-200 Advanced can also fly further than the 737-200. The last delivery of a 737-200 aircraft was in August 1988 to Xiamen Airlines. This was the 1,095th 737-200 built. Many 737-200s are still used by airlines. After 40 years the last 737-200 aircraft in the United States were retired on March 31, 2008. This happened with the last flights of Aloha Airlines. 737 Classic. The Boeing 737 Classic is the name of the 737-300/-400/-500. However, they were only called the 737 Classics after the 737 Next Generation (737-600/700/800/900) aircraft were made. Until then, the 737 Classics were called the 'new generation' of the 737. The 737 Classics were made from 1984 to 2000. 1,988 aircraft were delivered in that time. As of January 1, 2001, 1,945 are in service. 737-300. The 737-300 was brought into service in 1981. It was used by both US Airways and Southwest Airlines. The 737-300 is the first model of the 737 Classic series. The -300 can usually hold 128 passengers. The 737-300 series was made until 1999. The last -300 was delivered to Air New Zealand on 17 December 1999. This was the 1,113th 737-300 made. 737-400. The 737-400 brought into service in 1985. It was just a longer version of the 737-300. Piedmont Airlines was the launch customer. They ordered 25 aircraft in 1986. The first 737-400s were brought into service in 1988 with Piedmont. The last -400 was delivered to CSA Czech Airlines. This was the 486th -400 built. The 737-400F was a 737-400 changed into a cargo plane. The -400F was not delivered by Boeing. They were changed into cargo planes by the airlines that owned them. Alaska Airlines was the first airline to change a -400 to a -400F. It could carry 10 pallets of cargo. 737-500. The 737-500 was finished 1987. It was brought into service with Southwest Airlines in 1990. The 737-500 is around the same length of the 737-200. It was a modern, complete replacement of the 737-200. The last 737-500 was delivered to All Nippon Airways on July 26, 1999. This was the 389th built. 737 Next Generation. In the 1990s, Boeing realized that the Airbus A320 family was a serious threat. Boeing could lose customers because of it. In November 1991, Boeing began the Next Generation program. The Next Generation aircraft would replace the 737 Classics. The 737-600, 737-700 and 737-800 planes were planned. 737-600. The 737-600 replaced the 737-500. It was also supposed to replace the McDonnell Douglas DC-9. The 737-600 was finished in 1995. The first aircraft was delivered to Scandinavian Airlines on September 18, 1998. The 737-600 is the only Boeing 737 still being made that cannot be fitted with winglets. The 737-600's rivals are the Airbus A318, Embraer 195 and Sukhoi Superjet 100. The Bombardier CSeries will also be a rival.&lt;ref&gt;"Bombardier Launches CSeries Jet." = = = Tsar = = = Tsar is a title for the supreme ruler in several countries. In Bulgaria, the title was used in 913–1422 and again in 1908–1946. The last tsar to rule Bulgaria was Boris III, who replaced Ferdinand I of Bulgaria 1918. In Serbia, the title was used in 1346—1371. The last tsar to rule Serbia was Stephen Uroš V. In the Russian Empire, the title was used from 1546 until 1721. Starting in 1721, the title of Russian emperors was "imperator", but the word "tsar" remained in common use until the Russian Revolution in 1917. The last tsar to rule Russia was Nicholas II, who replaced Alexander III in 1894. The system of government used during the Tsardom of Russia and the Russian Empire was called Tsarist autocracy, also known as Tsarism. "Tsar" is also spelled "tzar", "czar", and "csar". It is the Eastern European word for "caesar". It can be translated to "emperor". = = = 1550s = = = The 1550s was a decade that started on 1 January 1550 and ended on 31 December 1559. = = = 1840 = = = 1840 was a leap year. = = = Engelbert Dollfuss = = = Engelbert Dollfuss ("German": Dollfuß) (October 4, 1892 – July 25, 1934) was the Chancellor of Austria from 1932 until 1933. He led the country as a dictator from early 1933 until 1934. He studied law in Vienna, and Economics in Berlin. During World War I, he served in the Alps and briefly became a Prisoner of War in 1918. He became Chancellor on May 20, 1932 as head of a right-wing coalition government. He wanted to solve the problems caused by the Depression. He had problems finding majorities in parliament. The measures he liked to take to deal with inflation were not well liked. In March 1933, he suspended the Austrian parliament. He then governed by decree. With Adolf Hitler as Chancellor in Germany, Dollfuss feared that the influence of the NSDAP would grow. This would then lead to a growth in popularity for its Austrian counterpart. Because of this, he banned the NSDAP in June 1933. He also banned the SDAPÖ in February 1934. In September 1933 he formed an umbrella grouping to support the regime, the "Vaterländische Front" (Fatherland Front) and merged the Christian Social Party with the para-military Heimwehr (Home Guard), a Nationalist paramilitary group. The regime which was put into power by him and remained in power until 1938 is often called "Austrofascism". The form of state he employed was called the "Ständestaat". On July 25, 1934, eight Austrian Nazis entered the Chancellery building and shot and killed Dollfuss in an attempted coup, as a prelude to Anschluss. The Nazis surrendered and were executed. Kurt Schuschnigg became the new dictator of Austria. = = = Language isolate = = = A language isolate is a language that is not known to be related to any other language. Many languages are related to other languages by coming from an older language, and both are still similar. Languages that are related are language families. Most languages are known to belong to a language family. However, some are not known to be related to other languages and are called language isolates. Some spoken language isolates are Basque, Zuni, Burushaski, Ainu and Mapudungun. Some extinct language isolates are Sumerian, Elamite and Urartian. = = = Species = = = A species is a kind of organism. It is a basic unit of biological classification, and a formal rank in taxonomy. Originally, the word was used informally in a rather vague way, but now there are at least 26 different ways it is used. All animals or plants that are the same kind belong to the same species. Wolves ("Canis lupus") are one species. Humans ("Homo sapiens") are another species. Broadly, the idea is that, for example, cats breed with cats and produce more cats. This is the basis for deciding to have a species called "Felis catus". However, to give a simple definition of 'species' is difficult, and many people have tried. Species is a word for a particular kind of living thing, for example, a jackdaw. Jackdaws and ravens are similar, so they are together in a larger group (taxon) called a genus, in this case "Corvus". Then there is a family (such as the crow family, which includes crows and ravens as well as jays and magpies). Families are put together into orders such as the songbirds, which includes many families of birds. The next group is the class; all birds are in the same class. After that is the phylum, such as vertebrates, which is all animals with backbones. Last of all is the kingdom, like the animal kingdom. These are ways to classify living things. There is a mnemonic to help people remember the order of the divisions which are listed again below: "King Phillip Came Over For Great Spaghetti". Example. Take as an example the bird called a Common Loon or Great Northern Diver: Historical changes in the term. There is a long history of disagreement over whether species are objective things, or whether they are man-made labels. Those who think species are objectively different point to things which 'good' species do. They look similar, and they breed true, that is, mate with their own kind, and have offspring which are obviously in the same species. Against this are the many exceptions. There are species which shade gradually into other species, and which interbreed in overlapping populations (see ring species). On the other hand, there are species which look absolutely identical, but which do not breed together (sibling species). It is quite clear that 'species' as used by palaeontologists and 'species' as used by other biologists cannot be the same. A palaeontologist can only use visible features of a fossil, which are only a small part of the traits of a living species. Not only that, but many species which are virtually identical can only be distinguished by their DNA. This relatively recent discovery of sibling species is very important, and their numbers are growing rapidly. We underestimated the effect of convergent evolution. The greatest change in the species concept was made by Charles Darwin, for evolution meant that hard-and-fast lines could not be drawn between species. Another shift came when Ernst Mayr proposed the biological species concept, which emphasized the interbreeding population as the heart of the species concept. This meant that, in his view, species were objective, that is not just the subjective opinion of a taxonomist. His explanation of the process of speciation was geographical isolation between populations which had once been interbreeding. Today, emphasis has moved back closer to Darwin's ideas. Numbers. According to the most recent estimate, there are about 8.7 million species on Earth. This counts only eukaryote organisms. It leaves out bacteria, archaea and viruses. Fewer than a quarter of the species have not been identified, named and catalogued. At the present rate, it might take over 1000 years to complete this job. Some will become extinct before this count is complete. = = = Ancestor = = = An ancestor is a person (or another organism or thing) from whom (or which) another is descended. Usually, it refers to a person far in the past, rather than the parents or grandparents in the close family. A very similar word is forebear. A female ancestor may be called an ancestress. The line of ancestors from which an organism descends is referred to as its ancestry. A second meaning relates to evolution. There, it is used of a species or group of species of animals or plants from which others have evolved. In a similar way, the word ancestor can be used for an early prototype or forerunner of a later device. In law an ancestor can mean the person from whom an estate is lawfully obtained. No blood relationship is necessarily implied. More commonly, however, it is the person from whom an estate is obtained based on law and blood. Two people have a genetic relationship if one is the ancestor of the other, or if they share a common ancestor. Each of someone's ancestors will have contributed to their DNA. In evolution, species that have evolved from the same ancestor are said to be of common descent. However, this concept of ancestry does not apply to some bacteria and other organisms capable of horizontal gene transfer. DNA testing is used in determining ancestry. This can be for testing, to determine the parents of a child for legal purposes. DNA is also used to better understand the ancestry and history of all humans over the last 50,000 years. This was one of the benefits of the Human genome project. In some cultures ancestors may have relatively little importance. Many today have no knowledge of their own great-great-grandparents. China is an example of a culture that in general has a deep respect for ancestors. Korea is an example of a culture that engages in ancestor worship where ancestors are revered. But genealogy (the study of one's ancestors) is growing in popularity and includes both amateur and professional genealogists. = = = River dolphin = = = River dolphins are five species of dolphin which live in fresh water rivers and estuaries. Three species live in fresh water rivers. The La Plata Dolphin lives in salt water estuaries and the ocean. Differences between marine and river dolphins. Both river dolphins and marine dolphins belong to a group of mammals called cetaceans. The snout of a river dolphin measures about 58 centimeters (2 ft) long, approximately four times as long as that of most marine dolphins. They use their long snout to search for fish on the muddy bottom of the river. River dolphins have smaller eyes than marine dolphins, and their vision is poorly developed because they live in dark, muddy water. River dolphins are less active than marine dolphins because they do not need to search so widely to find fish. Marine dolphins work in pods (packs) because when they find a shoal of fish then they work together to make the most of their find. River dolphins work mostly as individuals or small groups. Taxonomy. The following is the taxonomy of river dolphins, or how dolphins are classified: Other sources. River-Dolphins-and-their-habitat = = = Estuary = = = An estuary is where a river meets the sea. There, saltwater mixes with freshwater. The river becomes wider and wider and flows slowly to the ocean. Bays, marshes, swamps, and inlets can all have estuaries. A view of an estuary from the air is usually an interesting sight: many estuaries meander (curve and bend) to find their way to the sea. Estuaries come in all sizes and shapes, each according to its location and climate. Where rivers meet the sea and fresh water mixes with salt water, the mixture is called brackish water. Some estuaries are very large. They may be large ocean bays that have more than one river flowing into them. For example, Chesapeake Bay is a large estuary, and several different rivers meet the Atlantic Ocean there. In simple terms it is where a river meets with a large body of water only with ((one)) outlet and not many like a ((delta)). Habitat. Estuaries are usually filled with shallow waters, and sunlight reaches all levels of the water. Marsh grasses, algae, and other kinds of plants live in estuaries and provide food for a variety of fish, crabs, oysters, and shrimp. Estuaries are especially important since they act as nurseries for many different types of young fish and other animals before they head out toward the open ocean. Many sea birds also nest in estuaries. The United States government has a program to study and protect the natural environment in many different estuaries, called the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. One reason that the natural environment in so many estuaries is in danger is because they are also good places for people to live and build cities. Unfortunately, many of world's largest cities are at or near estuaries. = = = James Bond = = = James Bond is a fictional British spy created by Ian Fleming in 1953. History. 1950s-1960s. In 1953, Fleming wrote "Casino Royale", the very first James Bond novel. The novel made a lot of money, and he continued to write one James Bond novel each year until he died in 1964. In a 1956 South African radio program "Moonraker" he was voiced by Bob Holness. In 1962 Albert. R. "Cubby" Broccoli and Harry Saltzman started to produce the first James Bond movie, Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as James Bond. The movie became extremely popular, and they continued to make more Bond movies. In the end of the 1960s Connery did not want to do any more Bond movies, and many thought that Bond was now dead. In 1969, George Lazenby appeared in one movie as the Bond character, but the movie was not successful. 1970s-1980s. In 1971 Sean Connery stepped back into the role for one movie "Diamonds are Forever". After this in 1973, producers came up with the "Live and Let Die" movie, starring Roger Moore as Bond. The movie became a very big success. The series continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s with Roger Moore playing the role of Bond. In the 1980s, Bond movies were not as successful at the box office. Unlike the 1960s and 1970s, in the 1980s there were many other action movies being produced that could compete with the Bond series. After Moore left the role as Bond, he was replaced with Timothy Dalton in the late 1980s. Dalton tried to make a serious, "down to earth" Bond, closer to the Fleming novels. Fans did not like Dalton's interpretation of the Bond character, and the movies made little money. 1990s. The Cold War ended in 1991. Since Bond almost always fought Communists, many now thought that the Bond series of movies was finally dead. In 1995, producers developed the GoldenEye movie, starring Pierce Brosnan as Bond. This film made the Bond character well known in the 1990s. Brosnan appeared in several Bond movies. 2000s. In 2002, the James Bond character was used in the 20th movie, Die Another Day, the 40th anniversary of the movies and the 50th anniversary since Fleming wrote his first Bond novel. In 2006, the 21st movie, Casino Royale, was released. Pierce Brosnan, who played James Bond in the previous four movies, was replaced by Daniel Craig, the first James Bond to have blonde hair. The movie is based on the first Ian Fleming novel of the same name, but is set in the present day. The movie features a cameo appearance by Richard Branson, a British billionaire. It has a new model of Aston Martin DB9, the car that made James Bond so famous in the 1960s. Many fans think that whilst this movie is different than other movies, it is much better, and movies in the future (however few there will be) will be in this new format. In 2008, Craig appeared in a second Bond movie, "Quantum of Solace" and a third, "Skyfall", in 2012. His fourth appearance as Bond was with "Spectre" in 2016. His fifth and final appearance as Bond is with "No Time to Die" in 2021. Movies. Many of the James Bond movies were massive hits. However, there are two movies classed as unofficial Bond films and not recognised as part of the series. The 1967 version of "Casino Royale" was a spoof, featuring "Jimmy Bond". Also, "Never Say Never Again" was not made by Albert R. Broccoli's production company, EON Productions. Connery is the tallest actor to play James Bond to this day. Representation. Visually and musically, but also artistically overall, James Bond and the British way of being a gentleman repeatedly serve as inspiration, or artists like Marc Engelhard and other protagonists resemble each other in this style. = = = A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 movie) = = = A Streetcar Named Desire is a 1951 movie. It is based on the 1947 play by Tennessee Williams. The movie stars Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh. = = = Tetrahedron = = = A tetrahedron or triangular pyramid is a polyhedron (a three-dimensional shape). It has four corners and six edges. All four of its faces are equilateral triangles. Every two edges meet on one of those corners forming a sixty-degree angle. Formulas for a regular tetrahedron. A regular tetrahedron is a tetrahedron whose edges are the same length. If the length of an edge is "a": Other properties. A regular tetrahedron's faces are all the same, and so are all its edges, as well as its corners. This makes it a regular polyhedron. It is also convex (its faces do not go through one another), which makes it a Platonic solid. The dual of regular tetrahedron is another regular tetrahedron. This is called being self-dual. = = = Robert Hooke = = = Robert Hooke FRS (Isle of Wight, 18 July 1635 – London, 3 March 1703) was an English naturalist, architect and polymath. Hooke played an important role in the birth of science in the 17th century with both experimental and theoretical work. He was a colleague of Robert Boyle and Christopher Wren, and a rival to Isaac Newton. Hooke was a leader in the plans to rebuild after the Great Fire of London in 1666. There is no surviving portrait of Hooke. Hooke's achievements. Physics. He discovered Hooke's Law of elasticity. He designed and ordered the making of telescopes and microscopes, and used both instruments. He reported on this work in a book called "Micrographia" in 1665. He was the first person to see biological cells. He made drawings of bodies in the Solar System, and made the first attempts to measure the distance of certain stars. Robert Hooke was appointed the Royal Society's first Curator of Experiments in 1662, and he rose to be Secretary of the Royal Society. He took responsibility for experiments performed at its weekly meetings. This was a position he held for over 40 years. In 1664 Hooke also was appointed Professor of Geometry at Gresham College in London and Cutlerian Lecturer in Mechanics. On 8 July 1680, Hooke observed the nodal patterns associated with the mode of vibration of glass plates. He ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with flour, and saw the nodal patterns emerge.p101 Hooke did some fundamental work on gravitation and the motion of the planets. Forever after, he was convinced that Newton and the world had cheated him of the creditp389 Natural history. He was also known for his work in natural history (biology and geology). He reported on his microsope use in a book called "Micrographica" in 1665. He was the first person to see biological cells, and was the first to use the word 'cell' to describe them. In 1668, in a talk to the Royal Society, he recognised that fossil shells of unknown marine animals suggested that some species had become extinct. Architecture. Hooke achieved fame in his day as Surveyor to the City of London and chief assistant of Christopher Wren. Hooke helped Wren rebuild London after the Great Fire in 1666. He also worked on the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and the infamous Bethlem Royal Hospital (which became known as 'Bedlam'). Many other buildings were designed by Hooke, including the Royal College of Physicians (1679). Hooke's collaboration with Christopher Wren included St Paul's Cathedral, whose dome uses a method of construction conceived by Hooke. Hooke also participated in the design of the Pepys Library, which held the manuscripts of Samuel Pepys's diaries, the most frequently cited eyewitness account of the Great Fire of London. In the reconstruction after the Great Fire, Hooke proposed redesigning London's streets on a grid pattern with wide boulevards. This pattern was used in the later renovation of Paris, Liverpool, and many American cities. The proposal was rejected. The opponents argued that in practice property owners were secretly shifting their boundaries. Hooke was in demand to settle many of these disputes, due to his skill as a surveyor and his tact as an arbitrator. = = = Emission = = = Emission is a word that originally comes from Latin. Originally it means something that is sent out. Several things can be sent out: = = = Leo Tolstoy = = = Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy (9 September 1828 20 November 1910) was a Russian novelist and anarchist, famous for writing the books "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina", and many other works. He was a Christian and believed in non-violence and practiced simple living. His work "The Kingdom of God is within you" has influenced people like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Early life. Tolstoy was born at Yasnaya Polyana, the family estate in the region of Tula, Russia and he married Sofia Andreevna Bers. Death. Tolstoy died in 1910, at the age of 82. He died of pneumonia. Life and career. When he was young his parents died, so he and his siblings were brought up by relatives. At the age of 16, he began studying law and oriental languages. Unfortunately, he left University in the middle of his studies and spent much of his time in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Later on in his life, he joined the Army with his brother after running up some heavy gambling debts. It was at that time that he started writing. His conversion from a wealthy society author to the non-violent and spiritual anarchist of his later days was notable. It was caused by his experience in the army as well as two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860–61. Others who followed a similar path were Alexander Herzen, Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy saw a public execution in Paris, an experience which marked the rest of his life. After "Anna Karenina", Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as "The Death of Ivan Ilyich" (1886) and "What Is to Be Done?" (1886) develop a radical Christian philosophy which led to his excommunication from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1901. After shaping both his political and literary development in Europe, he returned to Russia and founded 13 schools for Russia's peasant children. = = = California wine = = = People have made wine in the American state of California for a long time. California has become recognized as making some of the world's best wine. California makes most of the wine that is made in America. History. People first made wine in California in 1769. Missionaries from Mexico brought their wine plants to produce wine for the mass. Later, people coming from Europe improved the making of wine. They had brought their own kinds of wine plants. Before 1920, there was more wine made every year. Then Prohibition began. During Prohibition, it was not allowed to sell alcoholic drinks in the United States. It almost ended the making of wine in California. Californian wine-making took a long time to recover. In 1990, the USA sent less than five percent of its wine to other countries. After that, exports of wine from California increased. Today, the USA is one of the big wine industries. Wines. Wine comes in different colors. Most wines are called "red" or "white". White wine is not really white, it just has a very light color. 54 percent of the Californian wines are white wines. Some examples of white wines are Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. Some examples of red wines are Zinfandel, Cabernet-Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir. Cool climate viticulture. Grapes for wine used to need warm weather. People wanted to grow more grapes, so they learned how to grow them where the weather was not as warm. That way of growing grapes is called "cool climate viticulture". Vines are now planted in colder places, up to above sea level. Monterey County was the first place where that was done. Wine regions. In California, there are more than 800 wine cellars. Wine cellars are big rooms were wine is stored. They are part of a winery, the place where wine is produced. Two of the most famous growing areas for wine in California are Napa County and Sonoma County. The wines from those places are some of the best in the world. Some examples of the wines made there are Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon. Other known wineries are in Mendocino, in the Lake Counties, Santa Maria and Santa Barbara. = = = Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid = = = Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a 1969 American movie from 20th Century Fox. George Roy Hill directed it, and John Foreman produced it. It stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as two robbers in Wyoming who go to Bolivia to escape the law. The movie was loosely based on the real story of the two title characters (Butch Cassidy and his friend Harry Longabaugh, also called "Sundance"). But it made the legends of the two more popular. It won four Academy Awards: for Best Cinematography (shooting work on a movie), Best Original Score, Best Song (Burt Bacharach's "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head") and Best Original Screenplay (William Goldman). It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director (Hill) and Best Sound. Goldman won the BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay. It was one of the largest-grossing movies of the 1960s (with $102.3 million in the United States). It was number fifty on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list. At first, Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen (even Marlon Brando) were called upon to play the title roles. When Newman and Redford took their place, the roles were switched, with Newman as Sundance, and Redford as Cassidy. The studio, 20th Century Fox, did not like Redford's role. But the movie's director, Hill, wanted it that way. As a result, Redford has said that the movie made him a more famous actor. The Sundance Film Festival is named after Redford's role, as well his Utah ski resort. = = = 1480s = = = The 1480s was a decade that began on 1 January 1480 and ended on 31 December 1489. = = = Mehmed II = = = Mehmed II (; , ; 30 March 14323 May 1481), commonly known as Mehmed the Conqueror (; ), was an Ottoman sultan who ruled from August 1444 to September 1446, and then later from February 1451 to May 1481. In Mehmed II's first reign, he defeated the crusade led by John Hunyadi after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the Peace of Szeged. When Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451, he strengthened the Ottoman navy and made preparations to attack Constantinople. At the age of 21, he conquered Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) and brought an end to the Byzantine Empire, permanently cementing its destruction. After the conquest Mehmed claimed the title Caesar of the Roman Empire (), based on the fact that Constantinople had been the seat and capital of the surviving Eastern Roman Empire since its consecration in 330 AD by Emperor Constantine I. The claim was only recognized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Nonetheless, Mehmed II viewed the Ottoman state as a continuation of the Roman Empire for the remainder of his life, seeing himself as "continuing" the Empire rather than "replacing" it. Mehmed continued his conquests in Anatolia with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as Bosnia. After conquering Constantinople and getting the Byzantines out of the way, he started making more conquests in the Balkans and focused on his Balkan campaigns, even unsuccessfully laying siege to Belgrade in 1456 at one point. He was also known for his rivalry with Vlad the Impaler, who grew up at his father's court alongside him. Vlad the Impaler had taken control over Wallachia and rebelled against the Ottoman Empire, thus Mehmed II sent an Ottoman army, resulting in a war between the two. The war ended when Vlad was killed by an Ottoman patrol in Wallachia. He was then beheaded with some saying his head was sent to Mehmed II himself at the capital city Constantinople (modern Istanbul) by the Ottoman soldiers. He was also known for his campaigns against Albanian rebel leader Skanderbeg. For most of his reign, Mehmed II was on campaign against either John Hunyadi, Vlad the Impaler or Skanderbeg. Domestically, he made many political and social reforms, encouraged the arts and sciences, and by the end of his reign, his rebuilding program had changed Constantinople into a thriving imperial capital. He is considered a hero in modern-day Turkey and parts of the wider Muslim world. Among other things, Istanbul's Fatih district, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge and Fatih Mosque are named after him. = = = The Bold and the Beautiful = = = The Bold and the Beautiful is a popular American soap opera. After "The Young and the Restless", it is the highest-rated soap opera there. The series is shown in over 100 countries. About 300 million people watch it every day. This makes "The Bold and the Beautiful" the most watched television series in the world. The first episode was shown on March 23, 1987 on the CBS network. The series was created by the soap opera writer William J. Bell and his wife, Lee Phillip Bell. It is the only American soap opera to have its daily episodes translated into Spanish for the Hispanic viewers in the United States. The series is set in Los Angeles, California. It tells the story of the Forrester family, who owns a fashion empire called Forrester Creations. The major members of the family are Eric Forrester (played by John McCook), the president of Forrester Creations, his wife Stephanie (Susan Flannery), their eldest son Ridge (Ronn Moss) and Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang), who was married to both the father and the son. She owns most of Forrester Creations. This is because she created "BeLieF", a formula which earned much money for the company. There used to be a second fashion company called Spectra Fashions. It was Forrester’s main competitor. The conflicts between the Forrester and the Spectra families was one of the major themes of the story. = = = Primary color = = = Primary colors (or primary colours in Commonwealth English) are sets of colors that can be mixed to make a useful range of colors. The primary colors are those which cannot be made by mixing other colors in a given color space. For an additive color model, as in overlapping projected lights or in television and computer screens, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. For a subtractive color model, as in mixing of pigments or dyes for printing, the CMY(K) set of primaries is often used. In this system the primary colors are cyan, magenta,and yellow. Other sets include the RYB system of red, yellow, blue, especially used by artists. Basis. Primary colors are not a part of light itself. Instead, they come from the eye's physiological response to light (the way the eye works). For humans, three primary colors are usually used. In other words, human color vision is trichromatic. Light is a spectrum of the wavelengths that can be seen by the human eye. It is an infinite-dimensional stimulus space. However, the human eye normally has only three types of color receptors, called cone cells. Each color receptor respond to different ranges of the color spectrum. Humans and other species with three types of color receptors are known as trichromats. The additive primary colors are red, green, and blue. Because of the response curves of the three different color receptors the human eye, these colors are optimal in the sense that the largest range of colors — a gamut — seen by humans can be made by mixing light of these colors. Additive mixing of red and green light, makes shades of yellow. Mixing green and blue makes shades of cyan. Mixing red and blue makes shades of magenta, such as purple. Mixing equal proportions of the additive primaries results in shades of grey; when all three colors are fully saturated, the result is white. This color space is called the RGB ("red, green, blue") color space. Subtractive primaries. Media that use reflected light and colorants to make colors are using the subtractive color method of color mixing. In the printing industry, to produce varying colors, the subtractive primary colors yellow, cyan, and magenta are applied together in varying amounts. Subtractive color works best when the surface or paper is white, or close to it. Mixing yellow and cyan produces shades of green; mixing yellow with magenta produces shades of red, and mixing magenta with cyan produces shades of blue. In theory, mixing equal amounts of all three pigments should make shades of grey, resulting in black when all three are fully saturated. In practice, they tend to make muddy brown colors. For this reason, a fourth "primary" pigment, black, is often used along with the cyan, magenta, and yellow colors. The color space with the fourth pigment is the CMYK color space. The abbreviation stands for "Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black" — K stands for "Kohle" (German for coal) and is used to represent black as 'B' could be confused with 'Blue'. Mixtures of real materials like paint tend to be less precise. Brighter, or more specific colors can be made using natural pigments instead of mixing, and natural properties of pigments can interfere with the mixing. For example, mixing magenta and green in acrylic makes a dark cyan - which would not happen if the mixing process were perfectly subtractive. = = = Umbilicus = = = The umbilicus (also called navel or bellybutton) is a place on the body of mammals that is left after a baby loses its umbilical cord. The umbilicus of humans is in the middle of the abdomen. It is usually only easy to see on humans, and is a thin line on many other mammals. In humans, they can be split into two different kinds, the kind that goes in (innie) and the kind that goes out (outie). Different people have different navels that can be different in size, shape, and looks, but these differences are not genetic (you do not get them from looks passed down in your family). The hepatic portal vein passes from the umbilical vein to the liver. When a person becomes fat, the fat usually goes around the umbilicus. It marks the water shed line of the body. The venus blood &amp; lymph do not cross the umbilical plane. = = = James Cook = = = Captain James Cook, FRS (7 November 1728 – 14 February 1779) was a British explorer, navigator and cartographer, the greatest of the 18th century. He sailed through the Pacific Ocean three times, mapped many areas and recorded several islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time. He was the first British sailor to visit both the east coast of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands. He made the first European maps of Newfoundland and New Zealand. He wrote extensively about all his discoveries. He sailed twice around the world. He crossed the Antarctic Circle and visited islands and landscapes in North America and the South Pacific. During his trips, he spent a lot of time on science and improving maps. He wrote books about what he found. Life. Cook was born on 7 November 1728 in Marton, Yorkshire, England. He was a son of a Scottish farmer. He was educated at the school in Great Ayton and at 17 he began work in a shop at Staithes. At 18, Cook became a sailor and an apprentice to John Walker of Whitby. Walker's business was transporting coal. Cook learned mathematics and navigation from Walker. He studied as much as he could about navigation and science. In 1755, he joined the Royal Navy. During the Seven Years' War, he participated in the conquest of Canada. After the war, he was sent on three expeditions all over the world with the ship "Endeavour". His goals on these missions were: Cook was killed in the Hawaiian Islands in a dispute about a stolen boat. Death of Captain James Cook. Cook died on the morning of 14 February 1779. Cook and his men launched from "Resolution" with a company of armed marines. Cook's party numbered eleven: Cook, Marines Lt Molesworth Phillips; Sgt Gibson; Corporals Thomas and Ledyard and six privates. They went directly to the ruling chief's enclosure where Kalaniʻōpuʻu was still sleeping. They woke him and directed him, urgently but without threat, to come with them. As Cook and his men marched the ruler out of the royal enclosure, Cook himself held the hands of the elder chief as they walked away from the town toward the beach. Kalaniʻōpuʻu's favorite wife, saw them as they were leaving and yelled after her husband, but he ignored her and did not stop. She called to the other chiefs and the townspeople to alert them to the departure of her husband. Two chiefs, Kanaʻina (Kalaimanokahoʻowaha), the young son of the former ruler, Keaweʻopala, and Nuaa, the king's personal attendant, followed the group to the beach with the king's wife behind them pleading along the way for the aliʻi nui to stop and come back. By the time they got to the beach, Kalaniʻōpuʻu's two youngest sons, who had been following their father believing they were being invited to visit the ship again with the ruler, began to climb into the boats waiting at the shore. Kānekapōlei shouted to them to get out of the boat and pleaded with her husband to stop. The ruler then realized that Cook and his men were not asking him to visit the ship, but were attempting to abduct him. At this point he stopped and sat down. Cook's men were confronted on the beach by an elderly kahuna who approached them holding a coconut and chanting. They yelled at the priest to go away, but he kept approaching them while singing the "mele". When Cook and his men looked away from the old kahuna, they saw that the beach was now filled with thousands of Native Hawaiians. Cook told Kalaniʻōpuʻu to get up but the ruler refused. As the townspeople began to gather around them, Cook and his men began to back away from the hostile crowd and raise their guns. The two chiefs and Kānekapōlei shielded the aliʻi nui as Cook tried to get him to his feet. Some of the crowd called up Cook was going to take their chief;one man advanced toward Cook but was stopped by a marine bayonet. Cook saw the danger of the crowd attacking him; the man who had advanced toward him claimed that his brother had just been killed by the ship's guns and he would be avenged. Cook fired twice at the man; first with a blank and then with ball striking his assailant in the groin. Cook saw that his designs were opposed, and that he could not succeed without bloodshed, ordered Lt Phillips to withdraw the marines and get into the boats. Cook was then hit on the head with a stone and shot and killed the man who had thrown it. The officer in the boats gave an order to fire. Cook and Philips in the rear of the guard perceiving the general fire without orders and ran to the shore to put a stop to it. Unable to make themselves heard they joined the guard who fired as they retreated. Cook reached the margin of the water between the fire of the boats and waved with his hat for them to cease firing and to come in. Kanaʻina angrily approached Cook, who reacted by striking the chief with the broad (flat) side of his sword. Kanaʻina jumped at Cook and grabbed him. Some accounts state that Kanaʻina did not intend to hit Cook while other descriptions say the chief deliberately struck the navigator across the head with his "leiomano". Either way, Kanaʻina pushed Cook, who fell to the sand. As Cook attempted to get up, Nuaa lunged at him and fatally stabbed him in the chest with a metal dagger, obtained by trade from Cook's ship during the same visit. Cook was stabbed just under the shoulder blade which passed through his body Cook fell with his face in the water. This caused a violent, close-quarters melee between the Hawaiians and Cook's men. Phillips killed the Chief who stabbed Cook with his sword Four of the Royal Marines (Corporal James Thomas and Privates Theophilus Hinks, Thomas Fachett, and John Allen) were killed and three (Including Phillips) were wounded; these three and three other marines made it to the boats. The remaining sailors and marines, heavily outnumbered, continued to fire as they retreated to their small boat and rowed back to their ship, killing several of the angered people on the beach, including possibly High Chief Kanaʻina. Lt Gore had the ships cannon fired on the crowd Cook's ships did not leave Kealakekua Bay until 22 February; they had remained for another week to continue repair of the mast and collect better-quality drinking water. They were obliged to fire upon the attacking natives and killed a number without loss to themselves. To terrorize the natives two of the dead warriors were beheaded and the heads stuck on the bows of the pinnances A young William Bligh, the future captain of , later claimed to have been watching with a spyglass from "Resolution" as Cook's body was dragged up the hill to the town by the Native Hawaiians, where it was torn to pieces by them. In fact the natives honoured Cook as a great Chief by the treatment of his remains. On the 22 and 23 of February the remains of Cook were returned to the ship. These were gathered up and buried in the Bay. Ironically the cutter which had been the cause of Cooks death could not be returned as it had been burned for iron. Cook's Family. He had four sons and one daughter. Their names were Elizabeth Cook, Hugh Cook, George Cook, Nathaniel Cook and Joseph Cook. His father, James Cook, had three sisters and two brothers. Their names were Mary Cook, who died at four; Margaret Cook; William Cook; Jane Cook and John Cook. = = = Offside rule = = = The offside rule is one of the oldest football rules, but is still a much discussed rule. This is probably because of the relatively complicated set of provisions provided by the sport's law-making body, the IFAB for deciding if a player in an offside position is actually guilty of an offside offence by becoming involved in active play. It can also be a difficult decision for the referee or assistant referee to make as they need to watch the ball, the player playing the ball and also the attacker who is seeking to receive the ball at the same time. Offside is an offence committed by the team which has the ball and is punished with an indirect free kick. It is a common misconception that the ball must be played forward for an offside offence to be committed. This is incorrect however, as an offside
