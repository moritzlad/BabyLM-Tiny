She's an old lady though Oh Arthur it's not that It is, yes, that's making it worse she's an old lady Could you have her to live with you? No she'd drive me up the wall I know I've said that and you said oh no I could cope with your mum and I thought I could, I thought I could I really thought I could but oh God I'd be okay if I could You'll never have any life you know could go deaf, if I could go selectively deaf, then I'll be alright You'll never have any life of your own would you? Well that's fair enough I never said she, she, I mean, I think, I blame myself as well I think I was on edge, but everything, everything she questions, you know, like she can't be nice, says no you're not having anything oh she says No I think that's just showing interest, that's the questioning that's just showing interest But then she'll ask you three times again, three times Yeah, that's, that's when it's hard she asks you the same thing again and again and a few minutes later, then half an hour later, then, then you think have you listened I've told you that, I mean today she was asking, she, she was standing there while I loaded the dishwasher she says I've got to learn how to do it haven't I? I thought oh go away What learn how to and that's how you do it She hasn't got one No but She's not going to get one really, really she with her she had to learn Oh I see, yeah, ah, go, she's just, she's just got to have something to do Yeah, but anything she does takes her such a long time, I mean like the ironing like Well yeah but she is seven seventy isn't she has it always taken her or has it?

I wonder if Philip was or wasn't You wonder if Philip was what? purely that he was really just Oh I think it was psychological that if it was he's in a bad way int he? Erm, well what your mum and dad said to me is that he gets very worried, het up, really tensed about doing things, that's going, you know, things that are gonna happen, like just driving down to a different place, er and he get's himse himself so het up , so worried, he makes himself ill, I think that's what's happened And as soon as he got home the pressure was off The pressure was off and he was fine and he was he was his normal self and that's what happens each time Yeah cos if it was as bad as he said it was, I mean he would only stand up for one or two hours at a time, whereas he'd been up since nine, he was still sitting up at one o'clock when I arrived there Yeah, he made a miraculous recovery today and I think that seems to point or to confirm what your, what your mum and dad was saying Well that sort of problem will only get worse Yeah I'm afraid so, I think it's compounded by the fact that your, what your dad says sums it up beautifully about your mum, I was talking to him about, you know, what does she, what she's got in her life other than what she ever had other than a home, working and so on, has she got any hobbies at home or does she do anything is there anything that takes her mind off things Yeah, but she still has Philip and he says no she hasn't, she, her hobby is Philip but as soon as Philip can't do what she wants him to do I E run to the door Then she turns on him then she turns on him then she turns on him, yes I mean I hate the way she stands behind somebody mouths and Mimics mimics them and that, oh I hate that, I hate that as I say a few times I thought to myself I do not like You are my mother Yeah the Germans are out are they?

Yeah Yeah, and if he becomes just an auto run it could just knock him back a bit, one of the crowd, you know, just another one Do you think that's likely to happen? Er, I hope I don't think I don't think it will, but I'm sure it wouldn't do at the other two places Ah, so which one were you hoping he'd gone for? I was hop I hadn't, I hadn't really made up my mind that's plenty biscuits Paula, yeah it's plent don't get, biscuit mania, Easter eggs, God Oh, do you want a Cadbury's Creme Egg? No I don't when is Easter, it's late isn't it? It's ages, ages April, it's another six weeks yet isn't it? Yeah What you looking for? Anything special? What do you want? Pardon? What do you want? Oh let's have a Crunchie you Nothing oh dear erm No Northgate no I think it's the speciality is that, in him and how he reacts with people, it isn't you know just what he's good at or not good at You don't think he'll be er Don't think he'll what? you know got enough to go to university, things like that to of been top dog all your school life, it might do you good not to be Yeah, but it depends what, how it takes, what form it takes if he's if it's sort of their others are of similar ability, okay, but if it's because, if people don't take any notice of him because of Oh yeah, mm, mm no just because of they're that type, they don't take any notice of anybody Yeah, yeah but you think that, that'll happen at Northgate? you know, don't take an interest in them as people Think that could happen at Northgate? I think that could happen anywhere, but but It does have implications mind you for Paul, cos where's Paul gonna go? No it doesn't, he, he doesn't have to follow his brother's footsteps No he's got to be his own person he's got to be himself, for, yeah selfish it's been easier for us for transport problem, if Paul decides to go somewhere else I think you've got to give 'em them freedom to do it, freedom of choice Oh where Nathan goes Really, so Paul is in, hasn't got freedom then? He's been with him since primary school, it'll be nice to go to, cos they're going off to America when they've finished Is that right? Is that what Paul said? Paul's gonna bum around for a year I reckon Good, it'll do him good I think, I think he needs to do it No I just think he needs to do it Oh he might never settle down He, he just might grow up a little bit cotton wool, Tony oh yes, which ones I don't know which ones they like There's, there's one of these beef and tomato I think, I seem to recognize that Yeah it might as you say with Paul but I'd be more worried about Paul bombing around every year than Tony I'd be more worried about Tony, cos I don't think Tony's as well wise as Paul is, in some ways really for both of them it wouldn't do them any harm you know because look, they're, they're, they're not typical lads in many ways which I they're not typical lads in many ways are they? I'd rather they'd university than before you know I rather did it before because if you do it after that's when the job situation becomes a bit of problem, look at John, look what's happening there You can't blame John, he didn't want a job, he can't turn round now and say he's got the wrong degree, he didn't want a job Don't know, I've never spoken to him at all, don't know He didn't want a job that's what he had said he wanted to have time out he didn't want a job he could get a job when he wanted to, he can't now turn round and blame it on The degree the degree Oh God do you want some toast then?

This year's, no this year's trigger money This year's trigger this year's trigger money Ah so I just want to carry that over Yeah earmarked for alterations to Pauline's guttering Yeah and then I'll only have to carry forward of about three thousand, plus me twelve thousand deposit So they'll have fifteen thousand on deposit Mm Ooh I reckon I'll be using some of that, I'm, I'm gonna use I've got less than you But, hold on and now, I've got more expensive staff than you. Yeah, but, er, I've got six thousand carried forward from last year, okay you've got twelve they've got six Pass it over yeah, see what I mean, and this year, the budget Which? I've got this year it's all accounted for, I can't take anything out of it Well I think I'm in a position and, and put it to and put it into a deposit, you know this, this building I want, at the back, there's, there's nothing there, pardon? Oh I should of shown you me car you would of been impressed Well, yeah, there's plenty of time, I don't think sort of, it's not a magic one is it? Is it gonna fly?

Yes, that's because of the floor area And your numbers of, and, what you, how many kids have you got? At the moment? January number Sixty seven Yeah you see I've only got fifty two and I've got eight hundred quid less than you Crazy innit? Yeah, but I've still got three but the implication, the big your biggest charge on the school is the staff Yeah that's why it's crazy you see it, oh, it doesn't make sense that so much emphasis is put on floor area if er less emphasis is put on floor area and more on children three, top of the scale you see Er, yeah, but there's a heck of an I'm gonna be really pushed because it, the biggest cost us teachers and the number of teachers you need is governed by the number of Children children you have Except the twenty five, fifty two in two classes I'm not, I'm not saying that you should have any is not good I, I don't think you should have any less money, I'm saying that we should have more, we are, we're losing out Yeah you're not gaining it's No it's us that are losing out we're better than you there should be more emphasis on, on number of children that was lucky, it's on this side isn't it?

We won't, we won't have snow drifts we'll have soil, soil drifts, as daft as that, God where is all this traffic coming from?

Southampton, Southampton Is it only office hours? Mm Does er we need to know things like that and if you I still question whether we'll go Why? if there are problems If these are the problems Mm or not Oh have you got that on? Mm, doesn't matter If there are the problems of taxes and taxes? Mm That's why I don't, well if the Hungarians are gonna charge is it two thousand pounds or something? Mm If they go and charge that we we can't afford that Well no you get it back supposedly Yeah, but if you get it back in funds well that's no use to you is it? Who's gonna take two thousand pounds worth of pounds out of Hungary? Who? I don't know yet Nobody in their right mind, do you remember that, were you there when that guy from Kuwait Mm, mm tried to change Mm his foreign and done it, done it all legally at the hotel and so on Yeah and the state he was in and they didn't want to know did they? They more or less called him a fool when he tried to change back into whatever it was our current whatever it was and if that's the case erm Hungar Hungarians are holding on to this two thousand pound, it's surety isn't it? Mm You'd be stoned dead and it's if they're taxing on the border well, well that's what it is but if you can get into Romania Into Romania as well you're being double blowed I can't see that honestly I just, I just I can can't see them I can seeing it as an import so they're taxing imports Mm, yeah I think I wouldn't of thought they'd be so thick skinned as to turn away help, that so much help, I just can't see it They've had, not just from Britain they've had help, they've had it from all over Europe and it's still Yeah, but it's still going in, the media's involved in it as well, I would of thought people like Anneke Rice would of picked that up Are you going to try her again Yeah, I'm trying to get this ready for tomorrow, I'm just Well it's, it's gonna be very late there, you'll be getting her out of bed if you're not careful I know she says it doesn't mind, she, she doesn't mind it doesn't matter, but oh dear, there's a piece here in the newspaper did you see that? Yeah Mrs have you heard of her? I read it Have you heard of her? No No I don't, she's obviously been before or been involved with it before What time does Tony want picking up? About twenty past the same route Same as Paul Mm Right mm wonder which way this paper's going to go, on the election, there's a piece here about title that that's no way to treat a lady no, I think it's all to do with, yeah it looks like An Access card had been found at a meeting of the Liberal Democrats for Eastern Region contracts, and, M S Sue Sutton, who was a candidate for South West Hampstead they've found, and the paper says the grey haired woman who to collect the card but did Ms Sutton gracefully rise from her seat to hand it to her, no, she tossed it over the rim of the platform onto the floor below leaving the poor woman to scrabble around for several minutes looking for it and the, and the punch line is a little later an embarrassed Ms Sutton is contesting Cambridgeshire South West for the Lib Dems at the general election, apologised for her cavalier behaviour, let us hope she learnt from the experience yeah Mm now what on earth has that got to do with a policy of a political party, the way somebody handles a lost Access card I wonder, mm? No way . Oh yeah. . Er Weetabix bag right,. she'll give you a weetabix bag. No it's it's like er everyone joined in Oh. and and I went and I . Why don't you use it then? Because cos I used to take it down there when I used to stay at her house. Weetabix bag. It used to glow . Was it like a rucksack or No it was just one of those . Yeah Mm? What did we do on Friday? we don't get a Friday homework. No but what did we do for science? We did the test. Oh yeah oh no . Me and Lisa have to do it. Why? Cos we weren't here on Friday. Oh. Well I was here but I came during break time. Oh I see. . What have you got in your mouth? Except for the bit.. chewing gum. . Did you watch naked ? Yeah. Oh I saw that one . Did you see him taking those shots every time . I only like the the white ones are horrible . No the ones with the red and the grey. The white and the white grey and red . do they have patterns at the side? . That was horrible. I like the . Did you see him at his party . I know. I said why why would which are, sort of, erm, self confidence and things, and erm, how you you express yourself, and then a third one is like sex an and gender and age. Do you have to do all this from the tapes that have been recorded. Well. Yeah, you're meant to do your own recordings. If if not, you supposed to record, they're supposed to be, in fact, two minutes, and I couldn't read, 'cos two minutes is about half two sides of of transcript, so that's all we need really. So it's otherwise, it would be just too big to analyse. Plus, all us, we had to do erm, transcribe five minutes. Well do you know how long that would, Mm. can you imagine how long that would take, it would just be impossible. We were o on and I thought, no way, and then Marianne said, no, it's ju , she said, that's too much, we'll be, and like, erm,, we'll knock off er, five hundred words of your assignment, if you do five minutes of thing, and that's, no way. , really. you're gonna do well over five hundred words, bloody writing it out. so Marianne well, she said, she said, well okay then, do five hundred. Like both sides, to do like two and a half pages. Well, I don't mind doing that. Thing is, they say, take half an hour to transcribe two minutes, but that's probably by professionals anyway. It does, the thing is, if you've got a lot of speakers Mm. Becaus I mean, the the one I've got here,the one I've got, erm, er that I taped on Saturday night, there's seven people on it, and they all keep cutting across each other on it, it would just be impossible. Mm. Was it a good conversation, though? Bet that was good though The effects when listening back to it. How are you It was just like being at the cinema, but it's just like being, it's just like being in the room again, because of the conversation's back. Was this seven girls, or No, there's there's Phil, and erm, Nicole's erm, the girl she lived with last year, her and her boyfriend came. Oh. So there's two blokes and five girls. And we, it's really funny because of we started off the evening talking about leg waxing . The conversation keeps coming back to leg waxing at every quarter of an hour, it's really funny. Really. Yeah. Oh my God. No. Who does it then? And erm, I was telling my mum and dad about that, No, everyone was bringing it back, it was, Ben from bringing it back to it. And Claire did, and so did Charlotte, it was really oh. I I told my mum and dad about that on Sunday, that she's got a leg waxing machine. I said she had been trained properly, I was telling them just basically about Claire in general and just about the good of erm, things like things you like to talk about, and erm, so I just, I said, they cried poverty, I said, but you know, one minute she's driving her old banger, and the next minute she's got a K reg and outside the , And then I said, then she'd been bought a a hundred pound of leg waxing machine. Does it look good on. I hope She shares it with her mum. I don't think her mum uses it very much. 'Cos I imagine it to be really sort erm, medieval Hi. Hi yeah. really, really old. I don't know, I I d , they're very expensive, I should imagine. I wouldn't bother with one. Hi yeah. Have you seem them, then. Yeah. How are you? Fine. No. Arr. What is that? not the only one. That's nice. You got your tickets? Mm. Oh, that was quick So you've got to flog another one to someone. No, no, no, Kerry's coming, erm, Oh, that's good. she's in Northampton, she's Oh, right, that's good. And she said she'd come. I've just phoned her up just to tell her. Jolly gee. I'm gonna see on Thursday, Are you? afternoon. How much did it come to? Only five fifty, I think. Oh, really. Yeah. What is it? It's called Two Gentlemen of Veronna? Ohh. I don't know what it's about. I think, Is it good? Mm. It's meant to be really funny, Yeah. and it's meant to be a really good production. Is that the R S C? Mm. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Is it in the pit, or is it in the the theatre? I don't where it is, er Nicole just s said, do you want to come, and I said, oh yeah okay, it's only gonna cost a fiver. Yeah. lot of things, if they weren't erm, we're doing theatre and drama next term. Oh, right. so. Actually, I I want, don't know whether you want interested in coming, I'm not sure whether I wanna go, but either next week, it'll have to be next week, 'cos I think after I won't be here, I'm going home. There is a play showing at erm, The Orange Tree, it's by Faye Weldon. I don't know whether you Oh, yeah. She wrote, The Love and Lives of the She Devil, and she's written it, she wrote it especially for The Orange Tree Theatre about ten years ago, and now she's re-doing it, It's already recording, yeah. Now she's re-written it, and er, it's gonna be shown there, and it's only, seats gonna be about a fiver, if you go, er in the afternoons. If you were going. Mm. Where's that? The Orange Tree erm, Theatre. There's a play on by, it's called Mr Director. It's on by Faye, it's written by Faye Weldon. Oh. And erm, I want to go and see it Well, I'll go on my own, if need be. I'm just asking if anyone's interested Yeah, I'll go. I thought about going on Monday. Erm, the twenty-sixth, I think. Let's see if I go home, yet. Yeah, well, I I I might, it might not be definite, but I think they want to go and see it before it goes on, and it's only a fiver, and I'd really like to see it. How, how are those things made. It's got erm, it's with the same Sheba, Mm. Erm, I just went upstairs, to see if I've got a blank tape, and I haven't got a blank tape. How did er T V go this morning? Excellent. Yeah, what was you doing to him, Camera C. So was I, I was doing camera two. Excellent. It's brilliant, innit. Really, really enjoying it. Oh, that was erm. Turn it up. Oh it's not fair No, I love th , erm the acting was excellent this morning. Was it, oh good. Have you managed to get lots of volunteers to do your outing with Mary and Fiona. well,sort of, erm. nurses, yeah are you doing the same things. Yeah, the same thing. Erm, 'cos I I didn't put an at all, and like the three blokes, there were only three lads and us anyway. So, so they had to do it. What, that's a bit out of order, innit, poor sods. They sort of went mm alright. Yeah. So they did it, and erm Is it a play? Yeah, we did Yeah, we had to call it, Lear's Lily Lily And, her nurse. And I just kept quiet. And erm, I just sat there and thought, I'm not doing it, Yeah, if they ask me, I'm not doing it, I'm sorry. And erm, And I really like, really work psyched myself up for it. And who did it in the end, who's doing it? Erm, Alice said she would do Lily, So you had to ask actual Oh, yeah. erm, and Martin and Den had already volunteered to be in it, Yeah. and then, David, was so- sort of bludgeoned into doing it. oh. David Brush. David Brush, and we we're still wa we're waiting on a Lily, so I think we might be asking Naomi to do our Lily for u I mean nurse er, nurse for us, 'cos we haven't got a nurse. Well, there's so part, you know, what I thought, I really would like to do to camera, and I was a bit, thought, well, everyone's gonna want to do camera so That's what I thought, and nobody wants to do it. Nobody wants, no, and I I started our first one, and I said I would, normally I I put my hand up, 'cos I wanted to direct. I'll do it . Yeah, and erm,yeah. quite nice as well actually, because there's not that many shots, and there's a nice break between all of them, isn't there. Yeah, and there nice easy shots, really. Yeah. Yeah, and erm, Sounds cools, doesn't it. I wish I could have a go. It is really I loved it, I was really enjoying it. I thought, yeah, this is what I wanna do. Have you got erm, you know you have the screen, and the monitor screen, have you got s , you know like they have on T V, the the writing that comes on, sort of, like a telephone number comes on the bottom of it, is it, have you got that, special things like that. Yes, you can do that. What, what, You can do, you can put you can put like credits up and you can put, you could put Mm. a telephone number up, couldn't you? It's just superimposed on the bottom. At the bottom of it, yeah. It's amazing what they can do, innit. In a way, I wish I was doi I wish I could equal acting on T V. Do you? I really liked I liked to do T V, I'd like to do camera work. Yeah. Would you have to go to university. Yeah. or just six weeks. No, it's for, it carries on till the end of semester one. What's art and techniques, then? Living theatre. The living theatre takes up, it comes up in the living theatre. The living theatre, yeah. whatever it is And do we then stop our majors or what? I would imagine so, yeah, I think, then you pick them up in year three if you want to. Which meant if I did it in year three, which I'd liked to, then you'd obviously equal or went into drama. 'Cos I I like my English, I don't want to er, I don't know, I see how this year goes. Or m minor my English. Well, it all depends how it goes. Yeah. I mean, at the moment, I don't know if minor isn't, if if you minor English, isn't it just major authors, Yeah, that all I w Is it? That's what really pisses me off, 'cos I'd like to the whole Oh, really? that's what I didn't know. I wanted to fo major authors.

But Yeah, you can go on a major or equal, can't you. I thought perhaps then you just can't single. make use of them. No. no. You just can't single in any of them, but next year there doing single language, aren't they? Yeah. drama Or they're doing single They're doing it now, they're doing Single Irish. I didn't think it was all subjects, I thought it was just history No. I thought it was like history and English and erm, the tape with that one we just do well gone the same than bloody English, then I think I'd go abroad.

And you made you in like camera work, or could you actually I really don't know, I really don't know, Maria, I'm very badly informed on it, I'm afraid. Like with most of my subjects. I don't know what's going on. I was asking today in the English seminar, asking Mr Stevens if they knew about the erm, exam structure. Right. And nobody knew about it, no-one No, we haven't been told at all, have we? I think we should have said at the first the very first lesson, they just ploughed straight into didn't they? 'Cos I just, I feel as if I'm much less aware of what's going on this year. Than you were last year, yeah. Definitely I just don't what is And it's and it's bad really, because this is actually our degree, this year. I mean Last year, you know, totally rat-arsed. now, he's putting up a list of all the poems he wants us to look at for next week. Oh, my God, I thou I don't know why I bothered buying Alchemist, it's Well, you never know, you might have to study it then for the exams. Yeah, I suppose I might, if I have to. One of the girls, today, she wasn' say she wasn't sure, but she was saying that she heard that perhaps the exam structure you have to incorporate all three phases of the Yeah, I think you might do. If I'm happy, then I'll do it obviously. Yeah But I would rather not. I might go and see Dave and see if he's got any more books today. not been on for ages. what was that? Me. I had Q T erm granules when they first came out, and they were the most revolting That's white tea, though, isn't it? Yeah. Yes, white. It's horrid. I mean, I can't imagine that I'd ever want to drink anything you know, erm, Instant white tea, that sounds gross. The whole point of tea, is that it has to brew, isn't it. Mm. Oh, is this on tonight? I don't watch this. Mm. The Queen goes up to that girl with the eyebrows, and she goes,and how are you today? I'm fine, but she's just nicked my eyebrows She's saying well keep them. No. I saw another place In fact, I'm I really need them Oh, that's just the upper hand isn't it. Is the kettle full then? Yeah, Beckie's filling it. Oh, well. No. Penny today, then? No, I haven't seen her. Thought she would have come round yesterday. She probably be round at some point today, won't she? Yeah. She has on Tuesdays. Shall I make another pot of tea. Oh, yes. Oh, sorry. So what have you been doing this morning Em, lots of work. Erm,no T V to be perfectly frank. I was going to No, no. Richard and Judy, erm, Oh God. I had one of those yoghurts last night, and they are so nice. so gross. Really? Yeah. Which one? out yoghurts. for fourteen p. fourteen p. Is there erm, is there any fruit in them, or not? Yeah. Yeah, brilliant. fat No. What flavour did you get.? I just got three strawberry ones, and three They only do strawberry, oh, and I hate it in yoghurts they're Stra er, strawberry, black cherry, I think. Oh. Or peach melba, but I only like strawberry but I thought I love their skin. Yeah, but everything, all yoghurts are so expensive, aren't they, you know? There's an offer at the moment sixty four. So, I mean, that's not bad, but most of them are about one twenty for four, aren't they? Which is taking the piss, really, isn't it. That's like getting on for thirty P a yoghurt. Buy them individually, they are. Yeah, M and S you are, they ask about thirty P They are, they're extortionate prices. If you buy a Shape yoghurt on its own. Oh yeah. They're about thirty-two P Yeah,show you. M and S yoghurts were thir were thirty-one P I think, over the summer. Really? They were on special offer all summer. I think they're supposed to be thirty-four, normally. And that, did they erm, set yoghurts as well, by any chance, 'cos I prefer set yoghurts. No. I hate set yoghurts. I don't think so. No, I'm not great lover of yoghurts. 'Cos I just mash them up, first. Yeah. No, 'cos I only like little ones. I can I can't eat a full yoghurt, so a little set yoghurt Yeah. Fromage frais is is perfect for me, so there. yoghurt. What? Yoghurts with I Q. Oh no, it's like, it's like with chocolate as well, I cut it up into little pieces, because I can't eat it all at once . I just don't like, she'll eat them. Well, you know what I mean. Ah. Sorry, I didn't ask if you wanted any more tea. No. You don't have to, but we live here. We should offer you I know. so we don't, I mean, I don't Help yourself. Okay. Has anyone, has anyone got any change of a fifty pence piece. I have. I have but I need for the I need it for the, er going into the er, washing machine. Oh. What's it for, to ring Kerry? Yeah. You not, your not looking at me What, what I'm not looking at you? Are you? You are, 'Cos you look as if you're I mean, you know I look like a fly trap, yeah. I mean, it looked as if you were looking at my chest, and just staring at my chest. No, but I think you're just totally right. Oh, my life. I think that, I don't know, it just seemed as if you were looking at me like Yeah. Oh dear. Have you been eating your muffins in there. Hope Your not phoning Kerry now before eight Yeah. Yes. Aren't I allowed to? No. My god, it's two o'clock in the afternoon. Are you phoning her now, why don't you phone her at seven. 'Cos I'll probably forget then. I was just thinking, I'd phone now, to do something, 'cos I'm bored. And your money was going twice as quick. Do some Alchemist. Yeah. Yeah. It looks so don't it? Mm. I'll make a pot of tea. I'm going to the loo. What's that in there? Cottage cheese and Marmite. Ah, I love and Marmite. Yes, so do I. And cucumber. Actually, Rose, could you give it another ten minutes, because Nicole will probably come round, and then we'll make a big pot of tea for all of us. Well, I'll make it, it will really nice, won't it? If you just right, lack of motivation at the moment, I need to get a glass of Lucozade I think. You want to you know me. You think it really works, though. Sorry? Do I think it really works? Do you think Lucozade really works? I when I've been ill. Yeah, so have I. Lucozade. Mm. It just not a drink I buy. Tastes nice when you're Tastes nice when you're ill, but What's everything tastes nice when you're ill Just gives you a , does it? Yeah, it's supposed to. Yeah. I mean, I do find it nice when when I got flu or something, I just it's cold, really really cold, really cold. have you. Doing now I'd rather do than sitting here. they started doing diet Tizer. Have they? Yeah, 'cos Tizer's the only one they haven't been doing diet, and I've been getting really pissed off. Yeah, I've got half a in the fridge, actually. Yeah, they do diet now. in the fridge. But I've only seen it in some of the I bet it tastes crap. I bet it don't. Tizer. Mind you, I don't mind diet drinks. What, yeah. When we used to drink Tizer. Mm. We used to buy it in Safeways. My dad used to buy it, always used to buy it on a Sunday evening. But I ne I'm going back years, 'cos I was on a diet, thinking, aw, I'm not drinking that, its got sugar in it. But now it's diet, I'll now definitely drink it. Is it just erm, because it's got sugar in it, or because I won't drink any diet drinks that are not diet if they're fizzy, because they've got so much sugar in 'em. You'd like teaspoon and teaspoons of it, Yeah. I just, the idea of eating that much sugar in er, just a glass of drink That's why I think I'm really lucky, because I don't like, sort of fizzy drinks, I can't drink 'em. Oh, I love fizzy drinks. I can't drink fizzy drinks. I only drink wine if it's fizzy. I'm like, Yeah, wine's is all. and they had white wine, or, er, red wine, and I went, oh have you got any lemonade. Like, don't you want any wine, I said I I only really like it when it's fizzy. Yeah. So I had some, Claire bought this Greek wine, and it was sweet, and I You know like, if I'm really thirsty, I could just gulp down a glass of water or a glass of orange, just like that, but with fizzy drinks, I don't know, I can't swallow them very easily, just sort of er, They're really good at aren't they? She's so fussy. Yeah. No, you were fussy as well. What, what am I fussy about? Fussy about everything. Oh, right. About leaving things around, things not being left in I don't like a mess, but No, I think I've got a right to be fussy. mm. I'll just eat anything. You fussy about your tea. Yeah. I like my tea. coffee actually. It has to be not too strong and not too weak. What Sam went through oh. So it can be weak, or If you do get a drink, she'll make a pot, and it'll have like one tea-bag in it. And like she'd pour it out and it's really really weak and insipid, and I go, oh,do you mind if I add a tea-bag to that. 'Cos she doesn't drink it with milk, so it don't really matter to her. Yeah. Mm. 'Cos my mother, likes it really strong, and you like it really strong, Mm. but sometim I used to drink really quite strong before, but I decided to give up erm, like, take less sugar, so if you take less sugar, I think I only took two sugars anyway, 'cos my tea was so strong, 'cos 'cos the stronger it is, you need more sugar to sweeten it. So I decided to give up one sugar and you know, I have to take it sort of weak weaker anyway. It's better for me, 'cos there's less caffeine, and I drink a lot of tea, so. So it's better. But I would try and give up sugar altogether, but I don't know. Well, you need to just give it up and I can't stand tea with sugar in it. I know. That's the way I did it. Because, I I I You can't reduce it and reduce it, 'cos then you're still depending on it. I did it with erm, with er, I went from one and a half and I'm down to one, 'cos I was, I I've tasted my father's sometimes, 'cos he thinks two and a half, he used to take three,and I'm like aw it's Er. My dad used to take two sugars, and when I said I was giving up sugar in tea and coffee, he reduced it to one. Yeah? Mm. 'Cos I think if I'd said, right I'm gonna give it up, I wouldn't drink tea ag again, 'cos I wouldn't be able to drink it, sort of without sugar. Mm. What about sweeteners. How about trying those? Mm. It's funny, I thought about sweeteners the other day, I think it's just as bad as sugar, I think. No, they're not, they got no calories in them, they've got something like nought point, nought, nought calories in them. No, it's not er calories, I'm thinking about erm, ruining my teeth, that's the only reason Yeah,in your teeth. It's not like putting a massive like spoon, if you think about it, right, if you have a spoonful of sugar in your tea, Mm. it's just like drinking, it's just like getting a spoonful of sugar and sticking it in and wiping it around. Yeah. You just diluting it a bit in the the erm, tea. And if you drink as much tea as you say you do, just think how many teaspoons of sugar you have a day, extra. Mm. But I don't have any sugar in anything else, I don't I don't eat chocolate or anything, so that's a have got sugar in. Yeah. I only drink, what have you. Sweet and sour sauce has got loads and loads of sugar in it. You'd be surprised the amount of things that have got sugar in. Yeah. Yeah. You'd be surprised. All sauces and that, have all got a load of sugar in. Mm. Especially things like salad cream. My mother, she decided to give up sugar, I think it was about one year. Well, she just decided to give it u to give it up, she never used to take much anyway. But erm, she used to take one in coffee and nothing in suga , I mean in tea, I think, and then she just gave it up, and she said it, she hated it for ages, and then one day she she tasted, she drank my father's and she said it was absolutely foul That's what I'm like, I drink sugar with it. Yeah. she going,horrible, innit. I did that the other week,sort of going yuk Mm. My mum drinks it black, so. What, tea? Yeah. Why's that? She just always has done. All her family, like they all just drink tea with a very little drop of milk in it, and she always drank it with a little drop of milk, and then, she decided not to drink it with milk at all. Yeah. So she has two sugars instead . Sometimes, I've, I've had tea without milk, and it doesn't taste that different really, it's just If you have skimmed milk, it doesn't. like water anyway. It's just at the end it is, it's bitter at the end. You know, when I've tried it without milk, I just don't, I just leave about that much at the end, 'cos it gets really bitter. I never usually finish my tea, down Oh, I do. but coffee I drain the cup, but tea I don't. I couldn't do that. I do. My mum always used to say that, why haven't you drunk this little bit of tea in the bottom, but I never do. Just, you would always leave a little bit of tea in the bottom of the cup, I don't know why. A phobia, I think there was somethin a spider at the bottom. social convention. No, when, when we drink it at home, because there are, not Yeah. not tea leaves as such, but there is Yeah, residue. tea in the bottom of the cup, so it doesn't taste very nice. Because, I mean there is a difference between fresh tea and and er loose tea, and erm tea-bags, because there is Do you have tea-bags at home? Yeah, we have tea-bags at home, but downstairs, the tea machine, you gotta use erm, well, they use loose tea. I mean, it is different, I never used to like the loose tea, when I was younger, but now I I sort of really taste the difference. I didn't, never used to taste as nice. But now, I I like it, I don't why. Well, Auntie had a tin of loose tea and tea-bags all day, like normal days, they drink tea=bag tea. But if we go round there,and they get the china cups out. get the get the drinks. loose tea. My mum 'cos it's so much cheaper to buy them the more . No, we're not on the tea-bags this week, What just I've just spent all my shopping, so you've got tea leaves. Yeah, it is it is cheaper to Oh, yeah, very, very much cheaper. Look at that. You're just paying for the convenience, aren't you, really with tea-bags, that they're just all sealed, you know. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah. Not for anything else, really. Still the same flavour inside. I tell you what. No, I'm jut showing that I'm a bit bored, though Bit bored. Tell you what is such a big con, was when the round tea bags came out, the round tea-bags. They're nearly all round now, though, aren't they? I think that's such a con, they even had adverts They they're erm, their better flavour for, Oh, fuller flavour all round. Er. I know. What does it matter if it's in a square bag or a round bag. I bet if they brought it, done it in star shapes, people would go out and buy them. I do prefer the round ones, though. I know it's stupid. I do. I know it's pathetic, you know, I much rather have round ones. They look nicer in the cup. My mother though, she's er, she's does, she's not fussy about loose tea leaves, but she's gotta have a Glengetti tea-bag. She's a Thai. She won't drink any other tea. Erm, it's just the brand, yeah. It's the brand. Never heard of them, have you? No. Glengetti? Welsh brand. Oh, is it. Yes, erm,was saying to me Could you send her down here. No, no,but erm, like was saying, she doesn't reckon they are Welsh. She doesn't think they are Welsh. With a name like Glengetti. I know, that's what I said Welsh, Scottish, or Irish she says she reckons that it's Scottish, it's a Scottish brand, but you know, I don't think it must be. in the er, dark ages. They are nice. Do your parents But speaking to you I know you don't, sorry Carry on. Your go. Erm, I know your parents don't really eat much sweet stuff, but do you have, generally have any sweet stuff in the house, really or is it No. No. Like we might buy, my sister is, she loves chocolate, my mother would buy her packet of of Secrets or something, she buy a Yeah. six pack or something, but my mother very rarely buys biscuits or anything. Really. Because we got biscuits downstairs, anyway,any way, so sometimes my mother has a cup of tea, and might just say oh go and get me erm, a Twirl, what are those twirl things. Walnut, walnut whip, that's it. Yeah. Oh, go and get me that packet of digestive biscuits I'm not a great eater of No, none of us really We've always got sweets up in our house, but then again we've got young children. They eat so much. Yeah. But what's the point in stocking up, Mm. if you've got it all downstairs, we can just nip downstairs. Mm. That's true. Like if the shop was separate, if we had our own, sort of, house. You just, you live quite a bit out of the shop. Do you get quite a stuff from the shop. Well, we haven't got a fridge upstairs. Oh. And I've been nagging my parents. At one point about three years ago, they said, right, we'll gonna buy a small fridge, so at least we can keep bread, milk, and things like that upstairs. And Yet you got a proper kitchen upstairs. Yeah, we've got a proper kitchen, we just haven't got With a cooker? Yeah fridge. Oh, what a pain in the arse, you have to go downstairs. Yeah. So, in the mornings, Is there space for a fridge? Not really. There'd be a space on the wall, perhaps small fridge, one of those small little ones, so you can just put the bare essentials in. But like, erm, in the holiday, sort of sometimes if I get up late, I'll come downstairs, and my mother's brought everything up, like the milk, the butter and cheese and br er bread's upstairs, but. But otherwise, I've got to go downstairs. Or if my mother comes up, and I'm sort of just getting up, she says, oh do you want me to bring stuff up, or ideally, I usually say or I'll come downstairs and get breakfast. But that's what I hate, I've got to go downstairs to get my breakfast. Oh, what pain. Got to go downstairs to get my lunch, it's really If you've got a kitchen, it defeats the object, really, doesn't it? Oh, no, 'cos you you you go cook upstairs, we've got a cooker That's what I mean. You've got to go downstairs to get everything. If you've got a kitchen upstairs, it defeats the object of you're having a fridge Unless you bring up and down the stairs. wouldn't you. The thing is though, we've got erm, got one, two, three, four, we've got five fridges. You know, and and the one we use for the shop, for the kitchen, is just a converted drinks machine, so it's massive. It really is big. It's a big huge fridge. So we just keep everything in there. And like all the lettuce, the you know, all the foods that are usually used in the shop, we just use it for ourselves anyway. It, I go downstairs and my mother will make a big box of of tuna mayonnaise, I just get the tuna mayonnaise box, get some suga , you don't It's quite handy really, We don't have our separate yeah. Yeah. We don't have our separate stuff, sort of thing, my mother will make sort of, bulk of egg mayonnaise, like the other day, I thought, I'll make egg mayonnaise now. Made two, erm, cooked two eggs, and it lasted me two days, whereas you know, usually if I go downstairs, I don't have to make anything, because all their pre-prepared anyway. Mm. Still it Like usually the top shelf, is usually our own stuff. Our own sauces, or whatever, erm, if my mother makes a cake, it goes on to the top shelf, but usually we just use everything. We've got bread and milk. Ours is a bit like erm, Tesco's really, so much in it. Honestly, there's such a good su stock in our kitchen, you could live for a week. 'Cos my mum's got one of these people that always keeps the stock up, she won't let it get really low, Yeah. she keeps stocking up every day. Yeah, But what ha , what Aladdin's cave. Stop scratching your leg. I'm n I'm just erm, just . What I find though, erm,becau my, because we got so much stuff coming in for the shop anyway, like the lettuce or the fruit and veg, my parents don , you know, like most people go,yo your mother probably goes, how many, how often does she make a shopping trip? Probably gets something every day. Well, like, you know, not to be My mum, erm, once every two weeks. See, my parents hardly ever go. My father will go to the cash and carry every week, and perhaps he'll pop into into Tesco's or something and get a few bits and pieces, so we got a lot in the fridge, but it's not a lot of variety. No. So, erm, you know, my mother like, if she, if she needs something, she just asks me just to pop to erm, Gateways. Occasionally my parents will go to Tesco's and then it's not like, with lots of people probably spend about a hundred pound, even more probably, wouldn't they? But you know, my parents would pay, probably spend about thirty or something. Wouldn't spend a lot. And Kerry at home, young girl whom I'm going to see erm, take that with, like you look into her freezer, she's got a big freezer like that, and they've got so much frozen foods, and you look into ours, we've got the one the same size, but it's just basically frozen vegetables, so you know. We've got . Everything's frozen basically in our house. Well, she does buy vegetables, but she'd rather buy frozen veg, 'cos it's just easy for her, dead easy for her. Yeah, it is easy, yeah Probably erm, it's probably nicer 'cos it's it's it's frozen straight away after it's been picked, innit? So it's probably fresher. Mm, they say that, don't they about frozen veg. Mm. They say it gives er flavour more. Mm. You know, some people, just don't like buying them, do they? They don't buy frozen vegetables. They'd rather cook it fresh. No, they got They won't like Kerry's house. Yeah. We got to use them up like Yeah? Mm. Well, there used to be a fridge/freezer at the bottom of the stairs. But the freezer kept freezing up, and er, we've had it since we left Sussex anyway. It would be fourteen years old now. Bloody hell. Coming up for fifteen years old. Erm, so like they just took all the fridge Part, Mm. the erm, the bar, the like the dining bar And er, keep the lemons and things in it, and then, the freezer is just for and when there was like a of stuff at Christmas, they put stuff in it from downstairs, Mm. but freezers anyway. And erm, we got a big, er huge chest freezer. Deep freezer, downstairs in the cellar. Do you stock some, at all for yourself? Do you ever use any fridge/freezers. No,fridge/freezer so it's down two flights of stairs. Mm. Mm. I don't know, it's just a pain in the arse. But we've never really eaten that much frozen food anyway. Mum's never had that much stuff in the freezer. When I used to buy stuff from M and S, from the staff shop. We'd stick it in the freezer that we've got downstairs. Mm. But you know, we just don't need frozen 'Cos, yeah, it's just vegetables we keep because erm, or if my mother makes sort of a lot of curries or things. Or or tomato sauce for the pasta, she'll freeze it in indiv individual portions, but Kerry at home like, they've got some real frozen meals, and they do do rely heavily on convenience foods, which we don't really. But you know you were saying that your fridge was fifteen years old, that one. Well, we got at the back of th the erm, shop there's we got this room and it's got this walk-in freezer erm fridge, and Walk-in? Ye yeah it kinda just walk. It literally clogs around. you just walk in and like, it was there and I would have said it was old when we arrived, and we've been there nineteen perhaps twenty years. Bloody hell, and it's still going. It's huge, it's so big. And do you you use it. Yes, used. And you've still got another five fridges. We got a big one where erm, sort of, it's really cold, and so we keep erm, the longest dates and everything erm, that we don't need immediately, and then, we got the fridge/freezer, we got the freezer in the stock-room, which is ours, we we just bought it,wh , my parents bought it about three years ago, for ourselves. Then we got the big fridge in the kitchen for all the foods like we use every day, then we got erm, oh w no, we got six fridges, and then we got the pie fridge, got all the p pies and put the cakes in as well, and we got another deep freeze. We keep the ice-cream and at the pa the pizzas and the ready meals that we cook. Oh, you got quite a variety of foods. Yeah, quite a variety, and then we got the drinks machines. Do you do desserts? Well, apple tart, but you know, things we bring in, apple tarts erm, custard slices,a the occasional eclair erm, yeah, we do quite a range, actually. Mm. Yes, we got six freezers, one, two, three, four, five, six, you know for, it's not that big it's quite a lot, really. Mm. Well, we got a lot of storage space, but, because we get deliveries three days, three times a week, Mm. you know. Don't we don't hold a lot of stuff for any period of time, Yeah. because it's all just coming in and going straight out again. Mm. 'Cos, Like the ice-cream and stuff, I mean, you know, ice-cream a box of ice-cream won't be there more than a week. 'Cos erm like Like their individual portions. So erm, you know, it's there that, although we've got a lot of storage space, Mm. The turn-over of food and the selling of food, you know. I mean, Things obviously, like herbs and stuff Steve only orders once in a blue moon. Yeah. Mm. And and like the dry store, erm, with all, it's got like the rice in it, the custard in it, all those sorts of things, I mean, you know, he might order that stuff once a week, rather than having it come in three days a week. But then, there might be joints of meat and the ice-cream and all the desserts and all the all, I mean, we have had fresh veg, we're not allowed to put peas on the carvery. Mm. Had to have six fresh veg on the carvery Do you? at all times. That's hard going then, isn't it? , that's hard work, you know, you have to prepare all that veg, and And so, if So if So if erm, if they're not used, they've got to be thrown away, they can't be sort of used again the next day, the veg. Well, most veg you couldn't use couldn't use up, could you. No. I don't suppose. I mean, you just have to control it, You don't cook, you don't cook as much as you need, you might have your potatoes prep but you don't cook them if you don't need them. Mm. Erm, you know, if they're sitting there in water and they've been peeled and they're ready to cook, they won't be cooked until they're needed to be cooked, you know. Mm. And erm, oh well, you know, they might have cauliflower cheese prepared to to put out, you know, they might. Say they needed it at eight, they thought they might need it at eight o'clock and then turned out they didn't, because one body else came in the restaurant, then they'd just stick that in the fridge over night, and put it out the next morning. Yeah. But, like if it's been out on the deck, the only things off the deck that they can save, is like Ratatouille, they save that, erm, and like but it's unused Mm. nothing else really. everything else has to be thrown out . 'Cos there's that what were they doing they'd be doing and the bread the bread and milk comes every day and then I think the meat,meat comes once every week, like. My bread I get from Tesco's. Do you? I get from the Co-op next door. Yeah, sometimes Tesco's, sometime. I used to pay this friend to go like into Tesco's. Mm. Sometimes James go up or Dennis goes up. Mm. If not they go to the Co-op, but Tesco's bread is cheaper. Erm, but . I mean, we, we used to have, like, we'd have meat come twice a week, they're the butchers, and then we'd have coming, maybe, erm, once a week, and then like the dry goods, er, erm, we'd have another day, where erm, you know, you have different things, basically coming every day. Mm. and the milkman would come and everything else, and now it's all central distribution, and erm,meat, you know, do central distribution, for the whole thing, and erm, they, all the companies that used to deliver to us individually, they deliver to the central depot,and they, in turn, distribute it to all the houses, Mm. and it's a much better system, overall, which is, you know, you don't have to ring up some many different people every week. Yeah. Mm. Ringing up for one order, so it does work out better now. It's really funny, because, we know our Hello,Bet it's Hi. She's just walked in I had a feeling I knew it would be you. Hi yeah. There's no one else that walks into our house, without ringing the bell. Just goes for it. How are you. Very well, thank you, how are you? We bought you a drink Lovely and sweet Bit disappointed in you. You didn't do very well over the weekend, did you, 'cos I was watching them and they didn't do that well. I know, he didn't really have a good he had a good day in the Mail on Sunday, though. Mm. oh right. I thought as in Italy, yeah. Oh my life. You haven't got your new clothes on. I know I haven't. You got you got them down here. Aye? Have you got them down here? No. I told her to bring them down You haven't even got, you haven't even got your No, sorry. She's got holes in those bloody jean, look at her. I know, sorry. Ar, look at all these apologies she's having to make, you wicked things. I always come round in my jeans. We always give her a hard time. They're so mean to me. What have you lot been up to? Nothing. Just watching the box , And we're just sitting here, talking about food. Mm. Just lazing around, really. How's work going? Really fun. It hasn't been that busy, it's not busy. Isn't it? It's just not like home, at home. Like if I worked at home on Saturday night, and I worked at home on a Sunday lunch-time it would be really, really busy all the time, and like there's four areas to cover in and there's only two areas and I think its too It's so weird though, cos The Rising Sun, it's not as if it's not central, Mm. it's on the way to bloody Richmond, you think it would be busy, wouldn't you? That's weird. Just a small On the main road . When we were in there, that Bank Holiday Monday, it was really busy, wasn't it. Well. Was it really busy, or was the bar service just crap. The bar service is crap. Yeah. There's only one person on Yeah. Erm, I mean, there were people in there, though, No, that's true. you know, I mean, Sunday are below one thousand six hundred quid. Right. That covers me for office work to negotiate to try and settle this case. It covers me for the preparation work to an industrial tribunal. It will not cover me for the hearing. Legal aid is not available in any form for industrial tribunal hearings erm so what I usually say is that we assist the client up to the stage where s it means going er to the tribunal itself. Yeah. And then if er you want a so solicitor with you on that day we'll have to come to some arrangement with you privately about the costs. But today's date even that doesn't apply because you you're category's above the level at which I can give you advice. Yeah but that's only because I er I owe a grand in poll tax you see. Right well as soon as you can come to me and say, I've no longer got that amount Mm. we can you sign you up to one of these green forms. I can't do it today. Mm. Erm er basically I'm going to h have to boot you out because I've got somebody else waiting for me . Right that's fine . Erm you've got to make a decision what to do. Er erm I wo obviously make sure you keep hold of those cos I'll want copi of those if you want me to do anything more for you. Mm. Erm I would suggest that if you are going to contact them yourself about this, that you make sure it's done without prejudice. Put it in writing marked, Without prejudice Mm. erm to your rights to apply to an industrial tribunal. Erm and then y you know you get your cash and three months from twenty second of June to do something about it. Yeah. Right. But you would certainly accept it for now then? Yeah I think you've got a case worth pursuing. Mm. I don't know how strong it is because as I say, erm most contracts of employment do include a provision that if somebody h has a driving licence and loses it and driving is part of their work, even if it's only a minor part of their work, then the employer can erm dismiss. Well what they said to me was But your advantage is you've got no em contract of employment. But wh what they said to me was although erm although it's not a driving is not a major part of and your role was changing and whatever that means And you didn't know that did you? Well plus plus the fact that erm it's not that you haven't got one, or it's not that we'd need you to drive it's that you're denying us the privilege of being able to send you. Mm. Well there is some argument in that, but, you know they should be looking at alternatives somebody to drive you out the sites where they , the whole time they would take you there and bring you back. Mm. It seems to apply doesn't it? Plus that other thing that was at you know that it it stated it's a way of getting rid of him without redundancy. Yeah sure. I mean if you can come up with the witnesses that are prepared to stick their head in the noose and say that. That's going to be your problem because they're all still wor working for the company. Mm. But if you can get somebody to come along and say that then er erm y your case gets a lot stronger. Okay? So I'll leave it with you. It's just that I I'm finding it well I'm not. My wife's getting very upset about it, the whole affair and everything like that Mm. And er I don't know whether to it's it's the money aspect of it because if my unemployment's stopped Well we'll stop I mean at eight weeks, say they stop it by erm Twenty six twenty six, it's these days Or up to twenty six anyway . Er do they should give you income support as opposed to unemployment benefit . Yeah but even that it's it's ridiculously low. Yeah. Erm. In terms of h h what's your objective. Er do you want to go back and work for them, is that the m the main thing so you've got your job back, cos if you claim compensation th the basic award is equivalent to redundancy which it sound as though they may well pay about of half that to you. Erm that's if you prove your case. You'd get a basic award equivalent to what would happen if you were made redundant. On top of that you get compensation which is a maximum of ten thousand pounds and depends on erm whether you've got another job, erm whether you've contributed towards your own dismissal, and I think th the tribunal would knock something off for that. A at a guess I would think they would probably give you about three to six months' worth of pay as compensation, if Mm. you proved your case. Mm. So it's not a vast amount in comparison with having no job. No no but it goes somewhere near half way I mean a question of whether you can go back the the reasoning being that I've gone into the aspects of erm income support and that and basically i it's about seventy pound a week to live on . Yeah, yeah. Now which is upsetting my wife. But in the mean time my wages I've had last week have been spent Mm. I don't know I don't know how long income support's going to be, I don't know how long my next pay packet's gonna be or what have you. The sooner you're on income support again I can sign you up to one of these green forms, so I can give you some advice on that. You can? Yeah. I can then advise you. Well I filled all the forms in and that it's just a matter of delivering . Yeah. Your capital at the moment takes you just over so you know once your capital's below sixteen hundred quid Mm. I can then sign you up to that. Mm. It won't cost you for my advice. Well what I'll do is I'll stick it in my diary for a couple of weeks. Yeah. Would you Y Would you recommend that I got rid of some of it then by paying my poll tax or doing something with it or use the money to live off? It's very difficult to advise you isn't it? I d th the natural inclination is to say use it t to live off because you don't have a problem over the next twenty six weeks. Mm. Mm. And then again if they pay me this money as an ex gratia payment. You have to tell the D S S. Or, I've got to get rid of that as well haven't I? Mm. But I think you've got a case which I I would say is fifty fifty. It's one that we can perhaps put a bit of pressure on if we issue an application for you by getting ACAS involved and seeing whether ACAS can either get you back there or er get you a compensation off them. Yeah. So they'll be in trouble to start with cos they had no contracts of employment out at that time. Yeah. So what do you want me to do for now then? Well you follow up what you want to do with the company when you've thought about what I've said to you Yeah. erm let me know what you do Yeah. erm and then I can put together Contact you within the next fortnight something Yeah. like that? Yeah and I'll put together er a tribunal claim for you. Get it to you for checking. Thanks for your help. Okay. Okay then. Right. Just let me know what you want to do and we'll put it together for you. Okay then. Thanks then. Cheers. Hello It's me again, with this head of mine. What have you been doing to your head now? I've already been up at your You says it was inflammation of the nerves in the Aye. . It's not been away at all. Has it not? No. Let's get it x-rayed Eh. and see what's going on. Let's see I thought it was a . I took it off Doctor, and I I take so mind the wee er nerve pills that you gave me mamma . Mhm. Och, I can't remember, Diazepam, took one of them at , whether it's nerves or what Mhm. I don't know. Ah that's a nerve, that's a nerve getting inflamed up the back there . Well it took the pain away like that. Let's get this thing sorted and see. Aye, your stomach and back . And it had been going, you see me stomach as well. Yeah. I've been burping an awful lot, in my stomach. What's worrying you? Och, I don't know. I haven't the foggiest. Have I feel awfully depressed as well. Right. Whether it's this pain that's doing it I know I don't know. Let's get this head of your x-rayed and see what's going on. I don't know what's causing it. Just not going away, even the tablets that you gave me, they wasn't even taking it away, it, away like . The ? Aye,. I mean for a while I think it was maybe my glasses, but these are just new No. lenses I've got. Now then. I thought the change of life would be starting on me as well. Well this is the other thing that could could be starting. Ah. You're a bit young. Ah but even me ma me mammy she was young and all,she was thirty seven. She was just thirty seven, was she ? Aye. Well When she started to change. Yeah. You're getting near, you're getting near . Ah slowly but surely. Well let's get you something to Can you give me something to do for it Doctor? Aye. I don't like to ask you but me mam asked you me to ask you if you could give her something for to give her some energy, she's sleeping all the time now. Why did you give her sleeping pills? No, she Cannae get awake? She's not been taking them, she's been able to sleep at night but she's sleeping all day and all. Right. Just something for to pep her up a bit. But I I I'm at early in the morning so me mammy says, Why don't you try one of the Diazepam that I've got. I took one and it took it away. Disappeared? Aye. Ah well it's definitely, it's sounds like a, if it's doing it that it sounds like an inflammation on the nerves right enough. Aye, took it away no bother. Mhm. Now that's for your mum. That's my mam. Mrs , so there's no mistake. And that's Mrs . Okay. And now yourself, er Now this is the stuff er very like Valium Aye. and the Diazepam, er but it's nice and gentle it's easier As long as it doesn't make me sleep. No your alright, it won't knock you out, this it the thing, this is the great thing about this. And you take this every day, Every day . one after your cup of tea in the morning Aha. And one after your cup of tea at six o'clock. Right. And you take that over to and get Any time? some x-rays. Aye, any time after er I guess half past nine in the morning. Right. Just give it to the lassie and she'll put you through straight away. Mhm. Get your x-rays done and they'll send the results over to us in a week . To just to out-patients that I go to Aye. Aye. You know the first when you go in. Ah just as you go in it's just er First one on the right Right, aye. hand side. And they'll check that out for you and we'll see what's happening but it's just in case there's any arthritis or anything like that that's Aye. causing it, er or some dry rot setting in. nice. Get it, get it organized, make it Okey-dokey. organized dry rot. Right thanks very much Dr . Right? Okay. Right but get your mum started on that, get her, Get her up and going,. get her going . Right, Many thinks, cheerio. right cheerio now. It's gotten off of me. That good is it? Now. that away. Have you come across anything think ooh we could do with a look at that? Erm no. Oh. Erm Okay. Are you still working through past papers? Not really. I mean she, actually she might have given us . Just been given a new exercise book, textbook. So you've been, you've been back at school since I saw you last, and you've just Yeah. been working on What? Graphs. Graphs. important thing about graphs. Erm. Are they ? If there was an exam question which said sketch a graph of, where would the marks be found? What would you get marks for? The axes. Okay, X and Y. The points Which parti particular points? Points given for like co-ordinates. Erm let's , if they say sketch a graph, Right. I they wouldn't give you any points. Erm directions. Or shape of the line. Okay, general shape. What would be the interesting parts of the shape? Where it crosses through the X and Y axes. Okay, X and Y axes, anything else that might be an interesting point? Erm . Just checking it was on at a reasonable volume. Erm end or anything else that might be interesting . Mm. Where it cross the X and Y erm What's where are the interesting points on that? Er er er there . Okay and these are, these are fairly interesting as well. Just . What's happening in the, near the, the limits? As X becomes a very very very small number, or a large negative number, if you like to think of it that way, where X is very large. So, sketching a graph is not the same as plotting one. Mm. Any idea what that graph would be? X squared. Erm, what would not quite the right shape what would that graph be? Y equals something plus X squared. Right, there'd be some X squared in it. And there might be, it would be something X squared, and there might be something X and er well there's definitely a constant Mm. Yeah. cos when X is zero still there's Y has still got a value. So that's going to be minus something Mm. so it's about minus three. X squared cuts the X axis in two points. Two points. This one Three points. It's So? X cubed. So this is, there's going to be an X cubed term in here somewhere, and there might be X squared and Xs and anything else, but if it cuts it three places, it's got three r three roots. So it's X cubed. What about this one? I have to sketch curves This sort of thing. Just touches. Y equals X squared. Something like, it's going to have an X squared in it somewhere. It's a bit lopsided, but it's Where's the X, where's the Y? It's gonna be about plus three, three plus. Mm. X squared. So it'll be something like X minus three X squared. Mm. if that's three. Just touches. Counts as two coincident roots. Two which are the same. So X equal three or X equal three. Yeah. sort that one out. Erm don't forget these endpoints. If you have something like Y equals X squared plus six What would that look like, going as X goes from minus infinity through zero to plus infinity? What would be the interesting points on that? Erm that'd be six. Y would be six,. Mhm. nought is six. Erm What about when X is about sort of point one. Nought point one. What's Y equal to, roughly? Approximately. Just over six, six point s two. Six and a bit. Erm that's when it's minus nought point one four, or plus nought point one I went through the minus point first. It's still about six, six, six and a bit. What about when X is sort of around infinity? What does it approximate to? Erm minus infinity. So, it's minus infinity or plus infinity. When X is very large or very very small. at minus a million. Erm What would that approximate to? A million plus six. No Do you enter a big competition, and you could win a million pounds plus six. Compared to the million pounds nobody bothers much about the six, so Just a when it gets very large, Y is roughly equal to X squared. So if you know the graph of Y equals X squared which unfortunately I can't draw tonight it's draw it for you, could draw it from the inside keep telling everyone else. Right. Now, there's a Y equals X squared. Yeah. So around here, round this bit,there won't be any difference. Hmm. Around six plus six, let's say plus six in there. For, for some length, that'll be sort of almost flat, won't it? I mean Mm. till we get to X equals a one and it starts making a bit of difference, so it'll probably go like this. Okay, so a lot of it, that's a very important, those are sort of very important parts of the graph. Tend to Mm. get neglected. People say oh I'll take it from minus five to plus five. Right? If we had something like Y equals erm X minus ten. Right. Times X minus erm or times ten minus X like that, okay. Funny way of writing it, but you ca you could write it that way. Ten X. Erm people might say oh well we'll take it from minus five to plus five. Yeah. And you'd get some sort of shape. But you'd miss a lot of important points. Yeah. Erm if they took it from minus ten to plus ten Yeah. you'd see a lot more things of interest and maybe say oh I'll take it from minus fifteen to plus fifteen. But you're still missing out a big, very important part of the graph, because for a lot of its range it actually, you know, looks something like well what would that look like? When X is gigantic. Ten times. If, if X was a million say, you could forget about a million minus ten, let's just call it a million, times ten Ten. minus a million, we'll forget about the ten, just think of the minus a million. So it's a million times minus a million. Roughly. A million times minus a million? Ah. Minus. What's, okay, let's come down a bit. What's plus three times minus three? Three. What's plus three times plus three? Nine. Right. And, minus three times minus three? Minus nine. No. Minus three times minus three? Oh nine. Right. So,. It's a million so one million It's a times minus one million. Is? million times And what is the sign of it though? Minus. It's the same Right. So it's minus a million squared. So wh when X is very big well, say, when it's big compared to ten Yeah. this looks like Y equals minus X squared. Mm. And this part of the graph, in there I mean that wouldn't start showing until we get beyond about say twentyish. At that point, it could be doing all sorts of weird things, and you'd think oh, I've got this wonderful graph and I plotted a lot of points close together, so I know my sketch was right, because it looked like this funny W thing or M or something Mm. erm it might well look like that for that very small piece of graph, but the overall picture you've lost completely by not going far enough so you, you want minus infinity to plus infinity. When you substitute infinity in, just think well if it was about a million, what could we ignore? I mean, you could work all this out right. Ten X plus another ten X. Okay? And then minus a hundred and minus X squared, and put the millions and things in but don't need to. You've got it factorized like this, you could just, oh, that's about a million. It's about minus a million, so it's about minus a million squared. And there'll be marks going for . It's where most people throw it away on the sketches, they just pick a tiny, tiny portion and look at that in great detail, say ah, look at that, wonderful. Mm. But you've lost the, the overall shape of it. Tt, erm plotting graphs, you had one question didn't you where they asked a gradient? Yeah. And you measured it with a protractor, Mm. it was forty five degrees so you thought it was one, but the scale was two to one. Yeah. The gradient is the tan of the angle, but you can only read that off the graph if you've got the same units. Same scale on the X and Y. Erm what would be let's say someone gave you this find an approximation for the gradient erm Y equals X squared minus one. X squared? Y equals X squared minus one, at around the point where X equals three. Someone wanted to know the gradient. So, so Ooh. you d you'd have to find Y. Okay. So Y is three squared minus one. Yeah okay. be Y would equal eight. Yeah. Erm so Good. Right, draw a sketch, cos we need to know what we're working with here. So Y could perhaps equal three. the rest of the graph the opposite point. Right. Good. It's symmetrical down the Y axis. And the lowest point. It'd be about one . About one. What's the graph going to look like here, when X is very big? . X is going to go up when Y is a million. X X is a million. X is a million. What, what would Y be? A million squared. Yeah. So th the minus one doesn't make a lot of difference, so as X is very, when X gets very big, it'll just look like Y equals X squared,taking one off if Mm. you're working with millions of millions. So it looks like Y equals X squared, moved up a bit, more or less, as a good approximation. I mean a hundred is probably big enough, twenty five might be is more or less big enough. Mm. Er five, say we can have five here, you can have twenty five,over here somewhere, Mhm. behind your shoulder. Yeah it'll actually be twenty five minus one, Minus one. but it's a good enough approximation just to see what it'll look like. So how do you work out the gradient? Well you see, it's pretty flattish isn't it? The gradient of a curve is the gradient of tangent, so we can draw a tangent where you wanted it at that place. It would be the gradient of the tangent. Mhm. If it was at the bottom where it's flat, where you just, you're just coming down, and then you started to go up again, just at the bottom there, it's, it's zero for a moment. But what would the gradient be there, and how would we find it? Er It would, it, up here. So could you do an approximation, a ver just a very rough guess. I mean does it, does it lie over that way or has it sort of gone back on itself? Lies over that way? Yeah. Is it more or less straight up? More or less horizontal? About forty five or? It's probably about seventy. Right. Maybe seventy, maybe eighty. So you could draw a rough sketch like that, Mm. just measure it with a protractor, or measure along here. That would be if we drew wh wh how do we find the gradient really? We draw a little triangle, don't we? Yeah. So at point one, it's nought. What would, what would that be at the point two? For X Three. equals two? Two three. So we could get the point two three, and we could take the gradient of that as being fairly close to the gradient of the curve. Mm. Erm how can we get it more accurately reflecting what's happening there? Right. Point something. So if we did something like that that's where we want it. That's where we want the gradient Mhm. and we took a line from there to there, where this is that's where X is equal to, that'll go far. Nought nought point nine say. And just the other side of it, where X equals one point one. Mm. We're going to have, difference along the X axis will be nought point two. Yeah. Find out what the difference, what the, don't forget the difference On the Y axis . on the Y axis. So. That's point two there. So what's, what's the value of Y going to be? When X is nought point nine? Point nine squared, minus one. Okay. We can forget about the minus one because we're going Mm. to take the minus one off again on this one so we've got, the difference is going to be X one squared minus one minus X two minus one is X two squared minus one, minus X one squared minus one. And they're just going to Cancel. cancel out. one. So the difference is going to be one point one squared minus nought point nine squared Point two squared. Is it? Two point two . Can you remember the factors of A plus B times A minus B. A squared minus A B Yeah. A squared minus A B Plus Plus B A. Minus A B plus A B? two A B. No. It's not two A B, it's minus A B and plus A B Plus A B. which cancel each other out. Yeah. Erm Then plus B times A m Minus B squared. minus B squared One point one squared Minus Point nine squared. A squared minus B squared so it'll be, be one point one, plus point nine Minus. times one point one. Minus. Minus? nought point nine. Nought point nine. I mean you could square them on your calculator, it might be easier. give you twice Two times two. nought point two. Nought point two squared would give you what? Point four. Point four. Try it on your calculator. Point nought four. Point nought four which is s very little. Mm. But twice point two, Give you point four. will give you point four. A hundred times as much. Mm. So here we've got This is less than one. squared. squared it gets smaller and smaller. So that's going to be nought point four. Mm. So the gradient at that point is about two. Erm what wh where were we where did I say find the gradient? Where X equal to three? Yeah. Sorry something wrong that. So we'd be, oh, okay, that's good cos you can do it. When X is three? So when X is two point nine, say. Two point nine, and then Y when X one see what Y is down here. It was three point one. Don't forget you can look at this, Y equals X plus one times X minus one, which, when you see it that way tells you where it's going to, where its roots are. Where it's going to cut the axes. Yeah. X So there Y will be two point nine plus times two point nine minus one. Right. Which is three point nine times nought point nine, Okay. But f we can, we can, we can save that to the end because I think that was Aye. confusing probably wasn't it? When we're doing it this way, we can forget about the, with this X, X two is going to be three point one squared Minus one . minus one. This one is going to be two point nine squared, minus one. Yeah. Subtract them that way round. They'll go out. And we've got three point one squared, minus Two point nine squared . Two point nine squared . Mm. Which will come to, if we add them it's six times nought point two. The gradient will be one point two. That's a bit better because a gradient of one is forty five degrees and we s we said it should be more than that. Erm one point two. Find out which ang what angle has a tan of one point two. Tan minus one . One point two. Fifty. Fifty. So you were, you were closer to seventy. You see how hard it is to see just from the graph, from a, from Mm. a sketch, if you plotted it on paper, but this is without plotting it, we're getting it quite accurately. Erm maybe someone says it could be useful for you to try it again, without any help from this page at all. So we've got Y equals X squared, minus one. And we want the gradient at the point where X equals three. But we want to get very very close to it, like only nought point nought one before it and nought point nought one after it. So what value would ? Around the point where X is three. Erm so you'd need nought in the middle. No, I'm not thinking of drawing a sketch at the moment, we've done the sketch on the other page Ah. and we're just thinking of what value are we going to, what would be the value of X point nought one before three? Er two point nine nine. Okay. Two point nine nine would be one of them. Just after three would be? Three point nought one. Right. Right? And in between would be three. Between would be three. Up one that, we'll just take . What will Y be when X is that? Erm two point nine nine squared minus one. Okay. So you'd just write it as, I mean as it's minus one, you can take it off as you go along, but it's, sometimes it'll be a minus six or something, so write it as two point nine nine squared minus one. Erm three squared minus one. Okay. Now subtract when you have to that Y from that one. Okay. It's two point nine nine plus three point Mm. Oh Oh, yeah, don't, don't do it all in your head. Okay. Do the first stage first. Take that expression away from that, and once you're left, what happens to the minus ones? They cancel. Right. So what are you left with? In terms of the squares. Two point nine nine and three point Which one's first? Two point nine nine.. Now we'll just take the That, three point nought one, minus Right, so it's three point nought one squared, Minus the two point nine minus Erm What was the difference in the Xs? Point nought one. Point nought two. Point nought two sorry . So we put that underneath, on the bottom half of the fraction. Okay. That's, that's Now when you've got an A squared minus B squared, you can factorize that I mean you could just do that on your calculator, and do it in one go, but it's quite easy to do it as three point O one. A plus B, times A minus B. Okay? So three point nought one plus two point nine is point nought two. No sorry, is five point six. Is six. And the the top is six. Six. Times. Times three point nought one minus two point nine nine , which is point two. Equals Six point oh two. Now work out what it's equal to. Okay. All over? One point nought two. Right. Do they just cancel out? Right. They do cancel out. Six. Six. So the gradient Six . Wh when you do it to sort of fairly accurately like that, it six. When we did it fairly roughly, it came to one point two? Yeah. Erm six Because, because we didn't do this bit did we? That should have gone I think that was wrong. That should have been six times nought point two over Minu Yeah. Which again comes to six. So, that's more like it. What's the, what angle has a tan of six, then? Now it'll be in the seventy or eighties. Eighty. Eighty? Good. to be fifty. Erm you can do that with any curve. If I gave you sort of X to the seventeen or something, well you could put two values in. And you could bring them fairly close together and say well I can't tell you exactly what the gradient is at that point, but if you draw a tiny little line and take the gradient of that. Mm. That's er that's good enough, that's close enough. That's a very good approximation. Yeah. So gradients are a very important part of, of sketching a curve. Erm you already pointed out some of the important points where the gradient gets to zero. Erm does, does things that might be interesting? Okay. You've already mentioned it earlier, actually, symmetry. Not always symmetrical about this axis. They might be symmetrical about here or here. Or it this way round. What's that? What's that? That's a . Erm Well I mean what gives you that? What gives you that? Well, what does that look like from the way you're looking at it? s The way you're looking at it, it looks something like erm Y equals X to X the fourth plus three or something. Mm. Good. So looking at it this way up I mean it's X equals Y to the fourth plus three and that's all minus. Mm. X X equals three minus Y to the fourth. It's a funny way of putting it. Yeah. But you could write your equation that way. Er if someone says that's not good enough, I want it in terms of Y equals well okay we'll have to bring the three over to this side, and take the fourth root,. But you can always swap the axes, if you don't like what they give you. Mm. So if, if I say draw erm Y equals the square root of X, and you think I haven't got a clue what that looks like. You can square both sides. You can draw Y squared equals X, and all you have to do is say well, I can draw the other way round. Mm. Y equals X squared. You draw your Y equals X squared,turn the paper round that way, and whichever way, I'm going to draw Y equals X squared. And erm Y equals X squared, and that's Y and that's an X. Then turn it the other way up to get X equals Y squared, and now that's the Y and this is the X. And this is a, should have drawn it that way round, Mm. to get the, the X squared, this would be the minus X squared. Mm. X squared look like that. Y squared equals X. Yeah. Erm you don't have to do that very often, but it is sometimes, it fits. It's handy. Rather than doing it the other way. What, what have you been doing with graphs at school? Erm Sketching and plotting? there's the revision . . Have you done every one? Every question twice three times? Four, even. Oh, that's too many. No actually, Oh you'll have to Oh I'm sorry, I'll go back to three . you'll have to do them all you'll have to undo Do them or something. That's it. Do them all backwards, yes. I haven't got it with me. Mhm. Yeah. Okay. So you've been sketching them? Yeah. And plotting them? Mm. Have you been erm Speed-type graphs. Mhm. Good. Aha, have you been asked, erm what is this? Here's a graph, now guess the equation? No. No. Okay. You don't really need to, but it's, there usually isn't time to cover it, cos you've got other things, but it gives you a much better feel for it if you, if you see the other side of the picture all the time. That you're not just in isolation, looking at one little thing, because you can miss a lot. Erm you might think that all graphs always look like that, or bits of graphs are always like that, or where does it all tie in? Distance time graphs. One of those on every exam so far. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Are you happy with those? Er I think so yeah.. Okay. What's, what's happening here then? This is a good way We do them in physics. Oh lovely. Thanks very much. Okay. I Right, that's erm as time goes on along there, Mhm. this is displacement, which is the distance from a fixed position. come from that way. bit of negative time in there. What's happening there then? Well it's speeding up to there accelerating and it's Mhm. It's speeding up again. What's happened? That's, that's, that's a, that's a straight line, and you say it's speeding up? That seems to imply that, I don't think it's speeding up,doesn't it ? Yeah. Erm So the gradient there, is S over T, how far you've travelled. Let's say these, let's say we mark this off in one second intervals along here. If I got the intervals right they'd be the same. So every one second, it's gone another ten metres or so. Yeah. Gradient is the same all the time. Ah, so it's just steady Fixed constant speed, constant speed. How about have a bit so that bit Erm don't know. Mm. S I'd say that's ten metres or something. Where are you after one second? Ten metres. Ten metres. Where are you after two m ? Ten metres. Mm. It's not moving. Mm. As time goes on, its distance stays the same. Now it looks like, ah just stopped moving again, straight line, fixed speed that, this looks as if it's accelerating. It's very, it's deceptive if you're not working out what you're doing and relating it back to the graph, and relating it back to physics, to an experiment you're doing, someone's checking the clock every second to see how much further it's gone. Oh well, in the last second it went another ten metres. Last second it went another ten metres. It's going at a steady speed. Fixed constant velocity. But here, that's still where it was last time I checked my watch. Yeah. Not moving. So that's a steady speed. And it stops. That's, it changes abruptly. From a steady speed. It doesn't need to brake or does it just? Mm. If it's a physical body, to change speed, it'll have to have to brake. And the s what would, so, that's a fixed speed. There's another str another straight line . There's another straight line, another fixed speed. Which one is faster? Every one second,ten metres. Every second that's going more than ten metres Right. So that So the steeper it is? The faster. The faster it's going. So at this point, it's almost flat. So it's going very slowly. Now what's happening to its speed? Accelerating. Yeah. The speed is increasing. Sort of Stop. sort of actually stops, and then it's going very slowly again for a bit, and then what happens here? very, it just goes very fast Right. in a very short space of time then, but then carries on. Very short space of time it's gone quite a distance. So that was a, that is at, that constant speed there is much faster than, than this one. And then, it's stationary It's for a while. And then Just goes down there. What's happening here? Deceleration. Well let's make, let's make this bit a straight line, from there to about there. That's a straight line. So, well let's go back to the physics. We've just been going on timing it for one minute or something. And we time it again, one minute and one second It's reversed. It's reversed. How far away was it when I started the watch? Thirty metres away. How, how far is it after another one second? Twenty metres away. Ah. Ah! It's coming back. Okay. So that's going backwards. Most graphs will keep going on up, and there's a tendency for people to make them come back down again Mm. or at least to where they started. That means it's going backwards. Erm now you don't do, paper three, you don't do velocity time graphs, but you probably do them in physics don't you? You would do them in physics. It's just like pure coincidence. Aha! Oh that's a good one that. Revising it yesterday to be honest. That's a good one. got all pictures in it. Yes it has, but these are, those are, I've seen those before and they are very nice graphs, I would recommend them to anyone. Right. So, you were revising them yesterday. Should I Well the big thing, ah. See, it's very easy to get confused between distance against time, speed against time, and even acceleration against time. Yeah, because I mean it had them in our exam, Right. in our mock, we had like those four pictures, and you had to say which was It comes up time and time again, and you have to know the difference between the different types. So you also, when you get used to each type individually, need to then be able to switch between Mm. between one and the other. Yeah. So if we've got erm acceleration against time and we get, no, no peeping. No peeping. We get a flat one, what does that mean? It's Every one second, you've gone further. We haven't gone anywhere we've measured the acceleration. The acceleration there is say forwards. One two And for every one second, you're going forty metres per second. So you're going at a steady speed. Per second. It's, it's a, it's an acceleration, it's metres second to the minus two. Now are you happy with that, because most people aren't? Okay. We'll come back to that in a minute, but let's say a rocket, or a car, which would you prefer that do? Car. Car. Constant acceleration car. Erm no frictional resis resistance, you just put your foot down and it's, you know where a car accelerates from rest Mm. and then after a while the acceleration reduces? The speed is still going up, the acceleration, and eventually it reaches a top speed and it stays there. Mm. Okay, it's zero acceleration, it's not getting any faster. Mm. Erm how would we measure that? A constant acceleration. Say we had an accelerometer. An acceleration measurer. Mm. Which force on a weight or something can feel acceleration, I think you can, my son said you can't but I think you can So, acceleration is a constant. What's your eventual top speed? It just, just keeps going faster and faster and faster and faster Infinity. Infinity, speed of light, when you hit something. It's pretty high. Mm. Erm now how are we going to measure acceleration? Let's say we've got erm a radar for, for measuring speed Mm. velocity. Okay. And we'll set up a, so we're going to, you, you devise an experiment, Neil. Measure acceleration. There's a car, and we want to know its acceleration between two points. doesn't matter. There's your car. Erm you start the stopwatch. Er stopwatch you m you time it from there to the ten metre. Erm what's along your X axis? Your independent variable? Time. Time. So, when would you next check its acceleration? Would you measure in terms of distance or in, in terms of other time Time. Ten seconds. Ten seconds. We'll make it one second. Okay. Make it one second. Alright, make it ten. Sorry,, make it ten seconds. Plus one second. Then the you have to have y how far the car has travelled, Do you? know how quickly. What is acceleration? Give me a figure, that you might have seen in an advert, when you're drooling over BMWs and things, Maseratis. Miles per hour. Telling you about its acceleration. What does it say? Goes from nought to sixty. Good. In? Six seconds. Six seconds. Nought to sixty in six seconds. So those are the units of acceleration. From one speed to another speed, In however qu in so, so much time. So let let's say, instead of quoting from nought, they said well a much more useful figure is perhaps, which they do quote in lots of these car magazines, is erm forty to sixty Mm. because that's what you need for overtaking someone. You can go from forty to sixty in point three seconds or something, you can really shoot past anything on the road. So forty to sixty, miles per hour, metres per second, whatever you like, let's say metres per second. Let's say it goes from forty to si forty metres per second to sixty metres per second in ten seconds. More of a slug, this car. So what would that acceleration be? How w what would the units of acceleration be? Twenty metres per second per second. Twenty metres per second, per second. Per second. It's simpler to say per second per second . It's Or per second squared, or second to the minus two. What is this rubbish, it doesn't, doesn't, cannot possibly mean anything real. Mm. Well, it is real. It's erm fifty miles per hour per hour. Yeah. Right well we'd normally say, miles per hour per second. What's, what's your acceleration at the moment? Well it's ten miles per hour per second. Okay? Well every second, I'm going I'm going ten miles an hour faster. So miles per hour per second, or you could measure it per hour if you wanted. Every hour, I'm going six hundred miles an hour faster So so it's miles per hour per hour. you'd need a stopwatch and a speedometer. You'd need a something to, I say, we've got something to measure the speed, radar gun, Mm. not interested in the distance, just the velocity, the speed. How fast is that car going now? Okay, he's doing forty miles an hour. Measure him again in one second's time He's doing sixty. he's doing sixty miles an hour, so his acceleration was twenty miles per hour per second. Per second. Twenty miles per hour per second,miles per hour, what's the change this miles per hour into metres per second. Okay, so,say a hundred and twenty metres per second per second. And that's where your per second per second comes in. Are you a bit happier with that? Yeah. But not totally convinced. No . Erm that length per time per time, is the unit. Let's just have a little look. What are the units of displacement? Er What's the difference between displacement and distance? Displacement is how fast it's going, the speed. Miles per hour. Show me something that is erm arm's length away from, from your right shoulder. Okay, show me something else that's an arm's length from That's your right shoulder isn't it. Arm's length . I was expecting you to go like this. Right, okay, that, show me something else that's arm's length from your right shoulder. Right. Up there Right. That's distance. Mm. Displacement is distance in a specified direction. So if I said show me something that's arm's length from your right shoulder north, or up, or west or some way, okay, or on a bearing of thirty seven degrees Yeah. that's displacement. We don't usually tend to bother with distance much, so when, when the police measure your speed, they're actually measuring My dad's your my dad's speed. your dad's speed. Not mine. You don't drive? No, no, no. Yeah, of course. Can't be my speed. Not unless I'm on me bi on my bike, and I doubt if they'd measure me . you, you did eighty on your, on your bike did you? Over, over fifty on a pushbike. Do you know Bo ? Yeah. You know Ben Lech?hill, red hill going down to ? I was young and foolish at the time, Fifty miles an hour on a bike ? Very, very high gear on it, we used to go out a couple of us And er we were passing this M You've got this on tape remember? Oh no! We went past this bloke in a Morris Minor, a convertible, with a eyes streaming, it was really hard to see, and clocked his speed at fifty, and er the bloke behind me nearly got hit,because when I went past this bloke I went all over the road. No you didn't really though did you? Ooh no. No, no you didn't. No officer I didn't. Distance okay? Yeah. And displacement. When they measure your speed, they're measuring your velocity really, they're measuring it in a particular direction, along that road. Mm. Erm so we'll call it distance, right? But we're actually talking about displacement, just so that you feel more comfortable with it, cos there are other things coming up to make you feel less comfortable you see. Okay. So the police say you were doing forty miles an hour. You say how do you know I was doing forty miles an hour? I wasn't driving for an hour, you weren't following me for either an hour or forty miles. They say, ah well, we followed you for a tenth of a mile, right, and it took you so long to cover that. And we, our little machine here has calculated it that that's forty miles an hour. Yeah. Okay, so what did they do? They had your hundred a hundredth of a mile say, let's say it's erm let's say it was a tenth of a mile. Nought point one miles. And they divided that by erm nought point O hours. Mhm. Right? And they said you did point one mile in point O O one hours Hours. so what speed is that? Er Have a guess at it then check it on your calculator. Point one divided by point zero one . Will the two first cancel out? Do they? No. If I gave you this tenth, hundredth, thousandth okay? What would you do? Run. that's hours. Are those? That one and that one cancel. It would cancel out. So you've got one over one hundredth. So that's a bit tricky that, doing it that way, you've got one over one hundredth . The, the easy way, do you like fractions on the bottom of fractions? No. Oh, times by ah. What are you going to times it by? Times that by ten over one. No, times that by a thousand over one. Times that by a thousand. Okay, and you've done, you've done that on one bit of the fraction, so you must do it on the top as well. Times that by a thou aargh. You've got to times that by a thousand. Okay? Multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by the same Mm. thing. So why did you multiply that by a thousand over one? To get that a thousand times a tenth. So doing a hundred miles an hour. Well,for a hundred miles or an hour , but you did a tenth of a mile in a, a thousandth of an hour. Yeah. So, you did so many miles per hour, we calculated, you would have done so many miles if you'd been going for a full hour at that speed, so your dis your, your speed, velocity really but we'll call it speed, right? Your speed was so many miles per hour. okay. And then they measure your acceleration. Well, when we first clocked you, you were doing a hundred miles per hour. Yeah. One hour later, Yeah. you were doing five hundred mile an hour . It's you on your bike isn't it? It is . Shh! I'm sorry. You're not on your bike. I don't mind I don't mind confessing b up to fifty, but five hundred mile an hour, even in a, in a foreign country, like Wales it's a bit much. Okay. So, you went, you gained four hundred miles an hour In one hour. per hour. You're accelerating at a rate of four hundred miles per hour per hour. Per hour. Mm. Mm. So that means in another hour, you'll be going nine hundred? I in another hour, I'd be doing four hundred more than that, so nine hundred. Or, I mean this is if it's an average, and sort of an even acceleration. So before you were doing minus three hundred mile an hour. Yes. Bet you didn't expect to minus, did you? I, I, I haven't recovered from that yet. Yeah I know. Negative speed. Yeah. You're reversing at minus three hundred miles an So acceleration is rate of change of velocity, Mm. which is something like speed, only it's a bit it's got a direction. Velocity's given a direction. Yeah. Right. And velocity is rate of change of displacement. Which is sort of distance, but with a direction. The direction that velocity has got comes from measuring the distance, the displacement, in the direction. Right? So if we say he went from, let's, here's, here's a map. And there's north. Mhm. Right. And let's say he went from there to there. A distance of two miles in one hour, this time we're walking. Mm. Let's make it half an hour, okay? Then Speeded up . his displacement Is two mil the amount he walked was, his displacement was two miles south. The distance he walked was two miles. But the displacement, how far is he from where he started? He displaced himself by two miles south. Two miles south. Okay. So his velocity, Yeah. if he did that in half an hour, what would his velocity be? It's just speed given direction, so two miles Two miles per two miles south, in half an hour. Two miles per, one mile per hour, Mhm. per Mhm. Is it? If he did two miles in half an hour, how far would he go in one hour? Four mile. Right. So it's four miles per hour per hour. Per, no, well Per we're just talking about this velocity stuff, Oh, so it's four miles per hour. South. South. So you have to put the south? Four miles er hour sou If it's a velocity. If it's a velocity. They won't bother with it on G C S E maths, but physics they want to know the difference between velocity and acceleration. So, if he was going, if he, he's walking and he breaks into, a breaks into a trot, A Trot? Gallop. A canter to start with let's say. Oh no, that's horse racing. I I don't want to talk about that. My horse won. A National oh! Ooh. My horse won. Ooh. Oh dear . And did you have a lot on it? Twenty er Twenty million? Twenty pounds was going on it. It was just in the sweep. Oh. Sixty to one outsider, and I thought oh well, I don't stand a chance on it. And it won. Is, it was my sweep that I was doing so I'm keeping the money, nobody else can have it. Since my horse won. Well there was, did you hear about the woman in Ireland who won about a hundred and fifty thousand? Did you hear that? No. Oh, she drew, she was the only one who didn't draw a horse on the National, Mm. I think it were the Irish Times or something, or the Irish Betting Times or something like that, and she was the only one who didn't draw a horse, and she thought oh well that's it, no chance. And they, they, sort of the panel met, and they decided to give it to her, because hers was the nearest to a result. What? The other people who'd drawn a horse, Yeah. well their horse This is a sweep? Yeah. . Yeah, this was it was some form of competition, I didn't hear what Yeah. it was, I just caught the tail end of it on the news, on the Yeah. radio. And erm, but they decided that as she hadn't drawn a horse in the National, she'd got the n she was the nearest to a winner that they could Aha. find, because all the other who had drawn a horse they, they were void. Yeah. So she won . And she'd already decided, no chance I didn't draw a horse. Cos she didn't draw a horse she won, yeah. cos she didn't she won. Mm. Did you put a bet on? Did I? I didn't. You're a mathematician. I I often, well, usually, if I'm in the country at the time I bet on the National just for a, for a to sort of waste some money. But you've got to check out the odds . I l I do check out the odds , Yeah I thought you might do. and erm I only put place bets on. Last year I had a place bet on the winner, I couldn't even tell you what it was now. But I didn't bet it to, I didn't back it to win, I only backed it to come in Each way. the first four. Not each way, just place. Yeah. Just er wh when you put an, when you put an each way bet, you put two bets on at the same time. Mm. One bet says that horse will be first. The other bet says that horse will be in the first three. Or if there are a lot of runners, that horse will be in the first four. Mm. Now when you're, my grandfather, who was a serious betting man, always used to tell me, he was pretty good at it actually, he'd say no good each way bet. Betting against yourself is an each way bet, you're just giving money to the bookie . I thought well you give money to the bookie anyway, but Yeah. so erm I just put a place bet on. And put it on, they used to give me tote odds, sometimes I asked for them, usually they'll automatically give me tote odds. Sometimes I've asked for them. Now the odds on the tote, I mean if you looked at the, I didn't bet on the National, cos I didn't like the odds. Mhm. There was a race just before the National, might have been the one before, or the one before. But something like erm a five or six horse race. And they had seven to one, there was eight to one, there was a ten to one, Mhm. National, a forty horse race more or less isn't it, thirty Mm. nine or something, Thirty nine,. thirty nine horse race, anything can happen. Yeah. Absolutely anything can happen in the National, as, as was yeah. proved this year. Mm. And they spread debris quite some considerable distances. Okay? So whenever you're er tt using er these type of things do be careful. I mean if I was to s stand here and tell you that self-raising flour is classed as an X one, as a class one explosive dust your wife would never make any, an apple pie again in her life. But I'm not gonna tell you that. Okay? But it is and that's why in flour mills they have blast suppression built in and everything else. But the reason being that er flour and stuff is a class one dust is because if you imagine a granule of flour. It's surrounded by a large volume of air isn't it? And the flame propagation is so rapid it's consumed that it just blows. Okay? So that's why, again, you have to be careful with most of our domestic er things that we have er in our homes. Again poor servicing of electric appliances. If you have electrical appliances I know it's gonna cost you a few pence, or probably even a few pounds these days, do make sure that your electrical appliances are serviced properly and correctly. Then you should be reasonably safe. Gas central heating boilers, if the ignition doesn't ignite fast enough you get a build up and that can go with an interesting bang. Yes it can. Yes it can. So everything we've got in our home, the old gas central heating and that's why very often there's a reminder in your annual winter's er bill that you get. The one that's the biggest one of the year they will say when's the last time you had your er gas boiler serviced? Is it ready for doing? Would you like to take effectively a three star, four star, one star er servicing? Okay? I think it's well wor er well worth your while taking er note of these things. Okay? Let's have a look on a little bit then. Danger from fire in the home, the facts. Approximately there are a least sixty thousand fires a year. Approximately seven hundred deaths a year. Seven thousand injuries and many of these could be avoided if we will only take reasonable and proper precautions that we should do. Take advice, if you've got any doubt each old time fire station ha in this county, has a fire safety division attached to it and there are usually two officers on duty, okay? Unless they're out carrying out their inspections but at least the administrator's there, she will help all she possibly can in the absence of the fire safety officer. If you've got any doubts get in touch with your local fire safety officer and he will come along and er waylay any problems that you may have and he will indeed er give you the best of advice that's available. Okay? Are they facts for Nottinghamshire? Those are for Nottinghamshire, yeah. Yeah. If you're from Derbyshire or Leicestershire then in your local telephone directory er do you mean the fire or these numbers? Those numbers. No these numbers are basically nationally at the moment. But unfortunately it's on the increase Mm. and as we are all aware I, I feel sure for there being in the you've been, in that it is unlawful to leave a child alone in the house under the age of twelve years. Cos if anything happens to that child especially in a fire situation you are liable to criminal er tt etcetera. Ah in fact there's a case in London where they've just recently charged a mother, where the firemen were called to a house fire over the weekend and erm during the, putting the fire out they discovered a child's body er i on the settee. Er apparently she was a four year old er they searched for the mother, they found the mother and I understand now that the mother's been charged with murder. So whether she'd committed the act before and er tried to cover it up I don't know, cos obviously it's subject to sub judice at the moment until they've got the, everything in the outcome. But that's the latest thing I've heard of on the one anyway. Yeah. How can we protect our homes then? Okay. We've gone along to lengths of making sure that all our electrical appliances are in good working order. We switch everything off at night that's reasonable to switch off, obviously we're leaving the fridge and freezer on and the electric clock working. Okay. We close all the doors at night. What else can do to protect our homes? What should we be thinking of doing? Smoke alarms. Smoke alarm. How many of you got smoke alarms? Quite a few of you. Good. Okay? And we should also have a fire escape plan. Okay? Just to s talk a little bit on the smoke alarms and then we'll go into the video cos I I'm mindful of the time. Okay? Heat, two types of smoke detector you get in the home, heat and smoke. Okay? Heat reacting increase in temperatures and smoke reacts to smoke and fumes. Okay? Domestic smoke alarms are basically two types. The ionization type and in this in the centre of the core of the er detector is er a small chamber and any particle or substance getting in that chamber is ionized by a small radioactive source. Okay? But don't worry about the radioactive source it's not gonna do you any harm whatsoever. You're not going to suddenly turn green and walk about like that you know. Okay? It ionizes, causes the current to be completed and then that sets off the alarm. Okay? And the optical type it contains this photoelectric cell which triggers alarm when the beam is disturbed by smoke particles. So very often you'll see it on these erm infra red things in er burglar alarm systems. Where you can see a little red light, neon, going in one corner and a reflecting light in the opposite corner. And anything that goes in between those disturbs the beam and it causes an electric current to sound the alarm and it's the same thing that happens with the er detectors. Okay? What's the reaction factor? Well let's, just let's have a little look. Okay? The ionaz ionization detector, often a little bit quicker to react to a hot blazing type of fire such as your chip pan. Okay? The optical detector ideal to react to smouldering type of fire,a example, a cigarette fallen down the side of the er sofa. Some detectors incorporate the two types in a single unit to give you a better performance. Okay? But they are both apt in th they'll do and they'll both do the job. So don't start getting yourself worried well, have I got an ionization or have I got an op an optical one. The only thing you have to bear in mind is that if you have a smoke detector that conforms to the British Standard kite-mark, British Standard five four five part one, that'll be quite sufficient. But what should we do to ensure that our smoke detector is working properly? Test it. Test it. Yeah. Test it on a weekly basis. Okay? But what also should be do? Cook fish. Cook fish. Yes. Yes. Or grill them. that goes off when we Yes. cook fish. Always. Yeah Yeah. Will do. Yeah. Mine always goes off whenever I'm grilling anything at all. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yes. You will find they are very very susceptible and that's the object of the exercise. That's why they are so keen. And that's why in, in buildings, industrial and commercial buildings where we put heat and smoke detectors in for the protection of life and that's why you put it in your homes. Erm it is because they are so acute, the least little whiff and they're away. Okay? You must also remember, ladies and gentlemen, to change the battery at least once a year. Or especially when you start getting the low pip pip pip about every thirty seconds. Okay? Or be aware that the pips could happen when Is it on, on you're on holiday. Pardon? Or be aware that the pips in our case happened when we were on holiday. Yes. Mm. Mm. It cold doesn't it? Can trigger them off. This Mm. has happened to us several times. been away at Yeah. Sometimes can get a cold winter, in the winter. Yeah. and we've come back or in fact Yeah. our son had been in to check the house Yeah. and the thing was going so taken the battery out. Yeah. And he thought the battery you know was running down but in fact it wasn't Mm. it, it's the cold. Yeah. Sometimes But you can get those a little bit offset with temperature. Yeah. That will affect them b This happens every time doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes you will get a er a little bit offset with temperature but it's only a minute thing. I'd rather have that than nothing at Yeah. all. Yeah. It's cold that's affecting the battery. Yeah. And if it and if, if instead of putting the ordinary zinc and, and carbon battery in you put a NiCad battery in, it'll stop it doing that. Okay? So Right. try that. Expert advice there. Okay? Right. The other thing is ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you know or not, but it is now, if you're having a new home built, fresh build as we call it, okay? But it's now, in order to comply with the building regulations nineteen ninety two, it is mandatory for you to have an electrically operated smoke detection system in your home. So if you are thinking, cos you are now finishing work and you're going to retire somewhere nice. Okay? In this country anyway at least, in the U K and you're having a new dream cottage built, okay, to your needs and satisfaction, okay? Please remember that in order to conform to the current building regulations it is now mandatory to have a proper er electrically mains operated smoke alarm system installed in the home. Otherwise the tt building will have deemed to not comply to B one of the building regulations which I don't want to go into too much detail but basically what it is that with effect from nineteen ninety one the smoke alarm smoke detector bill came into er operation and it was brought in into the nineteen ninety two building regulations when they were amended from the nineteen eighty five regulations that states now any new build homes shall have and be fitted with a mains operated, with battery backup, smoke detection system . And in fact in some parts of the country there have been experiments tested with having sprinkler system fitted into the home. How long do Okay? the batteries last if the mains are off while you're away? About er twenty four to thirty six hours. Because part of the condition of your insurance policy in some cases, if you're away more than X number of days, the mains should be switched off. Yeah. Yeah. That's something obviously You go abroad for Yeah You'd a month. you'd take with your insurance company to make sure you were still covered if anything untoward happened while, you know. But er normally your battery on a mains system will last forty eight t thirty six to forty eight hours. That's thirty six to Yeah. forty eight hours worth of noise? No. It's thirty six to forty eight hours of standby Cover. cover. So if your mains goes off through an electrical storm or something like that or your power is cut off because the E the M E B is digging the road up down and they say that your electric will be off for the next Yeah. X number of hours then your battery will take over and it will operate the fire al your domestic system for a period of thirty six to forty eight hours. What about the batteries in a battery operated one then? How long do they last? Well in the normal battery operated one they For years. they're not affected at all. They wi they will last at least twelve months. Ah. Yeah. It does seem self-defeating if one authority requires you to have a mains operated system and another authority says turn off electricity if you're going away. And the gas and the water. Well Yeah. Well yes. What it is le let's just sort of get things, as I say in a new build situation if you were having a new house built the building authority anywhere in the U K, even in Scotland and Northern Ireland, will require you to have a built in smoke detector system, mains with battery. Obviously once a building has been built and you've got that in it's under you then to maintain it. Okay? If you are going away on holiday like I go away on holiday and probably some your colleagues and you're going abroad for two three weeks, it makes commonsense to try and protect your home as soon as you possibly, as much as you can by isolating the risk. So the first thing you do is turn off your gas. You turn off your water and you turn off your electric. Because there's nobody going to, unless you've got somebody watching your house, unless you get a, an enforced entry or, or unlawful entry into your home, nothing's gonna happen because you know alright you've left, you've your fridge and freezer switched on. Okay? So you've got to have your mains for your fridge-freezer haven't you? Basically? Mm. So you're gonna leave your, your mains on anyway for fridge-freezer. So there's no great problem really. Providing you're, you are correctly fused and your wires are okay then no problem. I I can't see er you're gonna have any particular problem with your insurance company cos you've got to leave your fridge-freezer switched on haven't you? Mm. Otherwise when you come back from a month in Malaya or Singapore or wherever you've been you know or Matlock whichever takes your fancy, you're gonna have a right mess in your kitchen aren't you? Yeah. So if I were you I would just have a word with your insurance company and make sure that everything's okay but you're obviously, they must know that you've got to leave your er fridge-freezer switched on, so you've got to have your mains electrics on. Okay? Are you alright on that? Or have you got a I wouldn't trust anything this government does so Well it's not, it's not the government that's doing it anyway. It's the Yeah. Okay? Any questions ladies and gentlemen? Before we se now hopefully it should bring us to about four o'clock. Now this video although it's American based, ignore that fact that they've got tower block apartments, and that'll mean we've got high-rise buildings i in the city of Nottingham and places like that. Okay? But try and look at the fundamental basis of what they're trying to put over to you on the video, okay? That's the main thing and then if you've got any questions afterwards hopefully we'll still have time to go through a few questions. Okay? It is essential that we plan to get out alive, ladies and gentlemen. Okay? So if you have a if you live in er er a two-storey house, okay? Make sure that all r eve even if you're in a bungalow, make sure that all your doors are closed at night, okay? Get everybody, preferably, into the front of the house in the bedroom upstairs, get some clothing or some packing, bedding at the base of the door to stop the smoke filtering through the bottom of the door Okay? Go to the window shout and make it, make your plight known to your neighbours because normally there's somebody passing, policeman on his beat or somebody who'll make your plight known. Okay? If it becomes necessary the Testing, testing. Okay right, so what we've been looking at this week is trade in agricultural commodities, and er, possibly a little bit of GATT as well. And I believe Bob has asked you to er, I think, collect some data erm, on trade in wheat and cotton erm, as an example. We'll come on to that a bit later on. But can you just give me, sort of, a brief overview of what's happened to the composition of world trade right, say over the last hundred years or so. What have been the main features? Well the er, proportion agricultural trade has decreased. Right, correct, okay, erm what absolute, the absolute values of trade. So the relative share of agricultural trade has declined, the relative share of manufacturing trade has increased. How about in absolute terms? It's increased. Yes, that's right. All trade has increased. Why, why has trade in all commodities, agricultural or non-agricultural increased? Better transport links. Okay, how does that affect trade? Well it's easier to transport things overseas or wherever. Also storage is easier, improving Right, super, anything else? Population growth. Yes, populations have, have increased. Technology. Yep, I mean that might in a sense Yes, we're gonna get Transport technology has er, certainly er, certainly improved. Right, okay, so, in ge in general, we can say that world trade has risen over time due to essentially, well, is that, is there anything else that? more countries have er, a big surplus, and more countries having a big deficit in food supply Yes so therefore so that says something about specialization of production possibly, that countries are now more highly specialized than they once were. Yep, I mean, that in a way is a function of, leagues with which international trade can be conducted. You know, if you, if international trade is very difficult as it was, say two hundred years ago, then you've got to be self sufficient. Whereas, erm, you can now exploit individual countries comparative advantage of this trade erm, is, is rel is relatively er, is relatively easy. Are there any other factors, that might have increased, for an incre might have led to an increase in world trade? Rising population, improving transport and technologies. I know this might sound obscure, but erm, I read somewhere when that erm, if you actually bring in protectionism, it sounds like it could actually increase trade. If you bring in protectionism? Don't know how it worked, as in As of, liberalize, or if you increase No, if you actually, you know, if you have a little protectionism, it does actually lead to an increase in trade, but I don't know how that works. Neither do I. No it doesn't, you know it doesn't. I really didn't expect Right, okay, let's say that's a new one on me. Okay. Well, we'll come onto protectionism in er, in a minute. What other factors, there's a big, this fact that we're missing, alright, rising population, improvements in transport and technology, what else has happened over the last hundred years? Increased consumption. Yes, that's right, or right Income. Yes, income, that's right, incomes have risen, er, and as a result we're consuming more goods, consuming more goods it, it followed, well not automatically, but there's a likelihood that trade will also, will also rise. Okay, so, that's, they're the reasons to account for the rise in absolute values of er, trade in all commodities, what about erm, why has the er, trade in manufactures er, increased as a proportion of total trade? I mean, it's not divorced from the things that we've just been talking about Well, cos incomes have risen so, there's more consumption Okay. Specialization as well, er Good right okay, I mean, what income elasticities of demand for Higher for manufactured goods, or high relative to agricultural goods Okay, so, because income elasticities of demand are generally high for manufactured goods as the world economy gets richer, it will want to consume proportionately more of those. Right, now, we could all become self sufficient, alright. But why don't we be become more self sufficient? You know, we can produc we could consume a lot more manufactured goods, but that doesn't necessarily mean that trade will rise. It's likely that trade will rise, but it doesn't automatically follow. What's also happened to trade in manufactures? It's specialized That's right, okay. to, well, produce constant Yes, that's right, you've got because the, the market for er, any one say manufactured goods, in theory could be a, a world market now because there are relatively cheap methods of transporting this er, this particular good. What's happened is because the potential market has risen, firms have specialized. Alright, and this is why we get, erm, cars are an excellent example of this erm. You know, Toyota, Toyota's plant down the road in Derby, massive investment, erm, a huge production capacity. That makes all the Toyota Corollas, or whatever, not only for the U K, or for Europe, but for all, all, all sales of car throughout, of that particular type of car, throughout the world. You know, and even in erm, Japan, they're importing the, the products that are made, made over in Derby. Why're they doing that? It's because manufacturing production erm, or this great scope in manufacturing production for economies of scale. Alright, this is why countries have specialized more, because countries specialize more and consumers want to demand,want to consume erm, higher quantities of er, manufactured goods. Alright. Trade automatically follows therefore. Right, we need the specialization and er, the sort of demand elasticity erm, in that argument to suggest that world tra to explain why world trade has risen. What else, before we come on to agricultural products,what, are there any other notable features of trade in manufactures? Alright, it has risen, right, risen very dramatically erm well, let's try and rephrase this, erm, what's another major reason for the growth of manufacturing trade? Manufacturing trade is, seems to have grown very rapidly, not only because we're producing erm, or con consuming more of a, a particular commodity, but also because consumers like Opportunities in taste. Changes in taste, yes consumers like Consumers like to have variety. yes, consumers want more, more variety, as well as just more, more consumption, and this is why, you know, although we produce cars just about in, in the U K, we still import a lot of cars to the U K. What's that, what's the process of erm, simultaneous import and export of the same commodity, what's that called? Erm, intra, intra-industry trade. Yes, intra-industry trade. And that's the simultaneous import and export of essentially similar products. Alright, now, they're not exactly the same products, but they are very similar. You know, erm, as far as the statistics might go, you know, a car is a car is a car. So you lump them all together, but we know as consumers, that, the Skoda is inherently different to the Lamborghini or something, alright. Excuse me. Hello, Tim speaking. Hello Marina. Very well thanks, and yourself? Right Mhm essentially yeah, use it as a, erm, as a motivation for the, for the tutorial erm,partic particularly the, the first part of it, talking about GATT, sort of erm, the er, sort of characteristics of trade, how it's changed, indication of protectionism. No, no they don't. Well, yes it should, it should be, and there's some good figures in there that you may want to tell the students about, and then what I would do is recommend that they have a look at it because the current issue. That came out of the Current Issues in Agricultural Economics book. Alright, if you tell them erm, that's where it came from, there are copies in the library, it might be a good idea that they have a look at it. Alright? That's it, that's o that's okay, I don't think there's anything else, okay, yes, okay, cheerio, then Marina, bye . Right,erm, yes, so,inder intra-industry trade is growing very, very rapidly and that, and this is, sort of the main, one of the main reasons why trade in manufactures has grown rapidly, rapidly. Why's intra-indu intra, intra-industry trade grown? Well, as consumers, we like to er, consume differentiated products, right. Manufactured goods are easily differentiated, right, you've only got to bung power steering on a car, or a few go, go faster stripes and you have you know, sort of, to the consumer, a different product. Right, although it is still a car, it's, it has different attributes. Alright, so there's plenty of scope for differentiation, product differentiation. And also, erm, there's great scope for economies of scale er, in manufactured goods, therefore consumers can benefit, right from er, exploiting the comparative advantage in particular, in particular countries. Production tends to be focused on very large plants, erm, and each plant will produce erm, a particular good for the whole world market and so therefore trade must, must increase. So, perhaps those explanations might account for declining er, relative share in agriculture as well as the increasing share of manufactured goods, because the other side of that coin is, well, income elasticities of demand for agricultural goods is less than unity so there's a de declining sector aspect there, erm, is it easy to differentiate agricultural products? Very difficult. Right, it's not impossible because what tends to happen is that you can erm, you can change the product mix of what the consumer receives. Instead of him just buying purely the raw commodity, you can er, change the, the degree of processing erm, the quality of, of the product, erm, so there is some scope for different product differentiation, but certainly not the same scope that there is in manufactures. Do you think the scope has increased because of erm, packaging or whatever? Mm, I mean that's, it's, you know, a potato is a potato is a potato, in, you know in commodity terms, but you know, you can change the way the, the product by attaching lots of services to that raw food product, and that's where the scope for differentiation comes from, it's the, the combination of attributes in er, agricultural goods so you've T V dinners and all the rest of it. Erm, how about economies of scale, you said that was important the increase in manufacturing trade, you know, implies that products will be produced at a lower unit value, and therefore benefit consumers and er, therefore increase his trade cos consumers will buy the cheapest product if that comes from abroad, so be it. So what about economies of scale in agriculture? Do you think there are economies of scale to the same extent? No. Why, why not? It's more perfectly competitive, isn't it, I mean it's produced say, the scope for it is less because it's on a smaller scale in general. Mm, that's right, I mean the fact that agriculture tends to be perfectly com right, why there tends to be a lot of independent small producers is because there are no economies of scale, you know, apart from beyond, you know, a certain size of farm, you know,stud studies in the U K show that once you get, get beyond about two thousand hectares there are, there are significant dis-economies of scale, and although there are economies of scale up to that point, and that's only in the case of very specialist types of production, by and large once you've got a farm in excess of five hundred hectares, erm, you start to run into dis-economy, and mostly managerial dis-economies of scale. That's not the same er, well that's not the case with erm, with things like car man car manufacturing. I mean we can Toyota can produce, you know, sufficient Corollas or whatever it is that they make at Derby erm, to sat to satisfy the whole of the world market for that particular car, just from one plant. And that one plant occupies about sort of, one hundred and fifty hectares or something like that. If you wanted to erm, er, satisfy the demand for a particular food commodity you'd need erm, an area equivalent to the six biggest states in America. Clearly,that's not feasible. There's a geographical dimension involved in agricultural production, that leads to dis-economies of scale. Alright, and er, essentially land is the constraining, the constraining factor. Right, because we need land to produce food, more so than we need land to produce cars or tape recorders or whatever that sort of militates against economies of scale, and that's why we have erm, a large number of relatively small producers in this country and throughout the world. Erm, it's because you need land, and er, the bigger the area of land you've got, the more time it takes to get your combine harvester from one side to the other er, and so on and so forth. So, the optimal size of plant in agriculture is very, very small compared to the optimal size of plant in manufacturing. Okay, and that could be another reason why international trade, erm, has, had declined relatively in agriculture. Now anything else that may have accounted for the erm, decline of agricultural trade, and the increase in manufacturing trade? Because of erm, protection policies, Mm Like erm, the C A P in France. That's right, I mean protectionism in agricultural goods has risen, particularly since er, in the last fifty years. Risen dramatically, whereas in the same period, protectionism on manufactured goods has generally er, fallen, alright. So protectionism is probably quite important erm, reason. Why, why erm, does protectionism reduce trade? Reduces the erm, extra erm, revenue you can get from exporting or, or it intro increases the cost of importing Okay, yes, that's, that's one reason, yes. Reduced through retaliation. Okay, yes, leads to retaliation, anything else? Leads to loss of market. Mm, yes, leads to loss of market, you know. If we're self sufficient due to a policy that subsidizes our farmers, we're not going to want to import anything. So those are all reasons why trade in agricultural goods may have fallen, is protectionism in ari agriculture is second to none. There's no industry that's erm, as heavily protected as er, as agriculture on a world scale. Okay, so what, so what other effects does protectionism have? It reduces er, trade in agricultural goods, anything else? What about prices of agricultural goods. They go up. Sorry, sorry what? Prices of, on the world market. Right they'd certainly go up in the domestic Yes erm, domestic country, or the country where the protectionism is in place. Well, that must reduce trade as well, cos if, if prices are high in the domestic market, they're not going to want to sell them in another market are they? No, yes, that's very, very true, and that's the effect of protectionism, is to increase self sufficiency. Alright, however, if you want to sell. Yes, it increases self sufficiency, what about the prices of agricultural goods on the world market? The size of the world market in agricultural erm, goods and the volatility of prices on the world market? Aren't agricultural prices subsidized twice, they're subsidized to the farmers, so the farmer gets X for growing it which increases the price automatically on the market, but aren't they subsidized so they can be sold abroad? Yes, that's, that's true. So that's well, before we can go in, launch into this, I mean it's often said that erm, er, well, one of the major reasons why agricultural commodity trade hasn't been included in GATT, like virtually every other er, product has been, is because governments are saying, look this is a domestic policy, it's got nothing to do with international trade, we're supporting our farmers, it's a domestic policy. It doesn't, you know, it doesn't have anything to do with trade. Now, clearly that's a very naive way of looking at er, protectionism. But that's the main argument why agricultural policies have been allowed to increase in their severity, rather than erm, fall. That makes no sense, because they're selling that product abroad, the farm product, many of them are. They might be, they might be, yes. If they are selling it abroad, it's international though. Mm, ah yes, you can't, any domestic policy has international ramifications, if it affects er, resource allocation and, and demand and agricultural protectionism, like any protectionism will, will er, will reallocate resources, not according to comparative advantage, but according to some erm, some priority, we want to support our agriculture, therefore we'll erm, give agricultural producers a lot of money. Now, clearly that's going to dis distort trade because, if we're increasing domestic production Come in, ah, hi Mervin. Sorry, you alright for tomorrow? Yes, I can go to the lecture, but I'm teaching at eleven like yourself. I'll er, I'll see you if Win's free at, at eleven. Yes, yes, I've been to se I've a couple of people up to sort of promise a hand Yes, is, is, is Tony, is Tony er, busy as well? Tony's got a le meeting at ten thirty. Ah, which won't finish Fortunately I wasn't expecting to be lecturing, but er, Right I've had to lecture for Paul right, well we'll sort, we'll sort something out, but I'll see if Winnie's, I'll see if Winnie's available. Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that, yes, yes, okay. I mean if the worst comes to the worst, we'll sort of, cancel a lecture, or something Ah, well, it's only a matter of giving them a cup of coffee afterwards. Right, okay, I'm sure we can go, we can look after, we can get Robert in or something Yes, that's right we just get, just grab a couple of people. Sorry to disrupt your class. That's okay, I'll, I'll sort it out anyway, later this afternoon, yes, yes that's right, yes that's it Okay, ten o'clock, eight thirty nine. Do you want me to introduce us? Yes, if, if you want to, just to let the students know Sure, yes who he is, and why he's there. That's, that's grand, thanks, Melvin, cheers. yes, yes, okay, thanks for everything. Erm, right, where was I? Yes, so domestic policies, you know, can not be viewed at in isolation, right. All domestic policies will have international implications okay, and it's something that er, governments tend to erm, sort of over overlook when they're arguing the agriculturalists case in, in GATT. Then don't you think given that case, we should set up a whole inter international thing, which oversees all the governments? Well that's what GATT is really. That's what, you know, that's why agriculture is trying to be, sort of er, subsumed within the GATT. Yes, but it's failed. Well, it's, it's failed at the moment, but as, you know, if you've seen on television, or read a paper lately, you know, you've got ten days to go before erm, you know, if we're going to get a GATT agreement, you've got ten days to, to negotiate it in. Ten days to Er, yes, yes, that's right. There's a lot of brinkmanship going on at the moment, a lot of er, horse-trading I dare say, going on as well. Erm, but er, okay. Erm er, okey-doke, domestic policies will affect world, world market. It's likely, will world market prices fall? Or rise as a result of protectionism? Rise. Why might, why might they rise? Because they cost more. What costs more? Erm panic It may not do You know what tends to happen, is that world prices fall, alright, in the presence of protectionism. Alright, because what you're doing, is that you're increasing domestic production. Right now it serves its purpose, and increasing domestic production is going to increase world production, if there's more supply, prices will fall, if everything else stays the same. So what tends to happen is that world, world agricultural prices fall, right, and that trend has been observed erm, er, it's an im empiric empirically, agricultural product prices tend to have fallen in general sort of, over the last sort of, eighteen hundred years. Yes. So that, erm, the fact that you're increasing erm, protection, protectionism against it, isn't it likely to upset the producers who are exporting it, and who say it's no point exporting it there cos we're going to get erm, huge thing put on our things and we're not going to sell that much, it might be better just sell in our own country, isn't that reduce world tr No, no eventually, protectionism will, will lead to a cessation of production in the most efficient er regions of the world which by and large, are the, are the regions that sell onto the world market. It's only the inefficient producers that support their agricultures, because it's those inefficient producers that need support, erm, so, in the, in the long run, world supply, world supply will contract, but in the short run, you know, farmers in these er, efficient countries of the world may well erm, continue in production because they may, may be able to cut their average variable costs, it's only when in, in the long run, you know, providing farmers can cover their average variable costs, they'll continue in production in the short run. Right, in the long run, they've got to cover all their costs, right, they will be driven out of business, but that may take some time. Alright, so in, in the short run, because more is being produced, alright, and demand has been increased very much, or in world terms, then market prices will fall. All market prices will fall. And world market prices also tend to fall because these erm sort of protectionist programmes are often too successful, so not only do we reach self sufficiency, but you reach the status of net exporter. Now, for net exporting, for a net exporter, so our production exceeds our own consumption, how the hell do we er, how the hell do we get rid of it? Do we just burn it? Or do we dump it? What tends to happen is that domestic agricultural production has already been subsidized, alright, it's subsidized again, only to, to be sold on the world market. The world market becomes a residual, a residual market as a result, erm, you know, because we're dumping cheap products, you know, and the, the only way we can sell European grain right is to, is to undercut the world market. Now, because we're a major player in, in grain markets and most other markets, the European Community, increasing its supply on the world market will have a non-trivial effect on price. Prices will come down, right. Erm that's what we observe, is that protectionism leads to a lowering of world, world prices. What about the volatility? Does protectionism have an affect on volatility do you think? Right, think of it like this, if, if all countries of the world, right, engage in free trade, there is no protection. Alright. Then, the world market, alright, is, is the, is the world, is the world market. Everybody trades through this, through this world, world market. As a result, if there's a say, bad weather in the northern hemisphere affecting supply, right, that may well be offset by good weather, or average weather in the southern hemisphere, right. As a result, erm, prices won't be quite as volatile as they are in the opposite case, alright, when the world market, and virtually nobody, let's assume that virtually nobody uses the world market to trade in, they've all got their own agricultural policies, right, just a few countries trade in the world market, it only takes erm, a, a sort of poor harvest, or a very good harvest in any one of these erm, er, sort of protected countries, in order to get rid of this output, they'll put it on the world market. Because the world market is very, very tiny now, because nobody uses it, that will have a massive effect on, on world prices. So what you tend to observe is that when protectionism, when everybody protects, or when a lot of people protects, the world market erm, becomes a sink right, for any excess production. Right, it becomes a residual market, right. You know, if you can't sell it at home, you know, you get rid of it on the world market. Now, if the world market is very small, then The term world market is a bit of a misnomer when er, when most countries protect. The world market becomes very, very volatile and er, so protectionism tends to lead to erm, to price volatility and this is one reason why agricultural markets are so volatile. Right, it's, it's because world markets are residual markets because there's so much agricultural protectionism. Okay. Right,erm, why bother, why bother about agricultural trade? Marlon, why're we all het up about, about agricultural protectionism? What are we going to live on? Sorry? If we don't live off agricultural trade, what are we going to live on? We have to keep the track all turned on. I mean, vital to life Well yes, but it only represents two percent of G D P in this country it's, it's insignificant. Ah, that's the thing, it's not insignificant. Because if you stop agricultural production, you're going to be in big trouble. Right, okay. Why might we, we be in big trouble if it's a problem? What, what you going to eat? Well, could we not import? Exactly, and then if the world broke, world war breaks out? Okay, so there, there is this strategic argument. Okay, but why do we get the, the main thrust of erm, to the economic argument seems to be that we ought to be liberalizing, we ought to be facing that erm, that problem. You know, that problem isn't the most important one. Why, why do we want to liberalize world trade? So we can reduce the prices that we have to pay for everything. You know, beef and things that we have to import from the E C at the moment, we could import from like, New Zealand. It's far away but it's a lot cheaper to produce. Okay, so consumers would benefit erm, from liberalization. Presumably, also tax payers would erm, tax payer cost of er, the Common Agricultural Policies is substantial, and most the support comes from er, most of the support under the Common Agricultural Policy is given er, in terms of higher food prices that consumers pay. There is a different n there is also however, a tax payer burden in that some of our taxes that we pay to go erm, into agricultural support, I mean V A T for example. Virtually all of V A T goes to , you know. You know, you pay V A T on everything, er, so consumers would benefit, alright, in er, protecting countries, tax payers should benefit in protected countries. Any other beneficiaries? Developing countries may now find a market. That's right, so implications there for developing countries, who are typically very dependent on agricultural exports as a source of export earnings. It's through foreign exchange earnings that they can develop. Right, if you're cutting off their, their lifeline to development, you're probably sowing the seeds of er, of disaster further down the line. It's not only the developing countries that are dependent upon agricultural exports, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, other what you might not call developing countries, are also erm, reliant upon, is reliant upon agricultural trade. So, who, who are the beneficiaries, are there, are there any beneficiaries at the moment of liberalization? Clearly farmers in protecting countries benefit,any anybody else that benefits? From protectionism? Mm say if you're on the world, if you, if you're a net importer, right, erm, and you're buying your food commodities from the world market, you must have been rubbing your hands over the last fifty years cos you're getting , you're buying, you're buying a food commodities will lower, lower prices than you would have done in the presence of free trade, cos there's all this dumping and European surpluses, you know Come in Yes he is here Win Yes, erm, Sue's after you, if you going, she wants to know, can you go to lunch in ten minutes? When, One o'clock No I can't come, I'm dining with er, Charles and a post-grad. So Gerard's his name, erm, remind me to see about, are you free tomorrow at eleven? Yes, Tony's just dropped that on me Oh from a great height. No I'll, I'll speak to you, I'll speak to you later. Erm, er, clearly if you're a, a net importer of agriculture, you have benefited from other people's protectionism. Okay, and you will suffer as a result of liberalization, and by and large those costs, or those benefits that er, reaped at the moment by those countries are very, very small in comparison to the, er, the costs of protectionism to the rest of the world. Right okay. Tell you what we'll do is er, leave it there now. I would recommend you do is look in this book, there's a coup a couple of copies of which is, I mean er, is in the library, right. Current Issues in Agricultural Economics er, edited by your lord and master, Professor Rayner and also a chap called David Coleman okay so, Current Issues in Agricultural Economics by A Rayner and D Coleman. But if you look at chapter four in that book, we have the title, Agricultural Trade and the GATT. Alright, now the first part of this chapter spells out erm, er, developments in agricultural trade, why it's, why it's fallen in relative terms right. It then goes on to look at the costs of protectionism so they're, they're looking at erm, the numerical estimates as to how much erm, protectionism costs,not only for domestic producers and consumers and tax payers, but also for third countries. It then goes on to look at erm, why agriculture hasn't been included in the GATT up until now, and prospects for a solution within the GATT. This er, although it's not on your reading list, erm, the reading list that Bob gave to you, er, it, it should be. It's essential to erm, to what you've been going through in the last, in the last few lectures. Readable, full of erm, empirical evidence about costs of agricultural protection, and what's happened to agricultural prices and I re I do recommend that you have a look at it if you, it's an invaluable if you look at anything, look at, look at this one article. And there should be a couple of er, issues of this book in, in the library, okay, right, well thanks very much. Have a very good holiday and er,tomorrow there won't be a normal agri-econ lecture, there'll be a special lecture, but it'll be in the same place, same time. Hello, Tim speaking, I was on my way Charles. Okay, I'll see you in a minute. Bye . Right, that's it. Right. Mr was also sharing his wife with Mr ? I haven't heard that. No. Right. Okay, yeah, right. So you see where we get to? Yes. You go into the master bedroom, man and woman in bed. Isn't it obvious in a second that it's not it's Mr and Mrs ? At that time no. No I'm afraid not, no. You still thought it was ? When you burst into the bedroom ? I I'm being perfectly honest, I didn't know who it was. I I didn't know er and I didn't know the occupants of the flat. No but you did know that the husband and wife and . You had no reason to think that was er sleeping with the man's wife I say again No Isn't it obvious within a second that you must be looking at the husband and wife? I have to say again I'm sorry no it it wasn't obvious to me at that time definitely not. You thought it, is this right, you thought it could be it could be ? I have to say that yes. And it was only er when this man, could have been , said what are you doing in my house? Yes You that you accepted that as as conclusive that it was and not . Not conclusive but certainly that is when I started thinking that we didn't have . That more likely is that you realised well nigh immediately that it was Mr , that's why you said to Mr I'm arresting you for harbouring an escapee. I had good reason then to suspect that it could well be . Because of what he said? Because of what he'd said and because I'd asked his wife who he was. Not because he was in bed with his wife that didn't ? I didn't know that was his wife, erm . Well I did bother to ask who you'd thought would be in the flat, you said Mrs Mr . Yes yes that's correct, yes. One minor point you heard the give evidence, you know it's a issue between you whether you shouted armed police or you didn't. Of course yes. There's no point in me um rehashing that. But why, you'd just forced the door open prior to arrest why do you wait until you got to the bedroom, indeed got the bedroom door open before shouting armed police. Why isn't it shouted from the start so that everybody knows from the start who you are? Okay right yep. Well the situation there is firstly there is little point in shouting and identifying ourselves if, firstly there's nobody in the flat, or secondly er we're giving advance warning that we are coming along the corridor to a possible location, er of somebody with a firearm. So what we would do then is identify the fact that we've come into the building and therefore alerted everybody that lo and behold down the corridor are coming police officers. But I thought you were saying in answer to a question my was putting to you that one of the reasons for shouting armed police was so that everybody knows you're armed police. That is correct yes, but only when we encounter somebody in front of us. Prior to that, definitely not. You weren't more than from the hall you were about six foot to the door to the master bedroom. I I can't recall . It was very close, yes. Crossing that distance I suppose in a hurry was going to take you erm considerably less than a second. Definitely, we don't if we were crossing an area that hadn't been secured by any other officer, so we were particularly concerned that we should get out of any possible danger area. So I'd suggest again that the sensible place to shout armed police is as soon as you enter because the fraction of a second between you getting from the hall to the bedroom isn't going to make any difference. Yes, I'd argue that it does make a difference, because we are announcing the fact that er we are coming along to to possibly alert somebody er that we were coming into a building and then hence we encounter even more problems. You can't answer for the other officers but you can answer for yourself. Would you agree with Mr that on this sort of raid the adrenaline's flowing? Without a doubt, definitely. Is a specific gun, issued to a specific officer or is it just er a a group of guns issued to a group of officers? Er, the easiest way to answer that is er all of our guns have a unique serial number. So for example, if I went on er a job on Monday I could possibly draw gun number three but the following day if we went on a similar operation I might get gun number six. So, there is no specific gun issued to an individual officer as his own personal weapon. Yes I'm sorry I I Oh sorry didn't mean that, what I meant was on this er exercise were, was it written down for instance that erm P C has Smith er Smith and Weston number thirty two? Yes that's correct yes. . In the heat of the operation is there anything to stop you handing it to one of the other officers if that should be necessary? No not at all my Lord. In fact er just prior to the start of the operation er I made a decision to change the shotgun holders over. I have to say now in at this moment in time, I can't remember why I did it, but it was an operational decision that was made en route to the flats that we swopped shotguns with er another officer. Sorry. very clear, you've got two officers with shotguns, do you mean that it's just he gave his shotgun to him and vice versa or you nominated two different shotguns? I I recall that I in effect directed that an officer should carry a shotgun as opposed to the original officer that er was down for that weapon. Yes the shotguns were just ordinary twelve bore double barrel shotguns were they? Er my Lord they're twelve bore, single barrelled pump action shotguns with a slightly shorter length er than is a normal shotgun that you'd purchase in er a firearms dealers. Oh. Can you remember now who the shotguns were originally issued to? I have to say I'm afraid I can't erm I have thought about this yes. Because the the nettle I'm grasping is this ah it is said by the , both of them, that it was you who had what they call a long barrelled gun, it must be a shotgun. Yes. So I was hoping that there'd be a record showing one way or the other but if Okay you'd swopped over the record wouldn't help, is that right? That would be correct yes. So But that is certainly not the case, I did not have a shotgun. Well I appreciate you deny it because er you said in answer to my friend that erm as I am required by rules to put it, er I do put to you that yes, you did have a shotgun, perhaps erm borrowed from one of the officers, yes you did put it to Mr head and you did tell him to er er shut up and wait for C I D. I can assure everybody that that is not correct. That is totally wrong. Now what about Mrs ? While you were in the bedroom where was she? She was er still in bed. On oh sorry, in, lying down or on sitting on the edge? Er she'd sat up er obviously when we moved into the bedroom and from there I'm not exactly sure what she was doing, in as much as she wasn't a threat so therefore perhaps I I didn't pay that much attention to what she was doing. My direction was gazed er drawn to the man. Let me try and jog your memory. She says that when you erm pointed the gun against her husband's head she went towards you, grabbed by another officer. Right . Do you disagree? Well I disagree in as much as I have said that I didn't have a shotgun and ignoring that fact then that I didn't have a shotgun she certainly did not make a lunge at me. You don't seem able to recall what said either at the start or er somewhat later after he'd been handcuffed. What he says he was saying is who the fuck are you, recall that at all? No no I don't no. Well do the best you can er I don't want exact words obviously but what was the burden of what he was the gist, the effects of what he was saying? With respect er I wasn't paying too much attention to er to what was being said in as much as this possibly sounds negative but our concern is not for what people are shouting at us our concern is for whether we've got a threat er in a particular area, in this case the bedroom, and whether we can try and sort that threat out before somebody is injured. Whether it's us or an innocent member of the public. Yes but forgive me you must listen to what's said to you because somebody might be saying to you Lawrence is under the bed. Oh yes, yeah of course. So you listened what roughly was said? I listened but if it's of no evidential value there is no point in listening because I've got so much on my mind at that time erm to to sort out that threat in there that I certainly can't recall what was exactly said or even along the lines of what was said. But I erm, I don't think there's much between you and erm the plaintiff on this. You say when you had handcuffed him he said something to me asking along the lines of what were we doing in his house. That's correct my Lord yes. Well he says when he had been handcuffed I said who they were, who the fuck are you? Which sounds exactly the same isn't that right? Along those lines my Lord yes. Yes. And er again I have to put to you I you've heard the say and I do think you'll disagree. Sure. What I suggest to you is far more officers than the three you gave evidence of perhaps five or even the full six at some stage found their way into that master bedroom. That is not correct in as much as every individual officer was tasked to an individual action and therefore there was no need to come into that bedroom the area er if they'd have heard shouting or whatever in that bedroom they would have known not to come into that area because there was obviously a threat in there. Well if what you say about this information that was in the master bedroom is true, they might have every reason to come into the master bedroom to see if er the, who was sleeping in the . No because our training is such that there isn't the officers just would not come into that bedroom at all because there is a threat in there and I'm dealing with that threat and unless I specifically call for another officer to come and give me a hand there is no need to come in and in fact if anybody had've done they'd have been told to get out because I've got a problem there and that's my problem. So presumably two of the armed officers remained guarding this eleven year in bedroom two and two remained covering the kitchen? No that's not correct because I've also already called up to P C into that master bedroom when I've left or as I was about to handcuff er the man. So we then have three officers in there and I leave leaving the two officers whilst I go and check the rest of the place out. So who was left guarding in the small bedroom one or that ain't very nice! And i and instead of Ma , no Frankincense to offer have I , he goes,Frankincense to o , no,Frankincense to Jesus to Well you'll singing o for the infants aren't you? Yeah. Well that's gonna be in the church then, that Yeah We three kings of Orient I, What . That's in a week! It's next week! No it isn't, it's the eighteenth. Well it ain't the eighteenth next week cos the . We're doing it next week! Well I don't think you are. Next Friday I think! I don't think so. What's today? What's the date? What's the Well it says on here look Jonathan, if you look! What's today? It says a Christmas service will be held in the oh no it isn't the juniors are now helping the infants with their nativity story on Wednesday the eighteenth of December this was originally a advertised, by me, at taking place at six thirty in Walton St. Peter Church, I'm afraid this was a mistake on my part, as in fact the performance is rather ten thirty on the da on that day at Walter St. Andrew Church. This timing will enable even the youngest children to take part. Mum'll go to that cos I like carols. I'm not! Well course you are going to it! Don't want to! Why? I don't like them new words! They're rubbish! Right, and the other story goes The angels go to Be Can you get off to sing to him I'm ready! the angels going to sing to him. I'm ready Jonathan! Now quickly! Get them in, get them in, get them in, them in get them in, get them, get them in, them in doodle oodle ooh,. I'm sitting here tonight. I'm sitting over there mum. Why? I like sitting over there better. Well then why did you let me put all your things you have that side? nee nee nee nee nee nee nee nee nee nee . Right, let's give you some chips. . Is that enough? Who was that first one from? What? That first what? fit four people in there won't we? Where? This , 's, Auntie Val. Yeah a lot of people have been there, I do agree. Helen or Yes. is that who that was from? Yeah, Helen,yes. Oh. Ooh that ball isn't half noisy, I hate that ball! Where's my beans? I think I'll t Beans, beans beans please! beans, beans, a beans, a beans . Where's your manners just lately, you've lost them since you've been to school! Mm. How many do you want? That's enough. Thank you. What? What are you me for . Don't show your ignorance please! Don't you mean I don't what you mean! Well there is a please and thank you word! Yeah thanks. Oh dear! Uncle Ken went up there. Up where? The play. Oh no that's all I need! . Yeah? Can I just ask you . Yeah well he's not home yet. Isn't he? No. Oh alright I'll come, pop back later then. Yeah he shouldn't be long before he's home but Yeah. pop back. Erm I can't tell you what time he'll be home really erm well say in the twenty minutes he's bound to be home cos he he's been home and then he's had to shoot out again, he's gone to get the battery so he won't be long. No, alright then. Alright? I'll give him a bell about in half hour about six o'clock? Yeah yeah that'll be fine, yep, yeah. Okay then thanks a lot. Okay then yeah, bye! Bye! About half five! Silly git! It is half five! say that about people mum's awful saying that! Especially when the tape's on! Ooh I forgot about that! Yeah well mum can't he looked alright. Ooh! I burnt myself! I've done you one as well. Oh no! What are they? Oh well me and dad will have to have more each. I don't think you'll like them anyway Jonathan. I've had one before didn't like it. That's what I thought I should think dad'll come home now that he's gone. Erm Put it on the table cos he's bound to walk in. I bet he doesn't. Yeah, if you put it on the table he won't, and if you don't Well I'll leave I can't wait any longer, I'm hungry. Mr went to the dentist this morning didn't he? Dunno probably. He just after dinner or this morning. Who did you have teaching you this morning then? Not all morning. Well part of the morning, who taught you this morning? Mr . I thought you said he went to the dentist? Mm nobody we just had to get on with my work. Oh Mr kept an eye on us. Which classroom was he in then? Mr next door next door. Oh he's gone back in his own classroom now has he? No it's just they need a teacher. You need a lot of teachers don't you? Yeah. What teacher do you like the best? Miss . Do you? Ooh that's nice! Well you can't have it, you've eaten yours! Oh. Have it next time. Did Kelly go on about her teeth? No. Never. What? Oh I had a giggle! Oh! I had a tiny bit of a giggle! Why?

They want it about eleven but I said, can you get down to get it? Because your dad won't be there, will he? I have a your dad can I thought it'd be back by now. Aha. And also that young chap's been here for the van. Oh yeah. It was a nice little feller. Yeah and he's he's gonna ring you about half past six. Was that that bloke that rang me up? or anything like that. No Dunno! What colour coat has he got on? Got jeans on him. hasn't he got a red coat? He had another boy with him might But who's got a red coat? Had he got a red coat? I dunno. Cos if he had a red coat, with a little white patch on it I see him walking round the village. I have had them erm Mm. you like them do you? Yeah. Oh. I don't mind them. Where's your other half then? You what? not needed, give me that half. Don't like the peas. Oh I thought you was on about the pie. No, don't mind the pie no I meant don't like them new peas. They ain't got a lot of flavour have they? No. I've done all inside that van. Mm. Just gotta wash the outside. you wanna charge for it. Yeah, cos it's Sun , Saturday. No he don't, Mr has it tomorrow! Ooh crumbs! What are you gonna say to him? Sorry you can't have it. Well he's moving furniture as well. Well you said to me he could have it he said I'll have tonight. Yeah but he must bring it back by nine! Why? I forgot Mr was having it. Mm. So your mum won't be able to go shopping till nine then? No. Well they don't normally go till about nine anyway well they can't cos the post office don't open till do you want a coffee? No I'll have a cold drink I don't mind what it is. Do you know I've been so busy, I done that van this morning, I've done my housework and two loads of washing been over Petes' did I tell you? Yeah. rang you? No. Do you need salt? No. Do you the pies? Make a change didn't it? I quite like them. Yep. Not a lot of meat in them though is there? Oh, I'd have this then I Who's is that? Them ones we got from . Oh. Posted them letters did you? Ha! No. Where are they? to post tomorrow. Well I'd have done them myself! Well I got a post office aren't I? We ain't heard a word from Jimmy have we? No I got . Pardon? I got . Why, what you gotta do? that car back from Fiesta got the minibus going out got the estate car,he and Jimmy's look, he talks about Mr , he has left that like a tip! It stinks of kid wee! But to work this morning, I could of done it! Mum? I said take the bus. Yeah but you said you'd be busy! Yeah but I could of when I got home! Now I've gotta do it in the dark! tell me . Well the hoover won't , except I had to scrub that mini that erm that van, it was so filthy! Yeah. And now who ? He did. Jimmy did. I wonder where he's getting his vehicles from this week? He's got his ain't he? I thought you said they stopped the ? Well, he isn't supposed to be using it. Can I have a spoon please? The bailiff said he couldn't use it. Bloody ridiculous that man! So someone bought the bailiffs in for sixty two quid! A T S. Who's A T S? Tyres and . You don't owe them nothing do you, I hope? Nothing to do with A T S, don't like them. Precisely for that reason I should think! Well wha what he said was he went up there there's erm could they put on the front wheels to the back and the back wheels to the front didn't say anything the bloke said, well we can't charge you. Oh. And the bloke said well we can't charge you for that. So this is isn't what it's all about? Well, that's how it all come see he owes them a hundred and seven pound and er when he asked them change the tyres over they wouldn't do it. Oh. Yeah but they said we can't charge you for it he said we sell a new tube or sell you a new tyre he said we can charge you but we can't charge you labour. That's ridiculous innit? Yeah, so he said well charge me for wheel balancing then or something no he said, we can't do that. He's just being awkward by the sound of it. So he said will you do it for nothing? And he said it's not a charity case! Could you pay him to do it? He says no. Said fair enough he said and with that I come out the garage. Well why don't he use that bloke at St. Johns, who you use? He does now. So erm he's phoned up me your money cos he said they daren't put me in court you see. Well that's a ridiculous thing to do! Well they say they're gonna put you into court, you get it paid don't you, before anything goes further? Yeah yeah well you see what he said was he could not see how they could warrant him that sixty odd come as interest justify doing it. It will all depend how long has he owed them it. Possibly about a year I think. Cor! My God! So he said, I'm not having that! And walked round ah so they er got a, sort of court bailiff involved. For sixty two pound, it must of cost them more than that! Cost a lot of money I would of thought. They obviously don't like him do they? No well erm it's a big firm so Perhaps it's what they did in is er . Yeah but he's got his self a bad name now isn't he? Yeah. It made me laugh when your mum kept on about him last night, about having all his hampers stolen. Yeah. Twenty two grand! Ridiculous innit? The blokes on the make isn't he? Yeah. You see he's and then he had the cheek to charge me for insurance! Well I expect him to pay the insurance. Who did pay the insurance? did, but I gonna give it back. Well I should think so,gonna get twenty two grand out of it! Cos he'd have taken them to court and said well he didn't even pay it, I did! Well actually they erm I think the maximum they'll pay out is eighteen thousand. Yeah but I don't think that's gonna be such an easy case to . Well, I don't. You know it looks to me They said they'd got it. they think that it's all cut and dry, well they haven't got the then people will come round and investigate yet! No. Mum that'll come out on the tape! Well I can't stop it cos the kettle's boiling! Don't be silly! Mum is there any shandy please? Baby . Jonathan put that straight in the bin for mum, will you please? Yeah. You yum You know . Colin? Yum. Who's got a . Yeah. he was saying , they're going to Yarmouth. Ah! I see. that's where they're going cos he said they he's not actually for the itself Yeah. it's you know, for the workers, they're going out on a meal. So who's paying it then? He is gonna pay his self. Tomorrow? Yeah. Oh that's . Well they can . Well I presume so. What did he er He ought to have done it through the college got it cheaper. Ah oh oh! He said this is nothing to do with the college. Why don't he er Well I suppose he's, the man's got his reasons. I was gonna say what you mean, put petrol in it? Seems stupid! Yeah cos you gotta lay out money aren't you? Yeah so if I decide to Oh he said, when he's finished I don't whether he's not picking it up till later on. Ooh and another that's what I wanted to tell you about well I don't think we can help him out. Oh well. Gentleman wanted a minibus Yeah. now, he talked rather nice erm with having four Yeah. I can't remember his name at all I can I can't think of it now. I'm gonna go and watch T V. Well what he wanted, he wanted a minibus from there to there and there well we can't can we? We can have one from there to there but he can't have one here. Daddy, mummy Can he? thinks the key was down I the Jonathan I don't really Just a minute Jonathan , let mum because the college has got one there Yeah. Toby's got one there and got the other one there. Yeah. Well what time is Toby coming back? Well so he can't have that one then? And the Isle of Ely college is going out for a meal, so that won't be back, so he can't have that one, so we haven't got one! No. For Friday night, but he can have one sort of, first thing Saturday morning. But otherwise we haven't got one. No er erm, and that lady's gonna ring about the Fiesta and then that young boy's gonna ring about the van. Hooray! But that means that won't get cleaned outside for Mr Mr . Well but it's very clean inside, I scrubbed it. Mm. And polished it. Mm. I wouldn't of thought he'd of worried too much about the outside. Well it isn't that bad, it's only down the bottom anyway. No, under the right hand side, there's none the left hand side Well I said I only washed one side. I started washing my . Who turned the light out? I did! Why? Well that's gotta be back by nine in the morning. Yeah. As long as he's got that back in the yard by nine. Well I did see him, he seemed alright but you see you can't tell what people are like,yo you may think they have ni I know. nice personalities but he could now do a runner with our van couldn't they? Yeah. I reckon that's what honky tonk was on the other night though. Yeah. Was he? I reckon he's in trouble. Yeah. So let me just think. So well, he could have the van well how much would you charge him for tonight? Twenty quid. Yeah cos Mr 's got the Renault. I told my mum Oh in decent state he didn't last time I scrubbed well I wou go on Monday? No. Oh. Yeah well they sho I said I'd I was looking through this Mm and I was thinking cor we say we haven't been doing very well, but look at that week there! And then look it's not Yeah. too bad for this time of I bet we're doing better this year, this time of the year than we did last. Yeah . Well you see you do that minibus want cleaning up, that blue one or was that clean before we put it in the shed? No that's part of the the windows washing but I'll quickly washed over them just to spruce them up a bit but I thought if I put Mrs in that, is she driving, or is she not? Erm, I should imagine so. Yes, she is. Is she? Don't she like the column change? No. Oh God! Well I can't help it. Well you'll just have to explain to her, the other one Yeah. hasn't come back after you've Well no , no what I'm saying was, the fifteen seaters here you see but I can't, I shan't be put the petrol in for the both shall I?clean tomorrow night. Well I don't know what time she's picking it up at actually. Oh. I should imagine that's his number. What number? I hope he paid you this week then. Yeah,. Well you with his money you can pay off them two bills. Yeah. Cos yo you don't put them through do you? His? Have you No. put any on ? Well then forget about this time, that won't hurt will it? We've been doing alright otherwise. Mm. Pete was talking about his Roly he said June, he said he is such a character! So I said, is he?

How much were these Gail? Sixteen ninety five. They're alright They look alright. Alright, aren't they? Yeah.. Not really. the same. If I put hers Tell you how to do, see, right Gail? It's an hour . Put her foot on it when she comes in , that's her school bus, bus thirteen, do they fit her? Do they fit her? Yeah only just, that's . When she comes in keep this out right? Yeah. And when she comes in, what's that one, put her left foot on it, right? Yeah. And if, if her foot overlaps it all, take them back, cos you might be better off just getting two anyway Yeah. cos Scott's, Scott's in a two football boot, there sort of thing innit? Yeah. She's gonna wear her thick socks with them,dangling aren't they? Yeah. That's what I'd be inclined to do so on top of the telly, and say just put your foot on here a minute, now, they look quite thin now, but, that's what I was looking at, yeah, cos her feet are fat, yeah, but they, that do like that don't they? Yeah, that, yeah ,spreads out to the side anyway, don't it? Yeah, put these . Try her foot on it and if it don't, if her foot overlaps Yeah. then take them back up and get a two. Cos the thing is as well, I might be inclined to get a two anyway, because she wants it to last a little while don't she? Anyway , yeah. They're not gonna last very long not a like that is it? Is that how it was? Yeah. That was quick . Yeah . Yeah. I'm not going to do no housework today. , see mum and dad on Saturday at . Yeah.. If erm Go on. if her foot's wide, wider than that would it matter? Well yeah, cos it ought to be tight on her, across. But if her foot's wider, you'll get the bigger size it'll take it up on the length bit. Yeah. So I'd be more inclined, let me have a look at her when she comes in, send her up. Yeah see, is it, I mean sometimes Scott's foot too wide for a both sides. Mm. Yeah their trainers upstairs they still, they fit alright. Yeah. They're not tight, that's why I went for a one cos I thought it's like a trainer innit? Yeah yeah You look quite a way . Only other thing I can you do is try it on when she's asleep. That's what I do with his football boots I bought him,. I, I looking at them . Yeah. They look big enough don't they? Yeah Yeah, alright then. I'll see you later on. I'm sorry I, I nearly walked out, yeah, that's not him, not let him, that watch that, cos it is a bit It's not too bad No. It could be a lot worse. No, there's been she could say what she doing?

Were talking about whether we should be going out to work or not? No,. . Hello sweetheart. I feel like I can be contributed towards for I must admit that, I do feel as though I could be pulling my weight a bit, especially when Chris worries about money. Yes. Like, you know, I saw like, what really, I'd sat there, I mean like you say, I and I admit that I odds and ends that'll probably take me about an hour in total Mm. you know, I have got to get , I mean we've got it wasn't us who pushed it from our end, more and more brides came to us, so therefore we grew. Mm. Sort of My wedding wasn't an ordinary wedding, I was married on top of Arthur's Seat and erm You were married on top of Arthur's Seat Yes, at sunrise on Christmas Eve four years ago and, it was important for us to do exactly what we wanted because erm it was a second wedding for both of us and it was also erm we wanted to have something that represented sort of the aspirations of love and so, sunrise erm, and on the top of a hill did that for us. And, if you can find a minister that's willing to go wherever you want to go! In Scotland you can, can do almost anything. Aren't you a minister yourself? Yes. So have you, have you performed any un unconventional weddings? Yes, erm well I I've not done a wedding in a church actually yet, but then I've only done three weddings, and, but the most interesting one was in a Brock in Glenelg and erm, that was quite exciting because the couple really thought about the service and they had selected that sight because it meant something to them, and involved the whole community and thereabout, and it was great! Mm. Do you mind if I ask you about, about your own wedding o on the top of Arthur's Seat on Christmas Eve four Mhm. well Christmas eve was it? Yes, Christmas eve, well Did you have many guests at sunrise? Well we, we had about sixty erm, people that trudged up to the top of the hill including erm, one who didn't know there was a wedding, he was a runner, and then he and he had tagged the top of Arthur's Seat and was astonished to see a crowd there. What do you wear to a mountain top wedding in the middle of winter? Well you wear an anorak and a woollen skirt and walking shoes. Is that the most unusual wedding we have in this hundred tonight? I mean, has e ,ye yes, yes it seems so, yes! No ones, no ones gonna do anything crazier than that! You touched on church weddings, now lots and lots of people do get married in church, although many of them aren't er aren't necessarily church-goers, now Chrissie, can I, can I pick on you? You perfo yo as a Church of Scotland minister Aha. you perform weddings? Yup! If people aren't church-goers do you, will you still give them a church wedding? Yes. Why? Cos not all ministers will will they? Well I think it gives them a link with the church, erm and they don't just come in and say oh yes, turn up on Saturday and you'll get married, there's some meeting before that Mhm. so that we don't all meet as strangers on the day. We found that a lot of young couples that because you don't go to church on a regular basis but erm, to go along with their parents' wishes too, rather than going through a big church wedding in a church, they go to a hotel and they have the erm, wedding ceremony and the reception all in the hotel, and are married by a minister. And that So there had to be Yes. A minister will go out to a ho hotel. Yeah. Have you done that Chrissie? Have you ever Yeah I have. Erm, I don't like it er, not for particularly any religious reason but for the fact that the church is purpose-built for weddings and a lot of hotels aren't, so you get the girl with the ball gown, spent hundreds on it, and she's squeezed up sometimes and nobody can see her! But erm I prefer to marry in the church. Angela? We were married at home, and one of the reasons why is because we bought a very old house about three years ago and on the top floor it has a, a large room which used to be the ballroom, and we did a little research and we found that the last wedding that we know of in the house took place in seventeen fifty eight, when apparently it was very common in Scotland to get married at home, it was more uncommon to go to church. Mm. We did some more research and we found out that in return for doing this you had to pay the minister a fine, so we found a minister who was very excited by the idea of marrying us in a seventeen century house, and in fact, on the morning of the wedding he was more worried about what he was wearing than what I was! And erm, it wa , at the reception afterwards we actually paid him the fine er, a contribution to a a, a fund his church had for a painting they wanted to buy. They pay the minister a fine? Yes. But it's not convention of course, to pay the minister anything is it? I mean, Church of Scotland Ministers don't get paid. No. Er, it's different in other churches I think. Some, I think some people sometimes give a gift,I've never, I don't think I've had a gift ! Mhm. I'd been, a few weeks ago I'd been to a wedding, and it was the most boring ceremony I ever been in all my life! I get married about eleven years ago, it was four of us, me and my, the groom and two witnesses. It was a special day but every day of my life it's a special so it's nothing, I would not do it again, you know, just to but er, I think most of the time the wedding in here is much more geared for how the bride look like and photographer, it is all the time for four hours, how you stand, it's nothing normal,noth nothing natural, nothing Mhm. nothing happy, you ju just to stand there, you can't laugh properly and you can't do this, and you can't do this, it's worse So you think people are forced into conventional modes because they fe It was awful! How often do we, we really feel that the bride and groom are the people who make the choice? Mm. Is it not the parents Mm. who are inclined to impose their choice on the bride and groom in a lot of cases? Is, was that your experience? Not me personally but I have known a few people who've wanted perhaps, a very quiet wedding, just in a registry office, and finished up with a large church wedding. Mm. You talk about Brides' magazines, or any of the other magazines that are there, it's all set out, it's all hyped up and, I think a lot of people feel they ha , really have to get married in that way. Hannah? I was just going to say that being a photographer, we find that more and more people come with their mothers instead of the fiance whenever they're going to get married, and it is all the time, the mother has a big say in it you know, instead of the couple. Well now, there must be some mothers here who er Any mothers who've married off their daughters in this dictatorial way, saying you must have this dress! You must allow No. to spend seven thousand pounds on you! Yes? Expectations just went too far! For instance, I mean er my boyfriend,excuse me, I've been er living with him for years, and I have a child. Now I was at a wedding a little while back and all they were asking me was are you gonna be the next one? Are you gonna be the next one? It's like, I've already been asked, and I've refused, and I want to know why is it people put so much pressure on you to get married? For instance, in the hospital they were calling me Mrs, because er the stigma er, is so much, and I mean er, I even get called a single parent and I'm not! I have a very stable relationship, and also with my child, and I know that it would be very difficult for us to split up, but I don't see why a bit of paper or a lovely ball gown, or a nice cake, will make it any better for me at all? You're not No! I just But what about the child? Th er, well for instance er, the child has took his name, I mean er you know But why can he take his name when he's your child and you haven't different names? It doesn't matter because I I love him so much? What about the child though? Well why should I have a pretty dress and a cake when it's the love that's there and not a piece of paper or a special day! Up there. Er I have a great sympathy for for that lady. I think I will be a very unconventional mother, and having two daughters of my own I am appalled by the cost that this is going to erm involve! Ah, if you're to believe the press that it costs about seven thousand pounds for a wedding, an average cost for a wedding Mhm. I would far rather say, if I had the seven thousand pounds, say to both my daughters there you are dears, there's the seven thousand pounds you decide how much of that you want for your wedding what is left over you keep, and it would be interesting to find out how much they then spent on their photographers, and on their cake, and the, the wedding cars etcetera. I would just to say, I think women, women are such victims of the fashion industry and I think there's a lot more hype surrounding th the bride than there is surrounding the groom and er I think erm, you know th a lot more thought needs to go into the whole thing, there's so much pressure on young people, particularly girls and there's sa , so much idealism around the whole thing erm, and and there's a lot of alternatives to marriage, you know, and this is discounted as th , the woman over there said, about being referred to as Mrs, particularly when you're over a certain age if you're not married. Have you had a wedding? No. No. I've managed to avoid it! Mm mm. I think it depends very much on the age of the people getting married Mhm. young people very commonly are escorted by their mothers and the thing is, the politics of the family and showing themselves to their friends, but more and more we're dealing with people Now you're a caterer? I'm a caterer. Yep. probably my age and, even a bit older, thirty, forty, getting married, sometimes a second time, and they say this is our party Mm. and they are not influenced, I don't think, by a large amount of hype and fashion. And there, as someone else said, erm earlier, organizing their party, the day of their life which happens to be also their wedding day, and those sort of parties are far more fun to work at than the far more stilted family affairs that do happen for younger people. With regards about the lady that you've the relationship, a stable relationship, not being married another lady pointed out, but what about the child? Maybe get married and maybe not work out, then divorce, so what happens to the child then? Mm. I don't think it's any different. I think we've, we've said quite a bit about erm previously about the symbolism of, of a wedding, if Mm. it's a special day to you, you know getting married on the top of Arthur's Seat or whatever, but what about for the majority of people who who have a church wedding and the symbolism there that just goes unstated. This whole thing of the bride being, well often not, but frogmarched down the aisle and being transferred from being her father's property to being her husband's property and that being taken by, by taking his name! You know, there's a lot of symbolism that really has been lost, people don't think about in the wedding service, but is underlying, you know, until fa fairly recently a lot of people promised to obey, erm, look at Prince Andrew and that when he got married, you know, erm, the Duchess of York actually promised to obey him That was her choice presumably. and what does that say for, what does say for women erm, and for the status of women in this country? Well, in her case, presumably, she wanted to say she would obey him and and subsequently perhaps she has, and he's very happy with that, but that's a fairly cynical view isn't it, the the the bride's a kind of ceremonial heifer, who's had in lace, in lace? I mean doesn't that But that, there is a lot of a symbolism there that people don't seem to look at Mm. anymore, you know because it's the nice ceremony and because it's it's a do. Yes? Er, I vividly remember my, my wedding day, and the bit I remember most is actually waiting to go into church with my father, and I remember being particularly moved at that time thinking that that was the end of one era and about to become part of another and I didn't feel that I was being owned somebody and about to be owned by anyone else in the slightest! Mm. I think when you talk about symbolism of a wedding, in actual fact, what does a wedding say? It says, very little about the practicalities of life. If people are going to prepare to spend the rest of their lives together, they should be discussing much more important things than concepts, like forever, they should be discussing, what happens if it's splits up? Which it statistically now, is quite often going to do. But surely, sitting down working out the legality of it, working out sensible practical things is a much more sensible way of proving you love somebody, and that you're you're genuine about it! But you're not sensible when you're in love! You're not sensible when you're in love! Well maybe you should be sensible! ! Maybe that's why so many children are products of broken, broken ! homes now! When you're go into a marriage Mhm. go into a wedding, you go in believing that it is forever that's it! That's right! You take your vows, you commit yourself! But it usual , but nowadays it quite often But that's why so many babies isn't forever and people don't think often enough That's statistics, I mean there's well maybe statistics are . But if you have a wedding day, you are going in there saying I'm going to live with this person for the rest of my life. Oh! Yeah. And you firmly believe that at the time! Up there. Yeah? Er, I would like to know how much of the the, the, the thing about the bridal magazines and the whole idea of, of a wedding is portrayed and the media has an influence on a a young girl wanting to get married rather than the actual you know,th th , you know how much sh she knows the person, or loves the person, maybe it's the, the whole image of the wedding that takes over, you know, erm rather than the, the, the practicalities. Well Moira, were you over influenced by the media, wanting to have that No. big day? I lived with my husband for er, three and a half years, and I knew him for a good number of years before then, so we made a joint decision after that period of time that we were, wanted to commit ourselves Mm. and we looked on it more as a party and a family gathering and showing everybody else that we were now committed and we're going to spend the rest of our lives together. Well there's been some scepticism about the symbolism of, of weddings there's also some scepticism about the reality of making that vow forever, er, which I personally have sympathy with cos I don't see how you can say you're going to do anything forever, but I suppose if you've made a vow you've got to stick with it. Is it possible to have a wedding ceremony that er, that dodges those rather difficult bits? I mean, Chrissie, are you allowed to have a wedding ceremony tha tha which says erm I'll love you for as long as I can possibly manage? I've heard erm people saying, I think it was in America erm, as, as long as you both shall love instead of as long as you both shall live. Yes. If you get married in a registry office, which I did, you don't say an , in England, you don't say anything other than that you take this chap to be your husband, and you interpret that to be as you wish. So that's, entirely up to the pair of you. I think that these inflated ideas perhaps come with the old language of the church, and if you're going to do that well then, all hail to you and er presumably you mean it if you've gone there. There are people who come from from different cultures amongst this hundred who might want to say something about erm, wedding ceremonies. I got married twenty three years ago in China, well, we just invite er, invited er our friends, and er former school mates to ma , to my home and we didn't make any vow, er we just gave a banquet to the friends, and er, in China people now can get married in many ways and er some foreigners have come to China to get married in a traditional Chinese way, and they have to er, carry their bride in a sedan chair. And their bride has to wear er, all in red and er the bridegroo er groom has to wear a long costume with a red big flowers in front i aha and then they get married and there's erm band, the Chinese traditional band with drums and trumpets blowing all the time and er, all the guests have a very nice time. And in China, usually, erm wedding is an important event in the family and an , when I got married I think my parents-in-law wo erm felt erm more excited than my husband and I ! Well that's,tha I mean tha that's, a pretty interesting description of er of a different kind of wedding, which is another one er another Well optional variation that you might well I got married in want to choose? Yes? Bu I meet a erm, a different oh, tribe in Saherli but I got married in England with my, though we make , this, I'd say, this man to be my wife forever, but when I got home, back home in Ingeria you know, we did it in a, a different way. We have er, my parents sat down with a the group of the family there Mm. you know, there's no vow there, but all we do is join hands together, share blessings to both of us, and no vow, we never make any vow but they made a blessing for us. The marriage will be successful and this one it is . There. Well I'd,, I come from Lebanon and I get married in here and I said the vows but I didn't understand, at that time I wasn't speaking English so Oh! Oh! Oh yeah! That's one to remember, I didn't understand what I was saying! Yes? But in Lebanon we don't have vows, they have like kind of contract, and if the if they broke the contract it's the bride and groo , the groom have to pay that amount of money for the the bride, even if it was her fault. It happens in my country, when you break the marriage, I mean in my town, when you break th the marriage this sort of money will be paid wi then. Whe when you're to make Mm. a er, but want to, want to do a wedding you pay a certain er amount of money then, then when you break the wedding you refund the money to your husband. Yes, this is, this is, this er Who's picking up Laura's point which is that you get all the contractual arrangements er er done, but I mean it doesn't mean you can't have the ritual, be it dressed with, you know, er a long But red dress with my my complaint is that mostly pom-poms for the groom or it's, it's the pomp and circumstance and and the fluffy lace and everybody being really happy and I know people think about it, but it's not seen as that, it's seen as a a, a family society thing, it's not two people sitting Mm. down and saying right, we're gonna buy a house, we're gonna have kids, have we thought about how many kids we're gonna have? Have we thought about whether we want to have kids at all? Maybe those are the questions we should asking, rather than you know, do you take this man for your husband. Mhm. When you come from a big family, as I do, erm yo you can have any size of wedding as long as the right people are there, anybody gets excluded it's er to be horrendous! Mm. Starts with you know, I haven't been invited why I'm and if you've got a big family, you really have to do it properly and it, it's gonna cost! Well a variety of views and I think the only generalization I can make about weddings is that you can't generalize about weddings, some people think they're wonderful, some people are sceptical, people have done their own er variations on weddings. I haven't really asked you very many questions so I'll, I'll ask you a question which sets us up for a programme we might do in the next series, having discussed the wedding, next the honeymoon! Here's the question. Is a honeymoon a good way to start a marriage? Button one for yes, and button two for no. You don't have to have had one to be able to comment on this. And, seventy seven people say yes, and twenty three people say no, and aren't you fascinated to know why they voted that way? You'll have to watch the next series. From us, here, goodnight. helps me to sort of see how the lesson's going. Right. So that's maths is it. How do you feel about last week's? Erm it was good, I made a lot of progress in it. . Compared to usual. Yeah. Yeah. That that's how I felt, that you were getting into it, you were understanding how the bits tied together Yeah. and making sense of it. So you're feeling happier with it? Yeah a lot better. Okay. Erm what you done since last time? Erm I did that work you asked me to do. Great. Great. And did it make sense? Sort of yeah. I was a bit Okay. it it got away a bit you know and and This this is what I'm saying last time that if you'll work through it, understand it, Oh yeah I can do that, Yeah. but if you if you if that's all you do then in eve even a week's time but definitely in a few months' time it's just gone. You'll just have this vague memory that, Ooh I could do that once, now where d how do I get started? Yeah. How do I get into it? So you need the practice. Erm been tending to concentrate on specific things which you know stand a good chance of being on the paper, and even if they're not will help you with others. So how much of it did you understand? Erm Which bits were you happy with? the positive and the negative. Okay. Erm So from your table you could find out Yeah. there's a good chance that one of the positives will go with one of those negative Yeah. and you can make something out of it. Right. Now what what were the bits that were a bit tricky then? Erm just remembering say I had to put four O Hs with N H, I was sometimes I was getting it right sometimes I was getting it wrong and stuff like that . Right, so for the for the diagram It was just where I was putting the four I wasn't sure about. Yeah. The diagram was okay. What was physically happening you could relate to that and you got that sorted out. Now how do you put it down on paper? What's the notation? That Yeah. that's the only problem, okay? Yeah. So you're understanding it. You could explain that to me. Yeah. Yeah, you could say what it looked like and what was happening and then say, Well I'm not quite sure what the convention is for writing them Right. down. Well that's fine. I mean the convention is each of these ex I mean what you could have, you could put brackets round everything. . If you think of maths you can you can put brackets in where you don't need them can't you? Yeah. So you could put there. If I wanted to do something like three add six I could put brackets round the three and round the six and it wouldn't make any difference. Erm if I put two times brackets three add six it does make a difference. Mhm. Yeah? Mm. It makes a big difference. Well it's the same with this. If you put something like N H and then O H four well the convention is that when it's a suffix stuff a subscript and a suffix below the line there and just after it,it only applies to the last element. Yeah. Usually mean the last letter cos most of the elem well a lot of the le the elements have one letter. So that would just be four Hs and one O. Right. To make it mean that you've got four Os as well you put it in brackets. So with the maths it's like it's the difference between four times O H or just sort of O plus four H four O plus H. So anything that you've got four of put a bracket round it. Right. Erm if we had something like erm N H four and we had something with a valency of eight, say, which is impossible Yeah. but we had one with eight so we'd have we'd have the whole thing there twice. So how many Hs would you have in that weird thing? Er eight. Yeah. And how many Ns? One. No eight. Two. Two. So Yeah. anything inside your brackets multiplied by what you've got outside just the way you would have two times brackets three add six close brackets. Okay? Yeah. So it's the same same with this. It's just a slightly different convention but Mm. basically it is maths. It's telling us how many sets of different things we've got. Right. So let's have a look what we've got here. So got N A positive O H negative N H four positive and O H negative now what's going on here? You've got an alkali trying to react with an alkali. Is this is this what you're supposed to be doing? Well that's No wonder you had trouble. Is that what I wrote er right What that's what I wrote but what I said was, Each of the acids reacting with this starting Ah with hydrochloric Okay? One. These these are two these are two common alkalis . Alkalis. Okay there's N A O H which is what? Er sodium hydroxide. Okay. And N H four O H which is? Nitrogen hydroxide no no er Have a look in the tables what N H four is. N H four ammoni Ammonium. ammonium. Okay. N H three on its own ammonia when it's combined with something else it's N H four ion and it's ammonium. Like erm chlorine on its own chlorine combine it with sodium it becomes a chloride. Right. So let's have a look at that now. You shouldn't have any problem with so you've tried there with which acid do you want to use? Hydrochloric's probably the simplest so have a go with that first because then you can see the pattern. Er hydrochloric acid is erm erm no erm ? It's got Erm hydrochloric what does that sound like? Hydrogen and chlorine. Okay. H C L that was it yeah Right I couldn't remember. Okay great. So it's H C L and C L's got a valency of one so that's nicely balanced one C L with one H plus. Erm now you've done that quite a few times before N A O so do the N A O H first and you should be able to whiz through that. Yes. erm So then you can work out which are positive and which are Right. Hydrogen's the one we tend to treat as a a metal. Yeah. Hydrogen is positive. Right. Chlorine is a negative. Er Sodium is a positive. Hydroxide is You've got one here there are some on this Yeah er negative. Right Yeah. So So most of these are one positive and one negative. So the hydrogen with go with hydroxide. Okay making? Erm so that's H two O plus this two H dow there. Yeah where does the two go? Down there. Right. Okay. Two goes down there so it's two what two whatever letter came before it. Yeah. Two Hs and one O. And on the C L we add the so yeah we get sodium C L is a negative N A is is a positive how many that's spare one spare Okay. transfer that's N A C L. Yeah that's it. That's H two O and S O you write the equation out for that now? That's N A C L Erm the sort of Erm. from what you start with from what it gives. From the hydrochloric acid and the Oh right. H C L plus N A O H is equal to N A C L Right yeah. plus H two O. Right great. So what's the sort of general term for this, this is an Hydrogen chloride. Yeah er what about this then? Sodium hydroxide. And it's an example of what? An alkali. Okay this is? Er acid. So you can just write under it acid plus acid plus gives equals N A C L is a alkali. Erm No it's not it's a salt. Good it's a salt. And you know what and water. Right and that's a general reaction that happens with virtually any acid and any alkali acid and any alkali salt and water. Er so have another go now at a similar sort of reaction. Same acid this time use a different alkali. Use ammonium hydroxide. Which is ammonium N H four usually put the acid first Right the acid and what acid gonna use? So use the same one. So H C L plus ammonium hydroxide that's N H Now it's got four spare ones and the hydroxide has got Er whoa whoa whoa now it's N H four right Yeah. so put the put the four on for N H four. Now if you look it up on the table let's have a look at erm say calcium double positive. Right zinc double positive this this type of ion Triple positive. is a triple positive. But N H four so it's a single positive. Oh right. Okay? Yeah. So It's four hydrogen with the Four hydrogen one nitrogen all their bonds got get together and there's one the result is one positive bond left over. Right. Okay you're not too bothered about what's going on internally So it's N H four O H So N H four O H because it's it's just one positive on that whole N H four cluster and we we think of that as an entity. That's a positive that's a negative er that's a positive that's a negative. Mhm. So the positive the negative Yeah that's good. and the negative the positive. That's it tha I like the way you did it because that's a good one to do first the H positive and the O H negative are going to give you the water. Now what are you left over with? it's a nice nice that for working it through. So that put the equals underneath so H so the chlorine and the N H four chlorine has got one spare one Right. and so's N H four so it's N H four C L. Right. Small L's don't forget. Oh yeah. Plus Okay so just write the equation out again. No need to write acid plus alkali Okay. Now try do you remember the formula for sulphuric acid? Sulphuric acid erm Yeah I will do now. Okay or nitric if that's easier whichever one Yeah. comes first. Erm N A O H no that's sodium hydroxide The ones ending in O H Yeah. are the alkalis Yeah. Okay. The acids all start with I know it it's just that with an H Yeah. well you know we put the H first. H two S O four. Brilliant. Okay? Yeah. So H two S O four right before we go any further with that H two S O four how many Hs in it? Two. And how many Ss? One. Good. One S. If we'd put brackets round Four Os. the whole lot and then a four down there it would have been four but four Os only one S. Right. Okay. Plus erm plus you could do ammonium erm now let's have a calcium erm hydroxide. Calcium that's C A two plus C A and that's a double positive Right so so I'm gonna need two hydroxide. Two hydroxides cos they're just a single negative. Which is O H. O H now how many of those do you want? In brackets. Great. And there are two. Right right. you got the the O H is the bit you want twice so write it down put the brackets round it and then the two. Right. Hydrogen is positive. Right. So that's positive. The sulphur sulphoxide Sulphate. sulphate is a double negative. Yeah sulphoxide was a good sort of And then I'm I'm a bit Any of the 'ates any of the 'ates have got oxygen in Yeah. in as well. So nitrate has got nitrogen and oxygen in it. The calcium is a double positive. And the O H is a that'll be a double negative cos there's two of them No Well now no no no no cos they're joined together that'll be a single negative . O H O H is is a single negative but keep it inside the bracket that's it and don't forget the two applies to everything inside there so Yeah. we'll finish up with two negatives one from each O H. So hydrogen Right. reacts with the O H. Yeah. And the S O four reacts with C A the calcium. So hydrogen there's two of this hydroxide. Two hydroxides so if you just write twice just write O H negative and then another O H negative. Yeah H two er no yeah I need H two O H mm no two H two O. Brilliant. Two H two O yeah. What we've got if you write them out separately Yeah. just to show what's happening. What have we got we've got two lots of H positive okay there's one H positive and there's another H positive. Yeah. They're two separate it's H positive times two. What have we got here O H negative times two. Two lots of O H negative. Right now we're just back onto what we were doing here. One H positive one O H negative gives you the H two O we've got two lots of that so we're going to get two H two O. Mhm. And you've even and you've even balanced the equation as you've done it. And then what's left over. Right. Two H two O and now we've got the sulphate and the calcium. Mhm. And they're both double negative and double positive . That's right. So it's C A S O four. . So that's that's something that you've never done before an equation you've st perhaps never even heard of calcium sulphate. But just from that little table which you'll get used to as work through them, you can work what would happen. So you can Mm. work out what would happen for any of the any of the acids with any of the alkalis . Mm. Erm do you want to try another one? Yeah yeah . Yeah. It's the the the time to do another one is when you think, Oh yeah there's no problem here I've definitely got this. then it's a good idea just to do another one and make sure. Okay sh so erm let's try mm say stay with erm sulphuric acid, so sulphuric acid plus erm Sulphuric er yeah. Sulphuric acid plus what shall we have out of this lot. Erm how about ammonium erm hydroxide. H H two S O four Yeah. plus what was it again? erm Ammonium hydroxide. Ammonium N H four er O H Right. I know that's a positive that's a double negative the N H four a positive and that is a negative. So again the H two and the O H Right. make er H two O Okay. H O plus What have you got left over? the S O four and the N H four that's a double negative and that's a single positive it's going to be two N H four S O four no erm let me think about it again er what's wrong with S O four N H two N H four. It's you you were Yeah. you were right the first time. Right. So it's N H four Two N H four I said. You're going to have two lots of N H four right. Let's let's say we were doing Right now what do you mean by that? What does this two apply to? Erm the N H four so brackets Let's with the two afterwards. Right brilliant. So S O four bracket N H four two. Right so it's the right way round N H four N H four twice so N H four two S O four. S O four. Right. Erm when you put two H two O what did you mean?two H two O wherever it was there it is. Two waters. Yeah and how many hydrogens all together? Er one oh no two four hydrogens. And how many oxygens? Two. Right so if you put the number in front, it's as though you've got brackets around the whole lot. I mean Mm. really you should have brackets round the whole lot but we don't bother to put them. Yeah. should do it's a bit sloppy in the notation convention. So if you just wanted two hydrogens when you put it down here. If you just wanted two N H fours you'd put it down here. Okay? Yeah. So I think you've definitely got that Right. very well on that. Erm nitrates, sulphates and what else any other 'ates that you've heard of? Erm nitrates, sulphates Okay now just stick with those . I'm just think I I'm just thinking. Don't worry. Er There's there's one in there. Yeah I'm just thinking . another ate. And it's not it's not the same as these as these it's not Chlorate. Chlorate yes there is a chlorate. Erm there's one down there. Carbonate. Carbonate which is not quite the salt not the sort of thing you get from an acid normally like sulphuric, sulphuric acid give you the sulphate. What's the special thing about carbonates and acids? I mean is a carbonate erm an alkali? Erm no. What happens when you drip an acid on a carbonate? Don't know. Do you know any carbonates? Are you warming up? I'll just I'll just So what happens when you drip acid onto a carbonate? Do you know any carbonates. Not really no. Well I probably do but. Okay er have you come across calcium carbonate? Yeah. What's that look like? Erm Is it normally a solid or a liquid or what? a liquid? No no erm it's a solid. Okay, what sort of rocks have you come across? Erm erm marble chippings. Marble chippings okay so what happens when you drip acid onto marble chippings? Er you told me last week remember but I can't remember. Er have you ever seen it done? No. Er I may have been absent or something . Right okay. What often happens when you drip acids onto things? They react. React maybe it's carbonates they Effervesce Yeah effervesce they fizz a bit. What's happening? Er they're producing gas they're giving off Okay what gas? Carbon dioxide. Right. Mm. So acid plus carbonate gives? Er carbon dioxide. Right and probably a few other things. Yeah. Let's see if we can work out what it is. So let's pick a nice simple acid. The choice is yours. Erm Which is the easiest one to play with? H C L. Yeah H C L good choice plus and we'll pick an easy carbonate, er we'll pick the one that we normally use calcium carbonate. Which is C A erm and carbonate is C O three C A C O now that's a positive negative the calcium is a double positive double nega positive yeah. And the C O three is a double negative. Right. Right hydrogen and the carbonate so there's going to be H brackets two C O three yeah? Okay well maybe maybe. It's a good try. Erm the chlorine and the calcium it's a double positive Er Ah you remembering anything? Go on carry on I could write two H C O three Erm well what's the difference between H two C O three and Er two H C O three. that's two of H C O three . Right right H two is just two of H. Right so there i they're not the same compound at all. You can't just No no . swap one for the other. So what's what's happening with the chlorine then? Er two C A yeah. Okay. Now we usually write the metal first. Yeah. So we'd have calcium chloride Yeah so I'll rearrange it Okay how would you write that? Just rearrange that. Right Okay well that's quite possibly what does happen. Now go to the C L, it's just one element, we don't need the brackets it wouldn't be wrong to write the brackets round it but we don't usually bother. No. You can just write C A C L two Right. for that. Now this thing H two C O three erm so you've tried the reaction, you've tried these different compounds Mm. pull 'em apart shove 'em back together again see what you can make. And you've made this thing, hydrogen carbonate Yeah. and calcium chloride. The calcium chloride's definitely going to get formed. But we decided that you get carbon dioxide. Oh yeah. Right so maybe this is an intermediate stage, we don't know but we know carbon dioxide comes out of it. What would happen if you took carbon dioxide out of this? What' do Mhm. you know the formula for carbon dioxide? Er di is two isn't it? Right good. So it's carbon which is C Right. C O two. Okay so just re write C O two underneath it. C O two. Now if you took C O two out of that, what would you have left? You're left with H two O er so it's Right. H two O plus C O three plus C O two . Right Yeah. Yeah. plus C A C L two. No you don't need the brackets Yeah. it's better without the brackets they'd probably accept it with. Okay so this was worked out not really knowing anything about what's going on here we've got that and that go together what would happen well pretty good bet that you'd get this calcium chloride cos that seems to form pretty easily. Mhm. the other reactions we've had. calcium hydroxide hydrogen chloride you get calcium chloride formed and you got this thing well it's quite likely that this does form initially, but it doesn't last very long and it's not very stable and it Right. splits up splits up into carbon dioxide and water. Mm. Erm and that's it we've sorted out the reaction. So just going back to these 'ates, sulphate has got sulphur and oxygen in it, a carbonate has got what? Er carbon and and oxygen. A nitrate has got? Nitrogen and oxygen. Now a chloride Chlorine and Just the the metal and the chlorine so sodium chloride would just be N A and then C L. Chlorate would have Chlorate yeah chlorine and oxygen. That's it so there is a system behind all these weird names Yeah. there's a bit of a system. Erm once you sort of crack the code and get into it, things you've never heard of when they come up you when you know the system you think, Oh well I know what I know what it means by that. So if someone said erm bromate or bromide say what's the difference between calcium bromide and calcium bromate, what the difference be? Bromide is just the bromine with the Yeah. metal, bromate is bromine with the oxygen. Good so it might be it might be something like B R O three or B R O or B R O two something like but it would have oxygen to go with it. So you're building up now I think a good understanding of the er terminology Right. and a good understanding of the the systems and putting these numbers in the equations. Yeah. So as you feel happier with that, you'll b more able to play with them. But unless you do play them forget it again . exactly, it'll be cos we looked at this last week as you said at the end what happens dripping acid onto onto chips now the things to know about acids,bases and salts. A metal plus an acid what happens? A metal and plus an acid. Drip metal onto an acid I'm sorry acid onto a metal . Right. think that might be a bit difficult er It might be a bit awkward if you it might be highly reactive if you dropped molten metal onto it. Erm it reacts and produces carbon dioxide. Mm would it, no a metal with an acid. It's a metal erm Erm it effervesces. Right so there's a gas given off which is? Carbon dioxide Hydrogen. Okay right so there's a s there's a system to what's going on with the acids and it's not just one acid like hydrochloric most of the acids will do it some of them do it very readily some of them you have to get the conditions right often you have to get the temperature high to make it to make the reaction go but a metal plus an acid erm there's a typical one zinc H two S O four gives zinc sulphate and the hydrogen. Yeah. And you can think of that pretty easily if you look at your table erm just write down with the charges on the the ions what H two S O four looks like. H two S O four. right erm what's the charge on that H? Positive. Right good. Er double negative. Yeah great how did you work that out? Er the Hs are positive. Right. Yeah and there's two of it so that Good so that was I like that because you worked it out you didn't look it with table you Yeah. Good. So it's H two S O four plus erm a metal erm chose zinc then shall we try it no we'll use zinc. Yeah. have you got it in here? No. No. Okay we'll use erm Yeah zinc ion Right. Z N two plus. Right. thought it should be in there cos it's normally Okay now all that happens here if you if you think of it going back to the picture with the the magnets or the electrostatic charges or or bonds whatever you like to think of it . Yeah. You've got an S O four with two bonds on it and it's holding on to a hydrogen Yeah. in each one. And the zinc comes along and pushes the hydrogen out, it says, Hang on I want that sulphate. Yeah. and it displaces the hydrogen and that we that's why we describe it the the zinc displaces the hydrogen from the acid. So zinc sulphate gets formed the zil the zinc just goes in in place of that H two. So it becomes Z N S O four. And the two Hs that got pushed out H two yeah? Yeah. H two and the charge erm now ah ah hang on yeah this is this one is a bit tricky because that is not a zinc ion that's zinc just on its own so it's just Z N. Right. Erm it wants to be a Z N double positive and go with the sulphate Yeah. if you like so it pinches the two positive charges off the hydrogen cos in these equations the charges must must balance as well so that if you just cross the double positive out you need to you can't write it in but you need to remember that it wants to become a double positive given Yeah. the chance. So the zinc comes along pushes the hydrogen out takes its two charges off it as well Right. and you're left with H two. So that's the first sort of reaction with with acids. A metal plus an acid and most of the metals and most of the acids'll give you hydrogen. Some of them you remember the table we had a long time ago showing the reactivity of different elements, particularly the metals when we were looking at metals. Erm some metals are much more reactive than others. I mean some some metals with an acid a fairly weak acid will give you hydrogen, some metals will give you hydrogen just with s water, or with steam. And some of them it's it's hard to get them to go so but in general any of the fairly reactive acids and any of the fairly reactive metals they're going to give you a salt and hydrogen. So metal plus acid gives you a salt and hydrogen. And you can do that. Then we've got a base plus an acid, what's the difference again between a base and an alkali? A base Mm. is neutral no a base Is an alkali a base? Yeah. Yeah okay. A base So what's so special about an alkali that's not quite a special about a base. Erm erm An alkali is a base but a base isn't an alkali. Hey? Yeah. Erm an alkali is contained in the base family but it's got a special property. Erm It's a fairly simple physical property actually but they're they're soluble. Right. So Mm. But this thing we've been doing with an acid and an alkali, most of the bases will do it as well, Yeah. so let's try that one. Now the base is erm most of the oxides are bases the metal oxides so what would magnesium oxide look like? And what's going to happen if we get it to react with H two S O four? So try that one H two S O four plus magnesium oxide what's that going to be? M G Oxide Is? So that's a double positive a double negative that's a positive double negative so H two and the O so that's gonna be that'll be a double positive because there's two of it wouldn't it? It's it's well Yeah. Erm You wouldn't write it like that but you'd write it as a single positive okay now because there's a two But because there's two of it down there you've got two Yeah. negative two positive That's hooks on it H two O plus S O four erm that's a double negative so the goes there so magnesium M G S O four Let's have a look. Oh that's a shame. What? was going to say check it in the book but I gave you wrong one. Never mind. Okay I'll do the other one Okay check it yeah okay try the other one then. Erm an easier one in fact. Erm magnesium oxide with hydrochloric acid. M G oxide which is O right with Hydrochloric acid. H C L and that's a double positive Right. double negative. Good. That's a single positive Right. that's a negative. Right. Right. And what's going to happen what was the first way you can see. Magnesium chloride Well try the the one you tried in the first equation Oh yeah. we did. Oxygen and a hydrogen. Right so what have we get we've got one O negative So that'll be H O erm two O. Yeah that's the H two O. Where did the two Hs come from you've only got one there? Er you'll add another. Okay put a put a two in front now. And what's that going to give you? Two that's going to become a double. So it's going to give you two Hs and two C Ls . Two C Ls so that'll be H two O plus magnesium chlorine so that's a M G C L two Brilliant go on see if that's well I'm saying so see if that's what it gives in the book. M G O It just says it's aqueous but but I mean when it when it when it happens Yeah. because magnesium chloride is soluble it'll be dissolved in the water and you'll finish up with a solution of magnesium chloride. That's it so metal and acid gives what? A metal and an acid gives erm er water and This is the one that doesn't give water. Oh yeah er What did the zinc do to the hydrogen? Carbon dioxide and Hang on hang on metal and acid say think of the zinc and which acid was it we used H two S O four, what did the zinc do to the hydrogen? Er it pinched its good go on it what did it do? Right it pinched its positives its electrons. Right it pinched its place and it pinched its charge, it displaced it it pinched it out of its nice cosy relationship So you get hydrogen. and it liberated the hydrogen okay. So that's an acid plus a metal, now an acid plus a base which is this one we've just done, a metal oxide the metal oxides are bases, er you can think of them as being alkaline, we call it basic but very very similar sort of thing to alkaline okay so what happens with a base and an acid? With a base and an acid Well what happens with an acid and an alkali? Er acid and alkali er it gives a water and sal. Right great and what happens what seems to be happening with a base and an acid or an acid and a base? Erm gives off hydrogen ah no gives off It gives you well this is erm this is one that you did here. It gives off water. This is one you did here yeah you get water and? Er er the metal chloride magnesium chloride in this case in this case you got a chloride if you'd used sodium you would have got sodium chloride which is? Er Oh right salt. So this is magnesium chloride is also a? Er salt. Right so we tried couldn't eat it though. acid and a base Mm. acid and a base and we get salt and water, try alkali and a base you get salt and water so they're very similar reaction, the base and the acid and the alkali and the acid. They're the same sort of thing they're neutralizing each other. And the other one with the carbonate what happened then? The one you Er. worked out yourself. The carbon which one was that? erm cos there's so many of them now I'm getting a bit I know and I'm trying to pile them up now and let you see the patterns so these The carbonate I can't remember what it is I'm getting confused I okay Right you mentioned it a few minutes ago you suggested that this thing was formed. Which one wa I I can't remember what I sa I was saying a f a lot of things a few minutes ago . Right okay okay carbonate. What's the er what's the symbol for carbonate? Er C C C C C O? Yeah C O? Two. Three. Three yeah. C O three and what did you take out of that? An O no C ah Let's go back to where you did it here. What you did was you tried H C L plus calcium carbonate. Yeah. Okay and you sorted this out very nicely what was going to happen and what you'd have left over. Right so you got your calcium chloride out and then you got this H two C O three. Which we said do left over. Erm er carbon dioxide. Right so you looked at this H C L plus C A C O three quite messy. Yeah. What can we get out of this? Mm can't see any water there can't see any H and O H. Yeah. But there's our old friend calcium chloride right. Yeah. You take calcium chloride out, what have you got left? You've got this H two C O three. Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Hi some refreshment. Lovely. Don't tell me you don't like them. There's not a lot is there? Do you what more? You've you've been scratching then? Oh useless. Come on Charlie out. go on out out Out. out. he said he can't hear you with that on Yeah he can. Right. Got an ear problem? Erm well he split his tail the end of it. Yeah I saw his tail was bandaged. So we had the end cut off and to stop him ripping the bandages off we Ah. wrapped it up. Mm. The vet wrapped it up but he also had a little thing on his ear so he cut that out as well and he's gonna wear the collar to stop him scratching his ear and to stop him biting his tail. cos he's been in a fight has he No erm it was just it was just like a little er spot on his o occupy about three hundred square miles, and this is what three hundred square miles looks like er it's, it's the major part of, of central L you wouldn't put them in central London of course but erm gives you some idea of the sort of area you'd have to devote to wind farms if you were to use this particular type of er of energy. Erm so there are these other forms of energy as well, erm nuclear power er will take its place along those, alongside those I'm sure in the future er it does have its problems, the main problem is the possibility of er major accidents and many of you will remember the accident at Chernobyl in the, what was then the Soviet Union, it's now the, now the er Ukraine erm when in nineteen eighty six the, there was a very serious accident and the er roof er blew off and er radioactivity was pumped into the er atmosphere. Very serious accident indeed er two people died from falling masonry er in fact one of the bodies is still in there somewhere, they haven't found him yet and twenty nine people died from large doses of radiation erm erm and others will die prematurely because of the large radiation dose that they got, mainly the emergency workers who went in to erm sort out the er er the problem. Erm what's happened to that? There we go. Ra radiation is potentially harmful, er particularly in large doses. Erm this shows the er affect of radiation against er dose er ten thousand units is, is er fairly le is, is lethal you'd die within minutes if you got that sort of dose of radiation. Down at about a thousand units erm you er b between ten thousand and a thousand units er you'd suffer the symptoms of radiation sickness erm your hair would drop out and your teeth would drop out and you'd vomit and your skin would turn a funny shade of green and and you'd be very ill erm but you, you'd probably recover er you might not but you, you, I mean people have actually had those sort of doses of radiation and have actually recovered er from it. So there's, there's a chance you'd recover in that, in that range, though you will be ill for a while. Lower than a thousand units er there's no immediate affect and one's tempted to think that erm the er er it's, that radiation's therefore safe below that level and that's not strictly true because there is the possibility of a long term affect it can actually cause cancer in the long term but with very low er ra- er levels of risk cos you can see down at the levels where people actually get radiation doses er like erm members of the public or erm from the actual background of people who work in nuclear power stations, you're talking about very low levels but the levels, those sort of levels I mean one in three hundred thousand, one in three million, that sort of thing you can't actually measure in real er populations because there er any effects that there are can be swamped by other ways of getting er of getting cancer. Er in fact most of the radiation we get in fact is not from nuclear power, it's from erm man made sourc it's from, from natural sources eighty seven percent of the population as an average comes from our natural environment a lot comes from radon gas erm a small amount of radioactivity in our food erm we were discussing at er er lunch in, in fact the benefits of, of eating er low sodium salt salt is meant to be bad for you so the health er er er freaks say and it's the sodium, therefore you should buy low sodium salt which is calcium chloride rather than sodium chloride what they forget to tell you of course is that potassium er sorry it's, it's potassium chloride rather than er than s than sodium chloride, what they forget, forget to tell you of course is that potassium is slightly radioactive it contains erm a small amount of, of a naturally occurring radioactive potassium so you get a small dose of radiation er to compensate for the fact you aren't eating any sodium. Erm a small amount of, of erm radiation from cosmic rays from outer space and from building materials and so on er eighty seven percent in total of average. Of the man made er sources of radiation, twelve of the thirteen percent you see are from medical uses from X-rays, that kind of thing, and only one percent comes from all the others, of which point one percent comes from nuclear er installations. So erm er erm by n by no means er could you call one point one percent of something that can vary by factors of three in, in, in, in Cornwall the natural radiation is three times what it is in, in Essex erm er but they seem to be quite er healthy nevertheless in Cornwall erm so point one percent is er varies by factors of three, obviously can't be considered to be erm er a major political er a major erm er environmental hazard. The problem of course arises, as I've said earlier, when things go wrong, things like Chernobyl accidents and so on so we've gotta use nuclear power obviously we have to erm er make sure that we don't have accidents like that. I'll just finish with, with a er er er a small anecdote to show erm the relative affects of radiation compared to other things. You, you, you've all hea heard of Marie Curie, famous erm scientist who pioneered a lot of the work on radioactivity in the early part of this century and the last part of the last century she in fact was Polish, lived in, in, in Paris, married a French man called Pierre er hence she's known as Marie Curie well Pierre Curie was also a scientist and he was er baffled by the affect that,th the fact that there didn't seem to be any biological affects er certainly the doses of radiation that, that they were, they were getting they'd handled tons and tons of pitchblende, that's radioactive ore they extracted several grammes of radium from it, they'd been handling stuff for years they weren't ill, they obviously hadn't died and so on. So he, he thought he'd do an experiment, er he took a small piece of radium which he'd extracted from several tons of pitchblende and he put this bit of radium on his forearm and, and put a bandage round to hold it in place and left it there for a week and said right I'll see what happens. So after a week he takes away the bandage, removes the bit of radium, sure enough there's a bright red radiation burn on his forearm but apart from that he feels fine, he doesn't feel ill, he obviously hasn't died, er so he said well I'll leave that for a few weeks and monitor my, my health and see if there's any long term affects from this exposure to, to radiation. But we shall never know the results of that experiment because the very next week he was run over and killed by a bus erm which all goes to show that yes, you know in large doses radiation can be harmful to you, er but in the sort, the sort of levels that you and I are likely to come across er almost certainly something else will get you first. Thank you gentlemen. Gentlemen I'm sure there must be questions. Would anybody like to start the ball? Don Yes a after Chernobyl there was a certain amount of alarm about erm about hill farms, Cumberland and so forth and it's all gone quiet now, can you update us on what exactly Yeah. Yes what er happened,th there was erm erm er the radioactive cloud that came up was swept by the winds around the world and in fact as it went over the United Kingdom er it happened to rain on er Cumbria and North Wales so some of this radioactivity was brought down, it settled on the grass and got into the soil. Erm and the hill er farmers who graze their sheep up there there are very strict regulations about the amount of radioactivity that you're allowed to have in any meat and in, in, in sheep it's erm er er about ten thousand units er per kilogramme. That's the, the, the internationally approved level. Well in Britain we decided we'd be on the safe side, we'll reduce that to a thousand we put another factor of ten in and what's more i if one sheep in, in a whole flock is more than a thousand units, er then we will condemn the whole flock. So it's pretty, it's pretty er er and in fact some of these, these flocks who were grazing at the er w where just above that er that limit only just but just slightly above it so, so but in fact i if the farmers er grazed their sheep er further down the hillside er then in fact the, the er er the level dropped very rapidly and the sheep were then erm so it was a, a commercial decision as to whether to keep your sheep up on the hills to, to eat radioactive grass and get the compensation or to graze your sheep further down and actually the, the lamb the, the, the lambs for, for, for for the market. Erm s so er because obviously these hill farmers were compensated for, for the loss of, of sales. As far as I know, er the levels have now dropped and I don't think there are any further restrictions, as far as I know. But it was just on the, on the margin er er o o of something that was already a large factor below the international limit, so it was er there were very large safety factors involved in that in fact. Er Frank Yes thank you Mr President erm we worry about our, our stations though I don't think we've got very many in fact but within reach, within twenty five miles across the Channel there are probably ten or twenty French power stations that could cause just as much trouble as any of ours surely? And any fallout from them would affect most of the southern half of England I think, is this true? Yeah er the, the French erm have a very large nuclear programme er for, for a good erm logical gallic reasons, I mean they've got no oil, they've got no gas, they've got no coal, so they decided, oh years and years ago in the nineteen fifties, to have a very large nuclear programme. Seventy five percent of their electricity comes from nuclear power in France. And that will rise to ninety percent early in the next century. Er so they actually got themselves organized and they erm have factories that, that er mass produce the components and they're producing nuclear power stations at the rate of about one every six months. And, and erm because it's all mass produced er they can actually build a nuclear power station for half the price that we can that obviously has an effect on the economics. And when they sited their power stations, they decided erm, again for good economic reasons, to site them er along the channel coast and actually down the, down the Rhine most of the power stations are, are er th they have power stations elsewhere but a lot of the power stations are in these areas here and the reason for that was, by putting it near to their borders, they were able to export electricity to their neighbours. Er they were banking on the fact that there'd be problems for other countries because of, you know, public perception etcetera, you know the French had decided almost all of them decided they'd have a nuclear programme anyway so, so, so they were er o okay. Er so a lot of their power stations are actually built near borders for that reason, they're, they, they, they, they make a lot of money by exporting nuclear electricity across the border to Germany, into Switzerland, to Belgium, to Holland and of course, through this,the these couple of cables under the channel, to Britain. So in fact five percent of our electricity comes from French nuclear power stations, in fact at the present time. Er but yes wh what happens if there's er er an accident? Erm the French erm safety record is extremely good. Erm we've had a, a major accident in nineteen fifty er ninety fifty seven, one of the Winscale small reactors at Winscale caught fire er the Americans had an accident at Three Mile Island which erm w was catastrophic as far as the reactor was concerned, but the safety devices prevented any radioactivity escaping the Russians have had their Three Mile I er their erm Chernobyl accident which was catastrophic. Er the French, despite the size of their programme, erm haven't had any serious incidents at all, in fact they they're very well run er stations. So erm yes there is the risk that the French, one of the French power stations could go wrong and it would affect southern England. Erm but er certainly the record to date has been that these power stations are erm extremely erm well run and that they ha they've had no major incidents at all. Yes there's always the possibility that it might. But then of course France is a, is a, is a separate country and we can't actually tell the French what to do. Er we could refuse to buy their electricity off them I suppose but it wouldn't be have much affect. But if you can actually influence the French let us know because, or let the government know, because they, they've been trying for years ever since Napoleon's day, to try and do something. I mean we Mitterand and take him down to the I suppose, see if that'll do any good but erm erm you know the each, I mean, basically we are, we are a world of a hundred or so independent sovereign states and each sovereign state can do what it wishes within its territory with the exception of Iraq of course er for, for other reasons. But I mean erm er which means basically that er if, if a country wants to build a nuclear power programme er they ha they, they can do so. And most countries with nuclear power programmes are, are pa er er are, subscribe to the International Atomic Energy Agency which sets international standards er and they have inspectors who, who er check these standards are being observed. Er and of course France is a member, we're a member, in fact all the nuclear c countries with nuclear power st er programmes are members. Which er gives some sort of erm er comfort that in fact the international standards are being maintained. The French are a fairly responsible people after all er er with, with reason a reasonable standard of technology. And certainly they're record to date has been better than ours so erm maybe we should Gentlemen I'll just take one last question, Gordon Yeah in today's press it says that er the government are going to subsidize now the coal industry something like seven hundred millions due to the miners' kerfuffle, which is going to mean between five and ten pounds subsidy per ton. Now it also goes on to say that's going to affect electricity prices which will rise, now how will that compensate with, with nuclear electricity? Erm well it depends erm the, the economics of power production are extremely erm er complex and, and t to a certain extent arbitrary erm and erm I mean there, there are various ways that the government can actually get out of this fix because obviously it's caused a lot of concern to close the, the mines, and one is actually to, to subsidize the mines and put the price on to electricity bills er the other is to subsidize the mines er but pay for it out of the, out of, er out of taxes so it's a basic, instead of paying for it on your electricity bill, you pay for it on your tax bill, yeah. A and the, the justification for doing this would be that in the long term we will need the coal therefore it's ne it's necessary to keep er a viable coal industry going. Er er er th that's a fairly logical argument in fact. Erm it's one that is er different from the normal philosophy of this government which tends to er work on er relatively short term economic forces, let the market sort things out is, is, is generally their philosophy. So it would mean actually going against their, their philosophy. Erm the nuclear industry also has erm er a subsidy, it's known as the nuclear levy erm and there is reasons for that erm one is that erm some money has to be put aside to decommission nuclear power stations in the future erm now the s C G B, before it was broken up, had been actually putting some money aside year by year yeah ou ou out of the money that was generated fr er er from selling electricity nuclear power stations, some was put to one side, notionally,o on the accounts f f for a future decommissioning. Now when the C G B was broken up, that money just disappeared. I mean nobody pinched it, it er actually just went into the general melting pot. So that national er budget that had been accumulating over, over twenty thirty years just basically vanished. Er so that had to be, that had to be re replenished essentially with, with, with other money. Erm so erm th the cheapest er fuel at the moment is gas, you know, that's, that's why er a lot of the erm er er generators are now moving to towards gas er erm er generation er wh which is fine for as long as the gas exists but, you know, another, give it another ten fifteen years, and our North Sea gas will have gone you see so, so erm you have to ask well how much do you, weight do you put on market forces and how much in say, in the energy business, ought you to be thinking longer term? And that's really a political question. Thank you Ian. Could I ask Rotarian Jeff please to propose a vote of thanks. Right erm regarding being a Lancastrian I think the er the main for coming down to the south is probably where you are today, I mean, cricket is the great game that we all follow here no doubt you've come down to watch some decent cricket. I won't say too much about the football cos Manchester United are on top. Erm ironically I was one of those that went from Essex to Manchester and I did live up there for a couple of years but er decided to come back. Erm personally, er on the nuclear er atomic side, we we're very involved with our own company, with B N F L at Sellafield, with the er manufacture of the precast concrete and, and I know what it means in terms of the, the safety incurred in in, in the design because it is quite erm er strenuous the things we have to go through. I'm going back to the erm controversial emotive subject of atomic power I suppose, as you said earlier,the the atomic bomb and erm I suppose the most worrying thing for er for everybody was when erm the Cuba crisis was on and everybody was just waiting for these mushrooms to appear over London because we all thought we were gonna be bombed at any time but er obviously the other thing that sort of worries people is other things that you said about Chernobyl and Three Mile Island but on the other side, obviously the erm the low cost of atomic power must be the advantage for the future. Obviously not being aware that there's er a population of eight billion forecast for the year two thousand and erm obviously with the natural resources of erm gas and coal running out and the, the pollution problems you've got with coal and obviously the great efficiency of sixty times more efficient than other forms of power. Er other areas that probably worried people er i is this storage and distribution and how it's gonna affect us and goodness knows what but I think that's been gone into in, in great depth and I'm sure it moves around with great safety. Erm obviously other forms of power er the, the, the water barrage in the Severn erm Estuary and the wind power is, is something but obviously er the thing with this atomic power situation, it's got to be something for the future. Erm I think that's about all I've got to say and I, I'd just like the club to er thank Ian in erm the usual way please Thank you Mr President. Next week we have Rodney , the District Foundation Chairman, and the hosts are Alan and Mike . Thank you gentlemen, I will now close the m meeting by asking you to join me in the the erm Final the final toast. The toast is to Rotary the world over. To rotary the world over. I thank you. Thank you Ian, that was You're welcome obviously very well received and it's very nice to have met Mr can you tell us about er work? Did you get a job as soon as you left school? Yeah. Er I'd be fourteen in the June and we used to have to keep on till the end of the term which was August. And we have four weeks' holiday at August. And when we broke up I, I said, er well that's it now. We all the lads that left at the same time, said, we've got four weeks' holiday before we look for work. So that was alright till we got home. And I said to the old man I says, er well that's it now. I said, I've got four weeks. he said, you bloody haven't, he says, you're gonna look for work. I said, I've, I've got four weeks' holiday before. He says, you're gonna look for work. He was out of work. He couldn't get . So er we used to go through the motions and er after about er three weeks I think it was, no, yeah, two or three weeks anyway. We were going round actually looking for work, not ve very keen but we were, we were looking for it. We'd go to Boots, walk, Boots, and we'd start in, in the meadows in, in , in Street. Then we'd walk up to Boots up Road. We'd walk through the lace market, we'd walk up to, and then we'd walk round to . All in the day. No buses, no bus fare, no nothing. Er any vacancies? No, sorry. Any vacancies? No. It was half-hearted. E eventually I did get a job. In, in Street, just a couple minutes from, from my home. And they said I, I could be an apprentice fitter. And the wages were seven and thruppence a week. So I went home quite pleased, gonna learn a trade, to be a fitter. Quite pleased, went home and er told my dad, I says er I says, I've got a job. He said, good, where at? I said,. He said, what you're gonna do at it? I says, it's er apprentice fitter. He says, how much is a week? And I says, seven and three. He said, that's no good. He says, you can get ten and thruppence at . Good lot of the lads in used to li work at . So he said, you can go and try . And so I went there and they er I eventually got on. At ten and thruppence a week. And that was in the splitting job where you was handling skins, sheep skins. And with the lime and the chemicals that makes your fingers sore, what are called birds eyes. That red raw. You could you couldn't bear them a night time. And you used to wear er er leather I've still got a skin. This or someone else's sister would be they used to give you this to make your . You cut a, a piece out and you'd sew it up, like that you see. That, that sort of thing er you used to wear them to protect, to protect your fingers cos it used to get red raw if you didn't. Anyway I started there, I got the ten and three a week and er eventually not very good, at that time quite a lot of short time. And they didn't have three days on and three days off, you used to go in this particular shop at eight o'clock and maybe finish at half past ten or eleven o'clock because there was no more skins coming through. And what exactly were you doing? Wh what exactly was your job? Splitting. splitting shop. Now that's a sheep skin. You see or it was. The splitting machine, that's one half of a sheep skin, that's the outside. Now the splitting machine used to cut that skin down there like that. Cut it in half then? Split it in two. So you got two skins. Now one half, this would maybe go for clothes, er coats,or . And the other half used to go as a window leather which are called st Chamois Chamois Chamois leather, that's it. Mm. And so you got th two skins out of, out of one sheep. Er one would go one process and another would go the other. Er that was the splitting shop. There was all sorts of processes before it got to that and after it got to that stage. Er And what exactly was your job in the splitting shop then? Well I worked with a man, on a machine. And a we used to get the skin, I used to pick the skin up. Give him one part, now you hold that, I used to hook it on to a roller, tuck it over, pull it through and then you've got it lined up hooked on to a roller. And then he used to bring the knife, there was a knife going like that, a big knife, One about four foot. And th this knife was going like this and the roller was pulling the skin round. And it was pulling, the one that you'd hooked on was pulling that one and the other one going out the back. So you, you, you, that was splitting. Now do you actually remember going to work, the first day you were, you were going to work? The first day yeah, short trousers. Er the first day I didn't stay dinner. home but it was only a few yards anyway from . So eventually we, I, I, I used to get er couple slices of bread, and I used to get thruppence every day. Now I, I'd got all sorts of alternatives to buy. had a pork shop in Street. we'd have a choice of three pennyworth of which were a, which was a big chunk, three pennyworth of , brawn, potted meats, er what else is there ? Three pennyworth of corned beef,er and then you, you, you could go down on to the fish and chip shop in Street. And get er three hap'orth of chips, three hap'orth of fish bits. Which was a good meal, substantial meal you know for thruppence. Now from being at school, enjoying yourself and enjoying yourself, and , and going to work, did you feel differently? Feel? Did you feel differently with working? No I don't think so. Did you enjoy work? Yeah. Funny thing, I've, I've enjoyed every job I've done. And I mean that. Er the splitting shop wasn't, wasn't particularly good I, I'd say. But you were glad to get a job, that were the thing. That made you pleased. But once I got out of the splitting shop out into the dry, handling leather rather than skins, er it were terrific, absolutely terrific. I were in a buffing shop. And the buffing shop used to er get buff that side, make it smooth you know. Well Then I went glazing. How much of a difference to your family did it make that you were working, financially? Well. When I went home a when I was started at ten and thruppence a week, it was a regula regulation in the family that the spending money erm basis, what you got for spending, was a penny in the shilling. Now I earned ten and thruppence, used to take the ten and thruppence home and I used to get tenpence ha'penny spending money. Weren't eleven pence, weren't ten pence, weren't a shilling, tenpence ha'penny. And that was it. Then that went when you're fifteen, I was fifteen I were getting twelve and six. Same again, one shilling and a ha'penny. Not one and a penny, not a shilling. Till I was er I went, I left and went to gun factory. Er . And then when I was eighteen er eighteen, yeah, started paying my board then. Pound a week. Er while you were working did you still try and get sort of like odds and ends and little bits of money? Yeah,wh when you was on short time, ooh yeah. We used to , I've sold card of the match, at, at cricket matches. I've sold cushions at the cricket matches. Quite a few of us from used to go down to cricket match. And motors, when, football mat and reserve matches at , we used to, there were one or two, weren't many cars about then you see. But there was a few. And we could look after cars at the er reserve matches. Now wh while you were working,w w was your father working at this time? No not very often. Very seldom. He did work on er County er Stand, the one that's still there. He, he, he, he did a f a few jobs and, and, and they were nearly all temporary. They didn't last long. Most all, all labouring jobs. And none of them last long you know. You couldn't get a regular job, or he couldn't anyway. And erm did your mother work or was she bringing up the family? My mother used to er whe when we were younger used to come down the for a days' scrubbing, charring. Er she did one or two jobs there. Well, er Was there a lot of erm drinking used to go on in the, in the, in the area at the time? Well you take, to hear, to hear them talk you, you'd think everybody were drunk every night but it wasn't so. Er I've known er one bloke he, he'd send for a pint of Shipstons beer when it was sixpence a pint, and then he'd send for another pint and he'd be drunk, or, or he'd be ready f to fight anybody that wanted to fight him. And there usually was somebody ready to fight him for twelve, especially on a Saturday night . Now Saturday night in Street, we used to call it the waits, Street waits, every Saturday night. You could guarantee that if you waited top of one of those yards that somebody would be fighting or wanted to fight or a window could get broken or, or either men or women. Men and women, they'd just fight each other but women used to have a go,ar argue not f particularly fighting but you know falling out. And, and the men they of often used to have a go. And the lads . Did you have any real characters in th in the ? Oh yes, yeah. I'm not going to name them because of the family, they're dead now. Oh yes, there was one er, he had a knighthood. Er people who, who er who lived do th they'll know, and then the family will know. Cos he, he was Sir, you know. Oh and there was er Why did they used to call him Sir? Well he, he, he used to go to er used to go to the British Legion, every Sunday morning. Now he, he had about he about seven or eight kids I think, he must have done, yeah. Two, three, four, five,, yeah. And in the week, I don't think he was working at the time, but on a Sunday morning he'd walk out of that terrace house and er he'd be immaculate, absolutely. He'd have a walking stick, he'd have a buttonhole, a top hat and a stiff collar, and he'd swing this cane and walk up the street. There goes Sir yes. What reputation did the have with other areas at the time? Was it seen as being a rough place? Did it what? What reputation did the have with other areas of at the time? Was it thought to be rough by everyone else? Oh yes, we had a reputation. Er I'd a lad, a Street,,, that's what it,they used to call us. Er yeah, well you know we were rough because, but I mean if we got into a fight, there we there were no gang warfare. There was a gang of us, but I mean er if one of us got involved with a fight it was him and him. And we used to stand down and leave it at that. No nobody'd interfere. You know, it was a fair fight, there were no kicking. We'd just fight and that was it. and I suppose, I, I well I, I used to go about with a gang but we, we never raided anybody. You know, you, you used to talk about raids and er a black hand gang and all this sort of thing, but we no. If there was any trouble we, we'd fight but one on one. Wouldn't gang up four onto one, five onto one, and, and mugging and noth nothing, none, none of that nonsense. How long wer were you actually at then? Well I started at fourteen and I, I had to leave er when I was fifteen and, no, nearly sixteen. And then I went back at er eighteen until I were twenty, twenty three I think it was. Now why did you leave first time? Got a short time. were only working half days. And where did you go? And what did you do there? I started painting and then I went to be rivet hotter. And then I was rive riveter's mate. I really enjoyed that. Really enjoyed it. Was it what was the differences that you noticed between and ? What, what Different what? What, what, what were the big differences between the two? Well it, it were the variety you got at . You see, er there, there was a riveter, and a holder up, his mate, and a rivet hotter. That's yo that was the team. Now we, we used to build the frame of a coach, Sentinel er Passenger Coach. We used to build all the frame and the roof, riveted, no fitted. Er bolt it together first, and then rivet it after. So all, all the time th th there were different job. Different size rivets, different lengths, and I, while I were hotting hotting I knew where, eventually knew where, what size rivet to put in a certain place. And you used to get them hot ready for, for the rivet for the riveters. And then we'd get onto the roof with the little tiny rivets, quarter inch rivets. And maybe an hour after we'd be on three quarter rivets. Or five eighths or half inch, so you got the variety as well and different jobs to do all day long. And wh why did you leave there? Well it closed down. And how, how did you get back into then? Well er my mother went down the yard, I won't tell you about the other, sister. My mother went down the yard and seen the boss and asked him if he could get and the fact that my mother went down the yard I suppose er he must have felt sorry for us. Anyway I got back and er Was it the same wages? On no, I was older then you see, I was er I was, they sent me straight back into the splitting shop. And within er a week I was told to go into the dry part, handling, in the buffing shop. Er and then I was on my own time in the buffing shop, and I was getting a man's wages. So what, what were you coming out with then? Mm? What, what were you getting then? Er let's see er, around about thirty shillings about thirty, thirty five bob a week. Which were good money for a single fella. Erm now you said you went away, you lived away from home for a bit, when you when you were eight Mm? Did you say you lived away from home for a bit? Yeah, when I were eighteen. Now erm you were saying bef was there a union at the at the time? Oh yeah. What you, what you There wasn't. You, you lost your job trying to start one. No th there was a union we were trying to enrol more members. Oh. Oh the union was there, the Amalgamated Society of Leather Workers. It was a national union, but it was a crime more or less with some bosses to belong to a trade union. Now it's a crime if you don't belong to a trade union. You see, I think, although I can't prove this, you see what happened, when I was in the, in the glazing shop we were, we were on short time. And instead of er having half day every day cos there were no prospects of, of much stuff coming through, they'd say well we'll all have two weeks off each. Two men will have two weeks off and it were twelve in the shop. So two would be off for a fortnight, and then two more and then two more. Now the fella that I worked with was the president of the union from the branch. And I was er doing my part I thought to change the world and get everybody into the union so we could get, get better conditions for, for everybody and all this, more money anyhow. Er and I used to go to night school to learn, er National Council of Labour Colleges, to learn economics. Er and eventually we changed the foreman,the union changed the foreman. And the foreman er we used to play about, lark about, throw orange peel at each other you know, cos it were a boring job you just stand like this and you could more or less close your eyes, you know. After a while so to, to relieve the boredom we used to throw orange peel at each other, little bits you know, screw it up and, and one hit this bloke who was made foreman before, before he was made foreman a and we had a fight. He come at me and he was six foot two and he come he were gonna knock hell out of me so I had to protect myself and we got fighting in the shop. Anyway we, we forgot about it and, and then he was made foreman later. So I thought well that's . Anyway when the time came to, to, to stop off for short time everybody had had their turn except the union president and myself and he came to me this foreman and he said er, now John I don't want you to think what happened between me and you will make any difference about being sent back for. I said, well I hope not anyway, I says er, if you do I shall have a go at you. So er time went on, I didn't get the sack, I just wasn't sent back for. Neither was the union man. Now how did you become involved with the union? Are you Well always interested in politics? No, no. I went in this shop with this, next to this fella. And when I hear that , when you're working you're talking as well and he, he, he was a good talker and, and he, you know, he was a good union, a good clever speaker and he impressed me. Er and then he got me he er he got me interested in politics and he got me going to this N C L C evening evening classes. And I got interested and you know it wer I was parti very very interested in, in economics. And did you become a union represent did you get involved in union politics? Oh yes I I was on the committee at . Er I was on the committee on the buses, but that was later. I was a rotor man for Bridge Depot. Er yes I was very keen, I'm very interested. Er What did your family and do your friends have views about politics? I means did they, were they surprised you become involved? Yes er I remember a chap at the depot doing the Spanish Civil War er wh th there was a movement going round collecting food for the, or money for food for the children of Spain. Children. And I was in the depot and I and I was er trying to er get some money for, for this thing or, or doing something for it anyway, and this bloke said, said John , he said, what the bloody hell are you got interested in the people of Spain for? We're talking about nineteen thirty six now thirty seven. I said, well, I said, If we don't those bombers in and, and Spain we're gonna get them over here. I didn't realize what I was saying but it proved to be true. Those bombers in, in bombing the people of Spain bombed us eventually. Anyway er that was the , er no nobody else made any comment, one or two was s s surprised. You know that I should be interested, well I was the secretary of Labour Party for a time. Whe when you started off becoming interested in politics when you were working at ,we were your friends surprised? Were they not interested in politics or, or your family? No, no, you see it's the fact that you're working, your conditions, your environment, if you're working in a certain place it's almost built up in the beginning. It wasn't till, till people got together into factories and, and er workshops and, and things like that. And working in close relation and discussing things that this is exactly what happened at . Now i i in one shop er you'll never hear mention of politics, it would be all football, football man, football this, football the other. But if you get involved working with somebody else who may be interested in politics then you start talking and this is how it develops. I mean er you see th I should say there was about six or seven who were keen on, on, on the trade union. They weren't reds, communists, or anything like that, they were just good trade union men. And they'd be talking, now you could bet they could get somebody interested in that shop on, on politics or trade unionism, they'd get one in that shop. Now erm was it through this union activity you became interested in the Labour Party? It's same thing, same man. I see, and did you, did you do a lot of canvassing for them and all this sort of thing? At election time oh yeah. Have you got any stories about that? Er well I were out of work and er municipal elections used to come in November. Er and er there were great rivalry between, between the Con er the Conservatives and the er Labour Party. And er apart from canvassing which we did. A canvass, cos I was a block steward, I used to collect the, the stubs and at election time we would do a canvass of our own block. Er asking people whether they were favourable, or mark them favourable or not favourable and so on. Er and then w we used to do the bill posting, vote for so and so, or vote for so and so. We used to stick ours up and if we see any fresh blue ones we should pull them down. Er and they used to do the same to ours. Er then election day we were out all day with, with a driver of a car getting people out and for them or going through the motions. I've looked after the kids for them while they've gone to vote, anything to get them here, that was the thing. Cos they, they er Walter used to say, any positive voters we must get them out on the day. And apart from that time during er elections etcetera how much involvement would you have just a normal we week, where there's no elections on or anything? Did you have meetings very often? Er well yes at er there were several er Michael Foot, Fenner Brockway, Stafford Cripps and Jimmy Maxton and Harley Pollet and Jimmy Gallagher. There was communists, there was I M Ps, there were Labour Party men, and at that time there was a unity campaign. Er it were led by Sir Stafford Cripps and er Michael Foot. Fenner Brockway, well I, I've gone to meetings in the Albert Hall, and I've gone to meetings at Sheffield. I, I joined the er demonstration in Hyde Park. Er when the Durham Jarrow marchers came Er we was there for the er when they came in. Er were several meetings, public meetings. Oswald Mosely, he was in the Albert Hall when, when all that trouble was, we were together then weren't we? At er Oswald Mosely you you used to go the weekly meetings the Labour Party. the month That's what that's what you're talking about isn't it, the weekly meetings? Monthly, monthly meetings. Pardon? Monthly meetings. Monthly meetings Yeah you used to go to Oh yeah it was a monthly meeting. Could you tell us about Oswald Mosely, and s and wh what happened then? Well er first of all you'd get the minutes of the last meeting and then you, you'd get correspondence and then you'd get chairman's remarks. And then somebody would bring something up. It may be the pro prospective candidate or panel name to go forward on a prospective candidate or something like that er and then there'd be er a talk by, by the chairman about the finances or what we ought to do er to organize er events to improve the finances. It was all about money or you know there wasn't a great deal of political activity or, or great deal of political work done in, in the Labour Party. It was all done er er the borough Labour Party. Now you got, you got, you got your war ward which was nothing because the wards was er the chairman and the secretary absolutely . You know, er er and they'd tell people and, and there was no, never much debating as such. What you laughing at? Nothing. go on. He er he asked you about er wh who was it? Mosely, did you say that you went to see Mosely in a meeting? We went to a public meeting at the Albert Hall, me and her, when Sir Oswald Mosely came to . Er and a lot got chucked out. When was this? Ooh nineteen thirty six or seven. And was he, go on. Before we was married. Thirty six or seven. Thirty six. And we, we was up in the, in the, it was a protest as far as I was concerned. Yeah. You know and we went and we booed and er a lot got thrown out, cos he had his mobsters there you know. And er he were a bit rough with them and all. Ah. Was there a lot of trouble then? Wasn't a great deal of trouble in but th there was in the East End of London if you, if you we can read, can read about that. Er and in several places where he did go because he, he, his supporters were thugs really. You know there were no doubt about that, they were And how much, how much were your subs for the Labour Party, how much was your membership? Ooh er wasn't er I can't remember now. I think it was er wasn't a great dea sixpence I think it was. And when did you join the Labour Party? Ooh I'd be ninetee er twent I'd be twenty so nineteen thirty three. And, and were there sort of like clubs and societies associated with the Labour Party that, that you got involv No, no, no, no. No, the Labour Party as far as I was concerned was just a meeting, a monthly meeting,in above the Co-op in Grove. Where the Co-op used to be, not the Co-op now. In that room up there, once a month, and at elections times and that was it, no more. I see. Now, now you were saying before your father er was unemployed quite a lot of the time during your childhood erm did he actually get any Unemployment Benefit while he was on the dole? Yes er, now what did get? There were U A B, Unemployment Assistant Board and there was a means test at the time as well. Er when I was s I used to get eight shilling at one time Unemployment Benefit. And you'd got to go and look for work. And you, you'd got to tell them that you'd been, where you'd got, where you'd been. You know. Er Did you know how much your dad got? No. No no no not can't remember now, not to be sure. Would the what exactly was the means test invo what did that involve? Did they come and visit your house? No you, you, you were called to, to the Labour Exchange. Er I think a court of referees I think they called it. Yeah. Wasn't it? Ah. Yeah. That that just come to me now. Court of referees. You didn't get money did you? You got food, food tickets. Ah ye yeah it, it depends how You didn't get money. how much er you'd got and how much you'd got coming in and how much you'd, you'd you know, your, what your erm commitments were and Right. you know. Er Did, did you at the time or in the thirties did you have any involvement with the Unemployment Claims Union or anything like that? I didn't. No No. not myself, no. Were other people involved in with it? Oh well there must have been. Must have been. Yeah, but er didn't you go to an Unemployment School? Eh? An Unemployment School. A club, an unemployment club. What, what was that? Well it was a place on Street, and it's still there, that one. It's above, above the shop, just above , up the stairs. And there was a big room and you and you could go there and, and make things out of wood. I've got a table somewhere I've made. Er or you could make anything and there was an instructor there showing you. You'd got the tools and different things and show you how to use them. You, you paid for it. Yeah, but didn't you have to go there to get your dole? Oh no, no, no that was that was a school. Ah that's the one I'm thinking about. Ah that's Street. Now when we was between sixteen and eighteen if you was unemployed you'd got to go to school. Half day every day. One week you'd go in the mornings, the next day you'd go in the afternoon. This was at Street Lad's Club, still there. Now but we had teachers, the headmaster of Street School, he was the head teacher at the out of work school. And then we had a, a two one teacher who, who later was at School. , Mr , er and he'd give us sums, arithmetic, tell us stories, er historical events or something like that. But what we were keen about was football. One teacher, he used to say, well what we gonna do today? Oh come on, let's go down Lane and have a game of football. you see. He used to play with us as well. We used to go, it's a nice day Mr , I go down, football. Come on then, and we, we'd walk down to Lane and play our game of football. But you'd got to go, and you'd got to mark your register and, and if you didn't go you'd lose a day's dole. At tha at this time in, in the twenties and early thirties was there a lot of people unemployed in, in Street and around there? Oh yeah, yeah. Oh yes. Er there were very very few that had a regular job, really. Er c c the density of, of the Street itself er cos you was nine terraces with twenty four houses in, in two hundred yards you've got a lot of people together haven't you? Er and, and the people that had a regular job, now there was one next door to us. He, he, he was er more or less well off, still in, in Terrace but you know he was, they seemed to be well off and probably were. Cos he had good regular job at . But er now in, in, in our yard, on our, our side, there'd, there would be er one, two three, four only four out of the twelve or thirteen houses the, the men had a regular job. And that was pretty, it was, it'd vary in, in some cases but in som it was worse than that and some were better than that, but generally speaking there were a lot of unemployment. Tell him about . What He'd come and borrow In, in, in, in one terrace and I'm not gonna mention names again because the, the family's still around, you know, and I don't want to embarrass them. But we'd to go down th one yard and, and in the middle of the yard there was a gap between the lavatories and, and the coal houses, just about er four foot s square. Well that's where we used to play cards, on top of the dustbin. A dustbin lid and put a board over it you know. And this man he was a regular dustbin, dustbin man and he'd been at it all his life and he used to play cards with us and his family, his sons, and, and as many else as got any money to play pontoon or brag. And because he wa he was really the only one that was in regular work in, in the yard, I'm sorry well there was another one but still, there wasn't many, everybody was short of something some day. And it would always come at weekends. And it would always come when we were playing cards. First one, Mrs so and so, me mam says, it was always me mam says, mam says can you lend her cup of sugar? Er mam said, can you tell her time please? Mam said, have you got a penny for the gas? Mam says, have you got a tub of vinegar? Or, or anything, you know so this er man one day he says, we were playing cards, he said, I'm bloody fed up with this. He said now what do they want? So me mam says so he went in the house and says his, his wife's name, he said, give me a pencil and paper. He got a sheet of paper about that long to all concerned we have no salt, pepper, mustard, vinegar, our clock does not keep good time, er Sugar. oh tea, sugar. He, he put all down and he, he pinned it on the back on the back door Did, did a lot of this helping of each other go on? Oh yes, yes. People er I mean th they couldn't help a lot because they'd got nothing themselves a lot of them but there was a lot of help done without any fuss or bother, I mean er er a bloke'd say er, have you got a fag? Er well I've only got Silk Cut. okay. Now to get in a pub, that was another thing. Of many, in summertime we always used to stand at the top of the yards, you know, men and women. Men used to be down on haunches you know and the and the women stand there arms folded gassing, gassing away. Er and then somebody'd come along and say, are you Jack? Can't. Why? I haven't got a lap latch lifter. Couldn't get in the pub because he hadn't got a latch lifter. Now a la latch lifter was thruppence, his first half pint. Now once he got in for his half, half pint in, in the in the passage he'd have, he'd have a good swig and, and it was about when he'd got to bottom of the glass put it down. I say what did you do that for? Well it holding it in pawn, waiting for somebody to ask him to have a drink, and invariably somebody would but if they did ask him they'd always ask him back next time you know if they couldn't do it this time. That, that was the, you know there was that sort of spirit, there were very few scroungers er well there were scroungers of course but few people who er who didn't repay if, if they had a drink they bought one back. They'd say, are you coming in? No I can't buy you one back. That don't matter now. And they wouldn't go in if they couldn't buy one back. There were a lot of that sort of thing. Oh yeah. Right Mr could you tell me when and where you were born? When and where? I was born on June the eighth nineteen thirteen in an place called in Carmarthenshire, South Wales. And how big was the family at the time? Well my my mother had five children with her previous husband and my father met my mother while this fella was ill and he eventually died with T B and my father married my mother and took on these five children like little pumps . They're different then to my Gail. And er, she said oh yeah, but the laces is too short, so I thought I get some other laces. Yeah, put a longer pair of laces in . Laces in, yeah Oh yeah. Say wear those, cos that's what she was gonna wear Christmas Day with her shell suit, I thought oh, ah, she ain't one for wearing trainers that, cos she won't wear trainers because her feet smell . . she won't she won't wear them. .

They did that with me with Hannah, right, they, when er, she had B P P done, what they call a B P P, when they do a prick of the baby Oh I don't know, she's had stuff taken from the placenta and all that's as well, yeah . That's it, that's what I had they told and they said that it might be that she's just, she's just is small for her size, but it might be that Katie taken all the goodness from Hannah Yeah. and erm, I mean they I mean they were born Good God, they reckon hers is gonna be three and a half to four pounds. . Yeah, yeah. . Five. . Yeah. Course she's worried, cos like she smokes a lot and she's say what thirty and that's her first, and they keep going on to her all the time like, I said well don't worry about it, you know. she does feel guilty perhaps she can just try and cut down a bit now. Well she has, she has, yeah, she's gone from twenty to five. Well And it is five, do you know what I mean it is like what I used to say to Rose . . ,. I mean Adam's lucky in that respect, I couldn't smoke when I was pregnant, I, it made me feel sick, I couldn't stand the smell of it, I had no urge to smoke at all, I went right off smoking, I respect, I was lucky, but I do feel sorry for these people that smoking at present cos it must be ever so hard. Yeah, I didn't smoke for the first six months and then I finished work and I was at home And you got bored. yeah, and I used to go round and see our Trace every day, and she was still smoking . and er, so I used to, I started again and then I didn't smoke until I come out of ho , when I come out, I didn't smoke Mm. for about a month, six weeks, cos I had so much on me mind . yeah, there's only three weeks between Nat and Neill Yeah, she's . yeah, yeah . Neill, he was seven pound odd so it makes you feel, sometime you think that makes you think well, it didn't affect, you know, No. but there again everybody's different aren't they? I think they have got a point, I think it might, it might , Yeah , yeah. have some effect on the baby. Well it's got to I think we've, look what it's doing to yourself Yeah, I think it must have some effect there And seeing you've got another life inside you , it must be doing something to them mustn't it? It's bound to harm, I mean I know what you said when he had all that problem, he sort of said reckon cos I smoke. You know I think you always bring the blame back don't you? Yeah. That's . Yeah. I mean if your child was born with one arm you'll still fucking blame yourself for it wouldn't you at the end of the day. Yeah , yeah It must be difficult, like I said I was lucky in the respect that I had, it never ever appealed to, to the minute I got pregnant, from the minute . Yeah. . I, I had to really stop meself. That really turned my stomach, even if, I mean I remember when I was carrying, when I was carrying the twins,and he used to go out huge things you know,and so much so that if he came home in the night, right, and I was already in bed asleep, I would be able to er, he would wake me in the bedroom cos I could smell smoke on him, but he didn't smoke, but where he'd been the pub or a night club, I smelt In the pub, yeah . He smokes now though didn't he? yeah,and I would make him there and then no matter what time of night or morning it was, strip off and go in the shower and , yeah, even in his hair, that's, that's how bad it was, I'd put his clothes downstairs in the washing basket not even in the bedroom one . I mean it was, it kept me awake it didn't matter how . You were together when you moved in though weren't you? cos I remember you moving in like thinking cor look at her with three kids , yeah.

And then you go and get your spellings. You can do them before you go up. Please. Tonight. pen? This ain't a pen it's a piece of plastic. Ooh. Now let me try and do it joined up writing like you do it. They's easy to do. Joined up writing. Monday . How do you join up a W then? I dunno. What comes next an E? Went E yeah. Oh I don't know You don't join up a W. You don't join up a W do you no. No. Pardon? How do you join up a W? Yeah well they were supposed to be in flat and then when they're cut it out you supposed, their supposed to turn it over Oh I see. Well. How do you join the W then Arf? Like went? You don't. Mummy you don't join the W . Yeah you do. You do it from the bottom. of the W Oh . E N T. I can't bear do joined up writing. I can. Went out to play with Kate . Is that your story? Wednesday we went to play with Kate. No, it says out with Kate. Out with Kate then. Out to play with Kate. Oh. Let me Hello my little darling and what do you want? He's been fed. Not having nothing else. No you're not. .I thought you'd written to Terry to sort those out. And they're both, about two to three thousand pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two to three thousand pounds worth of work. Well you can't afford to lose them, can you? No. So what's going to happen then? God knows. He said, I asked, asked, well I left a message on Saturday for him to sort them out didn't I? He already knew about that. And then I asked my father on Tuesday to remind him and he said, he'd already said he'd fetch them in on Tuesday. And he, my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would have them by tomorrow morning. But he's , he just really has to get in touch with one of them and tell them the prices. So I don't know. Well, I mean he'd done, he's done this first estimate, these are all just polishing touches cos people are obviously interested in, you know they're well keen on our prices. they can't pursue it till we come back to them. They're not pursuing it until we put these things out. My father just turned round I've had enough of it if Terry's not going to do the estimate he passes them on to Brian. I said yeah then I get into trouble with them for not passing estimates to Terry and then there's an argument. If he, if he says anything to me I'll just have to tell him. But he's not doing the estimates he's been given and he can't afford to throw money away. It's cos he's working for him at the moment money. He always gets like that and then he forgets after like a month or two when he hasn't worked for him. He forgets how annoying he can be and you know he swings the other way. I mean Brian's pulled in a lot of work. lot of people kind of saying come back again on Thursday So he's, he's . If we got Terry to do that we'd be well away. They, they would love him I mean one of them it was annoying really cos Terry's just not pulling his weight. I don't understand it, if I live to be a hundred I won't understand it. And also, it's cos that, you know after we had that row about Terry, after Bank Holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop, and er he's already owing Brian a day? Guess who's doing the extra day?got my dad to cover a day. And then he takes a day off Bank Holidays. and he can't do it because my dad . But then tomorrow he's actually doing his own work. So he could easily have . And on Monday So who's covering tomorrow? Well my brother's covered practically all week and Brian's doing tomorrow. Terry phoned up asking what, Tuesday morning about quarter past eight said who was covering. And he said well my father is doing today I can't do today I'll do it Friday and I shouted down the stairs but he owes you a day you shouldn't be going in. I mean he hasn't been in the shop once this week. Somebody's got to tell him to So do Dave and Terry in the shop . They have the records. And it hasn't been sorted yet? Oh no. He's got the gall to phone up on Tuesday and say Eileen can't do a day, we're going to be short of Eileen. So the answer is to just phone them. I can't do it. I'm not doing it. What's the point of carrying on like that? Well he's going to carry on like that isn't he? Not unless someone puts their foot down. And if your father is currently taking your side of things worth sounding him out as to how far he'll take Ah whilst he's in the mood? Yeah. He's not being that much You sure? Mmm. He's probably only in the mood cos he's probably upsetting them on his night out cos they go out in the evenings. On a Wednesday evening, don't they. Cos Terry I mean , wouldn't he rather have Terry as a sort of permanent worker anyway? It's not being fair do any work. Oh what, your dad? Pauline's dad er too expensive I think. Terry uses the shop to get extra money every so often, uses my dad ticking over running when he Why . He does get the offer, I mean two months and she phoned up and I kind of made out it got lost in the post. I erm got, check you've got two days, you've got give me the estimate, it's got to be on because she's expecting it to be done straight away on the computer and sent. And he actually got that one done. Do you know it was only five lines. I mean I could have made it up it was that easy. So I sent that off. She was in first thing, I mean I sent it off that evening she was in first thing the next morning yes that's fine . So he's got that job and another one . She's trying isn't she? I don't understand why it surprises you, that's what gets me. I mean It's normal behaviour . Charlotte's done it too. Can you pass me that er, sheet? This? Is that your reading? That's not your regulations you have to read is it? Oh no, that's a I was going to say that doesn't seem very thick No, that's to do with this tape. Oh I tell you what is quite funny these, the act. Mmm. Oh. hereby enacted her gracious majesty, you know, etcetera etcetera. What was it, the Lords temporal and spiritual, that's what they call themselves. Now that is, that's Yes. Yeah I realise and I hope I don't come into contact with too many acts of parliament. Oh, we had someone round to see the house yesterday. Oh yeah? They came twenty minutes early, there's Brian up in the shower, there's me stuffing things in the cupboard under the stairs. That's an old trick. I said to Danny, don't open the door. Don't open the door! So as I'm still trying to stuff things away, she opened the door and everything fell out. look round the front room, then they looked round the, the garden. While they were looking round the garden I you've got to get out the shower quick. I don't know. They'd come down from, they'd come down from,erm, somewhere or other. They're just doing a kind of tour of loads and loads of houses cos they keep moving with his job. Oh, right. She quite, I think she liked the area, she was saying about the schools and that. Mind you, she likes erm and they're all separate, all the best ones round here are . She said don't they have any details? So I said well, no it's not now is it, it's erm, oh it's that school that the . Something and School of Arts now it's called well technical School of Arts round here? No it's another, well technical, performing arts here. performing arts and that's the technical It's a monstrosity. Oh you rotten old pig, you've been sick. Oh she hasn't? Oh. Yeah, it's alright. is it washable? Yeah, I think so. You'll soon find out. Yes. Do you feel better now? Obviously. I think she thinks she's got some milk now. I thought you said, one, you had to have somebody involved who is?. No no no one person that's not right. Oh, right . There is no, statutory obligation for the person organizing it Oh, I know. Well not the organizer surely oh I know I would have thought you'd have to,shoot it I'm sure that the social services require psychiatric or Mm, I would of thought so obviously medical what you're doing. Mhm but they're to be qualified people involved. But I would have expected that the whole thing would have to be operated by, somebody who was qualified. I don't know, because like, you know like the doctors I think it sort of depends how big that you want to get involved in. If you're just somebody who's on the outside providing services, to keep the smooth running of it then you don't really have to know anything about it. Mm. But if you're actually involved in it, and you want to be involved in the people, then I think you have to know something about it. Well the other evening they were showing something on T V, one of these doctors', doctors' practices that are opting out or whatever. And they got a stockbroker, someone who used to be a stockbroker, actually managing the whole practice. Yeah. I mean he's obviously not qualified as a doctor. Mhm. So I mean I suppose they'll look at it in the same kind of way, somebody who's got managerial, management qualities rather than I suppose people who are interested in the other side of it, the medical side of it, probably, really be geared up to organizing the money side of it wouldn't they, usually one or the other. So have you done any more calculations on it? There's nothing really more I mean the whole thing is a budget guesstimate. I've no idea yet, really what, I mean, you know, for instance I don't know how much ratio staff to patients they need, therefore you can't really, you know, follow that up because you've no idea what the costs themselves could be. Well you don't know, have you, have you found the statutory requirement for space yet? Per person. I think the thing is going to come unstuck in the, I think the biggest thing is, I was thinking, is the fact that you've got to get I wouldn't get a commitment from Social Services until they see a property actually ready for occupation. Now I'm not gonna be prepared to go through the whole business and then find them say oh sorry you're wrong. Property is the biggest bugbear. Yeah. Because I don't think If you're actually sitting on I don't think the banks are gonna want to invest. To be perfectly frank. You see the only way we can get equity out and put money in ourselves is by selling this place. Yes. Therefore if we don't actually want to live in the same place as the residents, which I certainly wouldn't want to do, right. We'd have to buy two adjoining. Yeah. So that either means providing it, or something further down the scale . I mean that's, huge. That to be honest is, is somebody who's like, been doing this for ten years and has already got themselves like half a million pounds of worth of equity. You know it's a huge property. But you would need a large property to do what you want? I don't think so. It would be eleven bedrooms and five receptions . The point is, that you've got to count, if , you've got to count one bedroom Yes, I've got you count one bedroom for all the . You may even have to count two. You certainly got to count one. So two bedrooms out of twelve are no longer available. Sorry? Say that again in English. They're coming to collect the stuff next Thursday. But I don't have to do it every day all day. It's twenty tapes. So that's twenty times ninety minutes. talking about his estimates. Very exciting stuff and I've been telling her not to speak so loudly. Have you had enough now? and then I'm talking about right? It's gonna cost five and a half thousand mortgage. At this point would cost about just, just about half. Six bedrooms would pro , six bedrooms would probably cost you two to buy. five and six bedroom houses and you won't get anything under two hundred thousand pounds. How much do you wanna to bet on that? Mm? Where? I've been waiting for on one. Where? You've got to spend as much or twice as much there as you would there as you would anywhere else. Those other properties, there isn't half the amount of work need doing there as . needs a lot of work. If we moved in then we'd have to spend fifty thousand pound to get it up to scratch. That's just to live in. Alright, O K, let's say two hundred grand, O K? It's still fifty per cent less than one of those properties at Harrow Road, right? Fifty per cent less on the mortgage means erm about three and a half thousand . It's effectively eighteen thousand per annum saved, right? The cost of and gain four bedrooms the cheaper it should become. Oh yes it is, I don't doubt it but the problem is right? And you've got to be realistic. Because no bank is going to give you the money against the costs of the value of the property right? They're gonna give you the against equity equity of some sort. But the only way you can get the equity, right? The only way we could get the equity. We could do it. The only thing I could do I mean at the same time I'm saying O K I'll go in to do it this way, would be to actually say, sod this for a lark, instead of doing erm totally private thing, gonna set up a private limited company to issue cheques. I really couldn't I would never get the price I'd want for the alphabet. Shall we go for a stroll? No . Fetch the No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean, no? You've got to take the with you. Why? Why are you . Why are you going for a walk? To go and see What have you bought? Oh you're not starting again, are you? Yeah, you're not to smoke any more. I haven't got any. You are not to smoke You're looking so guilty. The pair of them. Really. Excuse me, excuse me ladies. Since when do you ask Brian if he wants to go for a walk? This is nothing to do Empty your pockets. Come on. This is going down on the table. Come on, you're not going to have them in there, are you? I'm not daft. Alright? I wasn't born yesterday. You might forget them one day and they'll get washed. That is not for me to contribute to. I haven't said anything about it. Amy . Let go of my neck. She's a major contributor to these tapes, aren't you? Shall we take her for a walk? You really must think we're daft. He's sleeping down here tonight. It's bad enough being woken up by the baby without going back to bed and then being woken up by . I've been going to bed at half past one and I was doing the T M A for two nights, then I've been doing his V A T for two nights so I've got to bed really really late and I just and, the thing is, the T M A were all on about my then I just start to relax I had to resort to herbal knockout drops. Oh that's very naughty. Right. Definitely smoking . Well, we were sitting there doing the V A T and I thought, I don't know that's just not but How much is it when you want to go cinema? Oh,about two seventy five I think but I'm not sure Is it as little as that? it might be more but . Well I'd either do it that way or pay, erm, credit cards. I don't really take any notice. Terrible Naughty, isn't it? I don't think it's terrible White Fang. Oh what on earth's that? It's the latest Disney extravaganza, and a wolf cub in it, oh Kirsty loves . Oh isn't it? No, it says here, the story of a young wolf. Oh, she'll probably like that tomorrow we'll go somewhere and spend my money. Yes I suppose by the time she's here look different. Gonna have your hair done?a perm. She hasn't got enough to have a perm, has she now? I think she's gonna grow it out. She's gonna, perm the top so she can grow it out. I told you, didn't I say, as soon as she gets it cut she'll be growing it out. Where are you going to get it done? Er in they normally cut it well. Bit expensive though. Twenty one pounds forty five. Just to have it cut and blow dried? Regardless of whether it's a restyle or trim. Bit expensive. That is. Mind you, my hair was a lot better when I was having it done . I must admit though it looked lovely, I'll say that. I only had a trim, but the blow dry made it sort of Do you remember when I got that, my hair cut really short? They did that, and that was, that was really nice. When I look back at the photographs I think And even when it was long I had, there was one hairdresser there called Paul, whom I'd go and see regularly . I'd go and see him regularly because he did it really well, once he left Well I had one like that, you know when we used to go to that gym up in Chelsea? Mind you my regular's back and she charges three pounds. six weeks. I haven't been since, what isn't it? Trouble is now, cos I know a hairdresser the shop, if I go somewhere else, it looks a bit you know and yet I'm not very satisfied with the way he cuts it, he's done it cheap. Mind you, he did Mandy's at Mandy's, I thought that was quite nice. Have you got a hiccup? Caught it off Amy. She's gone to sleep now? They are aren't they? But he phoned up to order it and said oh my wife likes these soppy things, he bought it, I didn't. It had nothing to do with me. Then he wants me to tape it so he can have it in the car cos it's on C D. Hold your breath. drink some water, concentrate Well, if you want to get rid of hiccups, drink Hold your breath and push seems to work on me. stand on your head. Run round the block or something. Why can I, er I can't have hiccup? Because you don't like them. You keep complaining every time you get hiccups, you say oh I don't like them. I'm trying to help get rid of them, sorry. Supposed to work isn't it? Once she's gone, once she's gone she's gone. Oh dear, oh we've come to the end. Oy, psst, you are a little fidget. Where is Adam and Brian? Mm? Where is Adam and Brian? They're not having a cigar, they're walking round the block. They're not having a cigar. So they keep telling me. They've gone out for a walk to have a cigar but as far we're concerned they're not having a cigar. They think we're stupid and we don't realize Well, I'm not supposed to tell you but he was smoking on the station when we just caught sight of him. Well I'm sure he was. I said how am I not supposed to say anything, I said I don't approve why should I keep this quiet? Cos it's not good for you. It's not on. Brian is, because we've been out a couple of times and he does, I mean if we go out he'll smoke then and then he just normally stops. Yes, he had one to celebrate, but he didn't just buy one he bought a box. So of course he had to keep smoking them until he'd finished Until they'd gone, yes. And he told me, well quite soon quite soon after she came along. I think he actually went for a walk with Brian. Oh, I assume he brought No, no, this was the last one. I said, you had the last one two days ago. So the last one of packet number I don't know what. Well Brian can stop terrible now, he's really snoring, god . I've got to the point now, I kick him and tell him to turn over, he turns it over and it's just as bad as before. Yeah, yeah. I don't want to be married. No, don't bother Well at least have separate rooms. I wouldn't mind, but it's normally me that goes and sleeps on the settee and I don't see why I should. Well, no the other day he said if I'm really that bad you just tell me and I'll go down and sleep on the sofa. And I went berserk about two nights later and said for god's sake you're driving me bonkers, go away and sleep on the sofa. He's turned over and started snoring. Well he can be lying there sometimes and I'll say, will you roll over please. Mm. Go on then. Mm. Will you please roll over! Or some of the time I've been sitting there in the bed feeding the baby, you know Mm. and go shut up! Shut up! It's awful. Well, I've found now I do a combination of what's that stuff, erm,orbathol that seems to help a bit. I don't think it helps him, it helps me calm down and go to sleep. Knock out drops. put that all over, I keep forgetting to take those herbal tablets, they seem to help with colds or whatever but I haven't got those upstairs at the moment which doesn't help. And then last night I just took my stuff and knocked myself out instead. I don't see why I should have to knock myself out have to be a man unfortunately. Trouble is I go into such a deep sleep I can't wake up in the morning if I do, you know, take the herbal stuff, I , I'm flat out in the morning, can't wake up. I think I got up about half past eight this morning. Goodness me. I had to go to work about nine. Oh what are you doing? Oh shut up. Go away. And he gets hiccups. He eats too much too quickly. He gets really violent hiccups though, you know, really th , they sound very, very painful. My baby's ones do. Mm. You know when it, you can just hear everything going ckkk ooh. Is she awake? No. I'll have to put you down some time. I felt so sorry for Christine. Do you know she's now, she was quite cuddly, she was fat in the pregnancy when I saw her last time. And in the space of three weeks I think the baby's used up all her fat because she's now just really, really pregnant. But, not so much her face, but all the top part of her looks slim, almost, you know I mean, she's got no fat left there, on her arms it's all gone. Just a bit left on her legs so the baby must have used up all if the baby carries on like this she'll be anaemic I think. When's she due? Did you say? Eleventh, so she's got another, almost two, well two weeks, ten days. Mm. She said she can't sit down, can't stand up. I was just sitting there for about five minutes then she got up, then she, ooh, sat down, then she got up. I don't think it can be too long. Now what about that then? I can't believe how quickly the time's gone. Mm. Do you want to sit down ? broke today. Ooh broke? I mean I was, one minute I was walking round, I hadn't touched anything another minute it was catching my finger. I looked down to see what was kind of stinging my finger and the ring had snapped and was pinching where it caught my finger. I can't get mine off. Well I can't wear a wedding ring now, it, just cos it's so wide, it's a really wide one. And if I wear where I had the eternity ring on and the engagement ring and the wedding ring it just felt like arthritis, it used to get really painful. So I said oh blow this that's coming off. I suppose I'll have to get another wedding ring. It's fashionable to have a kind of reason I don't think so. So I'm feeling less and less married the more rings I keep breaking. I can't get my wedding ring off. No. Well, my fingers get swelling as well, so I thought it wouldn't do any harm. Well I have finished Well they're all up there. O K. Well I could not ask you before. Well, yeah, if you look, ooh, I can't think where. I think there's a book-rack up there and I think some of them, the patterns are out of the magazine and they're just, in a rack, I think. If you go up there just leave them as they are don't leave them all over the place. put them back. Are you making something? Depends how much time I've got. Yeah. What are you going to make? Some Yeah? What the ski , lycra type one? Little? Lycra. Oh that one, no. fabric . Do you want the fitted or loose? You want like, like that, floaty? Like, like these, or, more like jogging pants? No, like these. Well if you want them to stay pretty as opposed to going baggy then you'll need to have a bit of lycra in the fabric. Keeps the shape better. Mandy loves her top. Oh, the body? The body? Yeah, she was wearing it flat out when she was So you didn't get a look in then? Oh no, I was wrestling it off to wash it in the end. She kind of wore it with everything she could think of I think that would go. Mind you, I don't think it's come out of the washing at the moment, I think it's getting water . I haven't seen it recently. Quite versatile really. Yeah, yes she wore it with a lot of you know trousers and skirts and The big thing at the moment is a new polo neck that we got from . It's actually ever such a good one. An X Together one, you know Together the label ? So Yeah. But you also buy it in, er, Alders, they've got them. . So it's normally quite expensive and it's, it's lovely material and it comes down to about here. We got it for four pound fifty. Ever so cheap. That's Oh, right, yes I've seen it, I've seen it. Well ever so often what they do they get the ex catalogue stuff. You know you can get some quite good buys like end of the season. Who are they? You get the end of season and it's if you look at the labels and go for the decent labels then you don't get sort of, quite reasonable quality. Mm. I got quite a few things in there. I'll probably have a stroll round there just to get a tracksuit for, when Michael was childrens' tracksuit. I used to, I bought loads and loads in there. Joelle? Could you just take the carrycot up and put it on the floor? Just so that it's upstairs, for me. On the floor?bedroom floor? Well I haven't cleared the cot out, so O K. it's funny cos I just I thought ooh, I'll buy it for her cos you know she doesn't four pound fifty I didn't mind. . But it actually really suits her, it's a kind of sl almost maroony red, burgundy type red, not quite and er it's a really good colour. Christine got a load of her pregnancy stuff there. Cos she said I'm not paying a fortune for stuff that I won't wear afterwards. So she bought Is there maternity clothes then? Well, if you look, yeah. Well she got a kind of raincoat, that, I don't think it's supposed to be maternity I think it's just supposed to be Oh yes, cos that was the fashion wasn't it? Yeah, yeah. So she's, she's got one there. I think she paid eight pound for it, and it, it looks raincoat . And it still fits, it still fits over the hump. But she's huge. I really got away with it, you know. I, didn't have a coat right the way through. Mm. when it rains, that's all. Really lucky. she hasn't got a car, or anything. She's Oh, dear. So she has to walk round well, Chris sold his car didn't he cos they want to save up and get a house. Even through the snow I survived. Very lucky. Cos I refused to go out and buy a coat. I used to wear one I had a jumper that my mum knitted that went wrong and ended up twice the size it should have been. But that came in useful. Yeah. Well, when Mandy was when I was pregnant with Mandy I used to wear this old, you know those rabbit skin coats coney coat what they're called? Fur coat thing. Mm. Well it was a kind of fur coat but it was rabbit I think, it was. I got one, ooh, well it was really fashionable then so it was quite beautiful sixteen years ago. I'd probably know what you mean if I saw it. It's just a little jacket kind of thing. So when I was pregnant that would be, that was fine cos it just Sat on top? Yeah, sat on top really. And er with Michael I'd gone out in Richard's and bought mys , ever such a full raincoat when it was in fashion. I still had it in the wardrobe so I just used to . But I still had more room than I needed in that so that was quite useful. Actually Christine normal size twelve dress that happened to be a full dress. Oh, a baggy one. And she's, she's quite it's a kind of cottony, stretchy, you know those ones that you have a V and then they're quite full, like this is full from there? Oh, I know, yeah. This is like a V. Well the V's just kind of gone up. It actually looked quite nice on her. She didn't look too bad considering. I hardly wore any dresses. Well she's got, she said she just wears the three, I don't think she likes like the trousers. Oh it's boring, isn't it, being pregnant? Because you don't want to go and buy as many clothes as you would have in your wardrobe normally. The killer is when you've got to go out to a special occasion isn't it? Yes. And you know you've got to Yeah. I bought this really expensive one, you know I was can't remember a wedding or something so I had to buy something. Finished your discussion? You enjoyed your non-smoking did you? Sorry? You enjoyed your non-smoking did you? Is it cold out? No mild. . It's a bit, nippy round the gills. Mm. Mm Well I'm going fishing on Saturday. Do you wanna dozen, a trout, if you, if I Oh yes please. have any success? Yes. Yes I enjoyed that trout last time. He doesn't even like it. He doesn't like trout? Well he does, but he won't eat it. Why won't you eat it? I suggest having trout for dinner, no. Don't fancy it. I like er we've actually had trout in the freezer for ages, and not used them fresh the day I got them I'll use it and I'm keen on trout if it's got a sauce. Mm. But to be honest I shouldn't be eating that sort of thing anyway, so I like it best with almonds, flaked almonds on the top. Mm. And that's not on my diet either. Actually onions and mushrooms in garlic butter How've you been doing? Oh alright, yeah. Last, I broke it last night didn't have enough time cos I was, if I'm doing his books all afternoon. Mm. And I didn't have time to cook so he went out, cos I broke it last night , well I was alright up to lunchtime. It's dinner time again. I shall start again tomorrow. Other than that I don't usually break it. How much have you lost? I haven't really lost, in weight I haven't lost any more but it's coming, my body's It's shaping you up? Yeah, yes. Cos, kind of, all my clothes You look a bit thinner in the face and neck. Yeah. I think it's maybe it's turned to muscle, I don't know. Redistributing Yeah, yeah. I don't know how to describe it. Cos I'm not actually losing weight, but my clothes all feel, you know I can get into clothes I haven't worn for ages. Mm. Well Suzy's going to Weightwatchers again. Is she? She doesn't look like she needs to really. She's put on a little bit of weight. She has put on a bit, but I tell you what Suzy, Suzy's problem is her rump and her her Yeah her legs. and her thighs. That's where she Because if you look at the top of her, you you wouldn't think No, you wouldn't think she was overweight. Take a picture of her head and shoulders. Mm. You'd think she was skinny. Mm. Well, she went right down to a size ten when she lost all that weight before. What is she now? Fourteen. Blimey. Mm. So she has got a problem then. It's all round the bottom. Mind you, cycling should help that. She's out cycling here and getting the train in the morning. Keeps her bike in the garage and pops on the train. So you don't need a lot of in the garage. No that's right. jacket. Mind you, isn't there some restrictions on what you can do with fridges? I think you can ask the council to take it away or something or take it to the dump you can take it down the tip, They recycle CFC's don't they? That's right, yeah. Really goes against the grain to see . Mm. Well we don't really need another one. We've got a fridge in the at work, there's one in the kitchen Can't you find Can't you find what? or something? Well it's difficult, isn't it really? Because it's, it's er under, under worktop Well, if, if they enquire they're only enquiring . That's true. Just ask for a fiver. Cos if you say nothing they probably think there's something wrong not working so they don't want to take it. have to get somebody to take it away. Well I think it's going to be a case of phone the council and ask them to Do they take them? I don't think I'll get it in the car anyway. Who's asleep proper now? now isn't she? Pardon? She gone? I'm not sure. Well how much does it cost to get in the cinema ? About four quid isn't it. Is it? I'll have to buy the tickets occasionally. I think it's about three, three seventy five. Something like that. Oh, cos Joelle was trying to, trying to work out if she can afford to have her hair done and go to the cinema. What does she wanna go and see? White Fang. White what? It's the latest Walt Disney. It's a story about a wolf. Oh that one. Fantasia. What'd you say? We want to go and see that Fantasia's coming out It's a last, last ditch attempt to get some money out of it, is it? And what was the other one? I was told, wasn't I? Fantasia and It wasn't one we wanted Hundred and One Dalmatians? No, no, we would have wanted that. Oh yeah that's it. Yes it was, yeah latest one, it made a massive, massive loss apparently. I shouldn't bother about it . It's so boring. I'd like Fantasia. I'd probably be sad and disappointed. My memory of it would probably be . Yeah, of course you saw it as a kid, didn't you? fifteen I think. Fifteen, sixteen. Oh no I saw it when I was about eight. And I saw it before that, about, yeah about eight as well. But I still enjoyed it the second time. Well I don't think actually, I mean I can remember and I don't quite understand what's going on here, keeps swapping and changing and I don't understand it. I remember I didn't like the orchestra bit. weird psychedelic bits. That's right, yeah. The Nutcracker Suite's my favourite. Hippos and things doing ballet dances. asleep. No, she's not asleep. I thought you said she was asleep. She was. She's just woken up. Well. What do you want to do? Shall I put you in your chair? Shall I? Oh you do make funny faces little girl. Do you remember provisional driving licence? Now how long has she left that sitting there? Ages isn't it I thought I'd tidy up in his desk and I was just going through the mound of papers, and I said here you are here's your licence, finish it off, fill it in, and I'll give you the cheque. Oh right, I'll and then she's moaning at him cos she wants to go and post it and you were mucking about with your C D thing or something and you were saying wait for me I'll do this then I'll miss the post. It's been sitting there for about three months. On the desk and she hasn't bothered probably with the cheque. How are you going to afford a driving licence? Totally ignored me. Oh, of course,expecting us to pay. Oh, that's a nice choccy. She sounded really cheesed off about I said how's your revision going, cos I knew she was doing revision, she went cccckkk I try a maths paper and I can't do that, and I a chemistry paper and I can't do that and I really . I said I think you need a break. I think you need to go and do something else for a little while I said cos if you keep looking over thinking you can't do it, have a break and go back to it afterwards you just get really despondent Yeah. and fed up and think you can't do it and you go blank and then you can't touch anything you and you know it's hard. Mm. Yeah. You know, you can see it ticking over . What am I doing. She was fine tonight, wasn't she? What was she doing? I dunno, I think she just, probably gone down and played some records or something . She's got to do some trigs and she just doesn't fancy trying, doesn't understand enough of it to do it. And the science paper she's only got the the kind of practice one, it's a very basic one. She's got no practice ones for the two, the other two she's got to do which are obviously going to be harder and she's got no idea, not, well she's got the guidelines but no real paper to sit and look at. Mm. This is for GCSEs isn't it? Yeah. Mm. Well you'd think they'd let her, you know have some old paper Does she have or not? Yes, she erm There aren't any old papers yet though are there? Well yeah this is done in Croydon last year and the year before so yeah there would be a couple Oh right. cos this was Croydon I'm pretty sure it yeah because otherwise she couldn't have the basic from last year would she? She's got last year's basic. Yes she's done er, both, three? four Well on Tuesday she goes in and goes, she's got till Tuesday, one's about six and one's five. Course Danielle's in the middle of it all now, isn't she? We probably know quite a lot of people who are taking exams of one sort or another at the moment. Gabby's going through A levels. Mm. She's decided she's gonna to become a milkwoman. Bit easier, is it? Yes. Doesn't want to be a doctor any more. She's wanted to be a doctor for six years now she's decided One of Mandy's friends wants to be a doctor. It's the one who's had cancer and she wants to kind of, go on and study and help the people with cancer. Cos she doesn't want to be like depressing, she said er no she doesn't feel like that because she's already gone through the worst so she won't, yeah she wants to help people who've got it. Which I thought was quite nice. Mm. Nice idea. Mind you, that's what motivated my brother in M S Mm. cos he had a, he had it, had it as a kiddy. Went through so many operations he felt he wanted to give something back to the Health Service. Well I think that's the kind of idea this girl's got. Cos, that's right we took, we took them all skating when Mandy was twelve . Yeah when she was twelve. And that's when, that week, well she already knew she had something wrong Mm. and about two weeks after that it was diagnosed that she had cancer of the ovary. Yeah. Cos she had all her bits removed, presumably did she? Yeah I presume so. She had quite a bit of work done. She had chemotherapy. She lost all her hair. Has it all come back? Oh yeah. She's all fine now. Is she fully full recovered? Yeah, I think so, yeah. From what I can gather. Very lucky. Mm. Yeah because it was pushing everything. You know it was taking up so much space. Wouldn't think there was the room in there for, for women. I was really worried at the time cos Mandy, Mandy was very worried, wasn't she? Mhm. It really seemed to hit her hard. Actually her friends have gone through a lot. I mean what with that girl and cancer, and then another good friend, her father died. Then, it's quite a lot to happen, isn't it? Really makes her think. Or worry. Mm. Whose father died then? Celestian's Oh Christ. He had, er, sickle cell, didn't he? Oh that funny version of sickle cell, wasn't very nice. Didn't know there was two versions of . How's that, er, Phil getting on with bringing up her, her baby? We haven't heard anything for I think she's alright yes. I don't think she does anything, well I don't really see her very much. Well her best friend's Well it must be, nearly two by now. Yeah, she's walking and, she's slow at walking though. Yeah, she looks alright. says she's not very well, she's got a thyroid infection, infection in her throat it's affecting her stomach. They took her down the hospital. And, they diagnosed that, and said try and keep, you know, give her fluids, but it's going straight through. And they've given her something low in glucose and that you know to kind of try and stabilize it a bit. Mhm. But she's not too good by the sounds of it. Mind you I saw her two day's ago and she looked absolutely fit as a fiddle so I said I think it strikes quickly and Mm. You know she looks a lot more comfortable in there than Charlotte did. Charlotte always looked sort of Scrunched up. She seems to like it It's the longest she's stayed in it. I wonder what's . Enough enough, do you want to go buy some Polo? Mm.

Let's hope she can't get the measles. Poor Aah. At least she's smiling. I'm afraid you know why. Windy smiling. Yes ah. You should There's a sad and there's a happy face, look Come on then have it up. isn't it? Put on a happy face . Oh it's awful when they don't when they won't do that isn't it? Some babies do and some babies don't you had a bad night as well? See you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Good luck. Bye. Bon chance. Thank you. One of us had a wonderful night, but somebody else decided to disrupt it. Oh dear. This one went asleep at eleven so I thought oh well I'm O K till fiveish, maybe Mm. but she was busy busy all evening What's that for? Mm. then somebody appeared in the bed at two o'clock this morning Nothing. and I really wasn't quite with it what was going on What are you standing on? before I knew it she was suffocating she was lying across my neck. Oh. But erm after I'd choked for half an hour she went to sleep I eventually went back to sleep again and Use that. she woke up at quarter to five. Oh what a shame. No no, no you can't And then she went back about half past five until nine o'clock. What this one? Yeah. Yeah. So it would have been a wonderful night. It would wouldn't it? Yeah What about that one did she go back to her own bed? Mm she no she Oh. woke up about quarter to seven, I think I was oblivious I just about sailed off again about after putting this back. Mm. erm Oh I wonder what got her up then? Goodness knows and she came toddling in with Postman Pat and Yeah. various other books the dogs Cos the trouble is it's a bit light then isn't it? What two o'clock? No. Oh it was two was it? Perhaps she's gone out She's gone out Okay sweetheart, come here love, let's get your jacket on. Alright, alright I'm coming I'm coming. You shouldn't drop your books on the floor darling, cos that's a special book. That's your muzzy book, you mustn't si look come on watch what you're doing right let's do it up, come here! Come on mum. Right, there's a good girl. Ooh you have got a big frame, haven't you? Goodness me! Alright? Yeah. Let me just check, Oh Jessie honestly why we stick to one place careful. Yes, there's one. Let's hope there's no right where she's going. Ooh there's a big girl aren't you? Ah? Yeah I'm a big bear. You're a big bear are you? Yeah. That's awkward isn't it? Wha well I can't do it. Getting underneath there. I think that's the only one, oh more here. Ready? Weeee there. Grandpa Come here,don mind where you're walking, sweetie-pops. Go on you show me. Climb up and show Grandpa Charlotte. Go on love Charlotte Charlotte come here love, please Grandpa's coming where was that I can't remember? Ornamental thistles? They're bloody vicious! They are vicious yes. Charlotte, come over here and show Grandpa. Right don't worry Dad I'll res I'll be spraying them. Look Grandpa, you've got to watch her. Grandpa. Alright Grandpa's looking. Whey! Look . look Grandpa a shade. Go and find this one now alright hon. Oh. Whey! One more. One more? You coming? Oh I'm not coming no. Grandpa can't go up there. You've go in little houses there are have you? Ooh look at that isn't that nice! Ooh. Dadda ! Hello come in, drill the cage, the cage turns and comes in. The mechanics of it would capture the young imagination. Yeah. Yeah. Especially if it's demonstrated by the younger people as well. I think that would be that would be terrific. As opposed to giving them possibly a ball bearing. Well Well I mean we well Well Well give them a ball bearing and a cage. That's the treasure isn't it, that's the treasure. Why I'm yes that that might be a bit more complicated because that means we've got to get a thousand a thousand reject up to a thousand reject ball bearings which are all the same. But we can get the balls and then drill the cases to them. No no are you I think this treasure is something they're gonna get, they're gonna they're gonna g come to the stand, they're gonna a ask a ask a question and and and be given once they've answered the question they're given a ball, any sort of ball from sort of Yeah. that big to that big which we Mm. we can pull out of the scrap. No problem there is there? No. No as far as as far as the ball and the roller is concerned,thos those are something we could give away from somebody else's stand. Yeah. Erm and and we could actually give if we if we can find some small reject ball bearings or roller bearings, then we can or reject I mean erm dead stock. Mhm. Then and we're always we're always finding dead stock it seems to me, er then we could give those away on yet another stand, give the cage away on the e on our own so we will actually have provided three, four different treasures, all of which are associated with bearings . Mm. Yes. Three components and one complete so Yeah. Mm. the thing might even begin to connect in the individuals mind er as to what's involved with the bearing. Quite true. Erm and and I mean the actual bearing when you you pick up a a a a little miniature bearing and and you can spin it on your finger and Yeah so it makes a lovely little toy. Apart from anything else. Yeah. If we could get some of them. Erm just round this table product. Er I should think we might just have some products on the table and some leaflets. Are you looking, who are you looking to man it, apprentices or or or young salespeople. I think I would try and get young salespeople to Yeah. er to do that. Mm. Erm We can get the apprentices operating the machine can't we. If we can get that machine though. Yes. Mhm. Erm and we have a er we could we could take erm a few people out of the er out of the sales office. Erm and maybe out of marketing as well. Lots of young people in marketing aren't there Jane? Well I don't know I don't know about that. Probably two, me and Karen. Oh yes. Right. Erm We've got we've got Leslie Leslie at erm precision . Yeah but the thing is Somebody like me, if I was stood at that table, I mean okay if you've got kids coming in, but if you get adults coming in, I wouldn't be able to answer questions, I don't know enough about the product. Erm. No I I I don't I don't think You've got to have I don't think we need worry about that too much. No. Er I mean if I if I try and cover it with one of our professional salesmen, Mm. erm I think that's going to be overkill. Mm. We're not going to get a lot of serious bearing enquiries. No. Erm and I think that part of the skill on the on on such a stand is erm to to show enough interest, to take the details down and say, The only thing that's important Mm. it'll be a matter of taking the details down and then if it's that important we'll have somebody call Monday morning. Mm. Mm. Erm to er Yeah. er to to to get back at it. Or alternatively, I mean if it's really that important, erm and and it's on the Friday, we we could actually send for somebody from here to come out. Mm. So I don't think Yeah I don't I don't think you will there. I don't think we will. No. I don't think we will. Erm it'll it'll be enquiries which are of very general interest, Mm erm which I should think you're just as much of an expert as anybody else at answering. Mm. Come to that. Er Most of the questions are going to be related to to what it is, are there any jobs available, or what type of thing. Yeah. General sort of Yeah. interest things. How Yeah. how can it help the er the Newark populace. Yeah. I'll do Friday and Gary can do the Saturday . Right okay. Done. Done done done. Well you don't ne you'll need some other other people erm Yeah. other people to help out No I was only joking. but er Oh. You you're not joking. I I've written I've writ I've wri it's minuted, it's minuted er er it recorded as well. So are we on tape here. Yeah yeah yeah. Er so so it's Jane on Friday er er and Karen on Saturday. No Gary I said. Oh Gary. That's why I said I was only joking. Right Gary on Saturday. Right, okay. Erm No we'll sort that out. But we need to no we need to sort that out. Er er I don't see that it's a big problem. And er we ought to make a very definite point of putting our heads together perhaps, what do you think, about early March or something like that. Er m no mid- March. Sometime mid-March in order to just make sure that we're all you know that that there isn't some great hang-up somewhere. And that then still gives us four or five weeks to put anything right. Mhm. Er how about somewhere around the twenty third of March? Right, twenty third of March, would that be a Yeah. a good day? Mhm. For the moment at least. Er and shall we say, what's a good time for you? What's the best time for you? P P M's better for me. P M. Right. One thirty? One thirty, fine. One thirty,Newark Show meeting. David,Eric,Jane, Me and anyone else. If you want to bring anybody else along. Yeah, Erm who's involved, that's fine. How's that grab you? Fine. Good. Yeah. That sounds exciting. Well it's a bit different isn't it. Yeah yeah. A bit different. I'm sorry to hear about your er apprentice bay. Well yes it's er it is rather a a sad story really. I think after all these these years of having a an apprentice bay running and then er see it more or less wind down. But at least it's w it's wound down without the apprentices winding down. Oh yes,we're er as you know, we gave four and a half thousand to the local college this year or last year Yeah. to in increase apprentices into er the engineering or bringing into young people into engineering. Yeah. Not necessarily for , but from the town Generally. The idea being is that they would now spend the first year at college, possibly we then would look at them better and Yeah. pick them off. Right. And we intend to do exactly the same this year. So so we've actually Chamber of commerce to certain people at college and we're hoping Good. it will embarrass one or two of the smaller firms to also put money into the kitty to keep our college orienta er orientated towards engineering. Excellent excellent Because er we can do the arts and crafts, there's no problem, but engineering there's in a sorry state. Yeah. that the engineering is now safe. Yes. Whereas up until a few months they were thinking of closing the engineering department Were they really? college. Yeah. So we've er we've come to the front and we've led from the front. We can honestly say Well this is what is faced with doing. It's what we're doing on a pricing on on a pricing thing as well. We've we're we're taking the lead. Telling everybody else what the what the rules are and you know, what the pace is. Erm and and er of course, did make a very clear statement that it would be the leader. Mhm. Well erm we certainly are in we certainly are in Newark. And I I think the the ongoing concern then is we seem to have got on an even keel with apprentices. Erm literally training throughout throughout the year. Staff of twenty one. Yeah. All of them have come out of the time over the nineteen ninety three have all been employed by the company. Ah that's terrific. Erm so yes I think we're we can we can say we've been leading from the front. Yeah good. And if we've now embarrassed one or two smaller firms into actually putting money into our college. Wonderful So er wonderful likewise we have some projects to show that we have worked very closely as an engineering firm, with the local college. Yeah. And the local people. As tomorrow we give Cancer Fund, three and a half thousand pounds, cheque tomorrow. Do you really? From the Gala Day receipts. Oh that's wonderful. So we yes we are It's erm beginning to very good. Yes very good in in that respect . Look look quite significant. Yeah. Yeah. No longer are we referred to as although we still we're referred as But it's getting it's getting the image it's getting Yeah. the image has certainly improved. Well certainly I mean this this whole initiative is something that I s just seemed to me when Philip got in touch in the first place, that that something that we ought to er be involved with. I think e the idea there of the cage drilling machine and the caravan is to show that our connections , with college, what we can produce with youngsters of today. Yeah. A and because schools outside the area will see what we've done, Yeah. It may give them the light as well as what Right, that's that's terrific Terrific. And we have been involved, I have certainly been into schools a fair bit but but they're erm they are a bit reticent they're certainly slow to come forward to ask for your for you help and and Right. Wh while while you're erm doing that while you're th while we're thinking about that, erm there's something else on the schools front and the promotional front which which I am in the process of setting up. Which er I will be officially erm circulating to the factories er later and that is a national erm Yes yeah. Of setting a real live project for a design and technology A level student. Mm. Now because of other connections I've done it through Eton. Er not doing the one this year because of the changes that Mm. are going on and I just didn't feel that we could erm support one. But with the arrival of Ruddington, er the erm we have a wonderful opportunity there for doing something pretty pretty flashy. And so I've tried to open it up er rather wider and w what I've I've I've been put in touch with a a thing called the independent schools, design and technology association, which covers design and technology studies in all independent schools. Erm and in due course, they are hoping, that body is hoping to extend not just to independent schools but to all schools and be a design and technology education association for all schools. Erm however they're not there yet. Now it concerns me that er I don't want to be associated with the possible charge of elitism if we're only associated with independent schools. Therefore what I want to do is to seek the support of the factories to er spread the word, to circulate the information necessary to all the schools in the area. So that any any school within Nottinghamshire if you like or or Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire or whatever might be appropriate in this area. However many you thought you could manage, it might just be the two Mm. secondary schools in Newark come that. Erm but that that opportunity would be there to circulate the information and the the entry rules er around the erm er er state schools within within the sort of factory catchment area. So it's an opportunity for the factories to promote their own activities within whatever they regard as the school catchment area. The way it's going to work is that we will er that the first thing is to invite applications. And the individual student will submit an application with some er example of work already done. And I don't know, I asked th the chap from the I S D T A how many people he thought we might get applying, he said he thought, well if we got fifty we'd be doing very well. Er so say we get fifty people applying, we will then use those application forms to decide how ma er sorry which ones we're going to go with. And I've said that the maximum that I think we could reasonably cope with would be five. And then we would give a complete project specification to the five participants and er we would invite them to visit a factory, to have a conversation with a sales person, to get a bit of a feeling for the style of thee of the be doing area. However many you Mm. out of those, and one will win and we'll have a second and third prize and the fourth and fifth will be runners up and erm highly commended or what have you. Er and basically what I want to do is to put the winner, the winning e exhibition into the new reception area, for the new erm office at Ruddington when it opens. Mm. So that er we can sort of give a great big bit of publicity for the schools, for the individual, for the concept of design and technology at A level. That sort of thing. The other four er erm loser er like as not, will be on display and remain on display in the er in in in the atrium area which is Mm. going to be a display area for product and projects. So erm we can give them a bit of a Mm. bit of a splash as well. So what what I'm that that that's the sort of basic outline and I see it as an opportunity of putting the name in front of quite a lot of schools Aha. erm and in the design and technology area. Er it is then an opportunity of getting at five five individuals and giving them a a pretty thorough going over and and a lot of encouragement. It gives them the opportunity of working on a real live project er which actually has an end point and is going to be used. It also gives them the incentive of winning some cash. Er it gives us when when we actually set the thing up and make the presentation, it gives us another opportunity for publicity not only in the local papers o of our own area but the local papers of wherever the school was. And it could be anywhere round the country. Erm and I would I would want to try and do some er organize some press coverage at that time for the losers as well as for the winner so that a a and one of the things when we select the participants, er the entrants, er we will not have them all coming from the same school or from the same area, even if the five best entrants all do come from the same school . Mm. We won't have that, we'll have them from Yeah. where suits us. Yeah. Er er er so so we've got lots of opportunity for er getting the name in front of young people, promoting design and technology and the engineering concept, getting these kids working on something that's real and live, erm and generally promoting the whole thing. Mm. So er in the course of the next week or two, I will erm be writing officially to er to each of the factories to invite participation. Right . Er and I daresay you'll get involved in that when the time comes . Mhm Yes. For Road and Yeah. and and Road. Yeah So er there we are. Oh yes.. Yeah. Of course there's I don't know whether you'd well you won't if you haven't been involved but we for the last last year and this year we've had this children from er there's a a sort of Nottingham University Yeah. is where it's set up from. Er and the young people who've left school er who are having a year out in industry before they go to university. Er and and I've found it very useful in t term I've just seen this. Would you like a cup of coffee? Yes yes. At the minute the erm last year's last year's individual with us he had I think he had he had five A levels of which four were grade A and one was greed B grade B. That's not bad. And and er he's gone off to Warwick University to do doing maths and stuff. And a chap, lad this year's got not quite the same but very very good A level results. Please. You must think I'm absolutely barking just to have been sat with this in front of me and not done anything about it. Thank you. No Philip must have been er wondering what on earth it was doing there . Er so erm Well it's it's on on the sane vein, just like the machine tool association competition was that the apprentices went in for. Yeah. Erm that was on the same vein and they got they got a ce er a certain amount of national er erm national er publicity. Yeah. Milk? No thank you. Jane's have some I think by the look of things. Thank you very much. Erm well I don't think one can do too much on that score really can one. Er any publicity is good publicity. Yeah. Yeah. Are you doing the open day again? Or has nothing been said about that yet? Or is it just assumed you would do an open day ? No I don't think we're doing an open day this year. We're still having another gala day. Another gala. And er I think throughout the year, er all of the younger apprentices, either sixteen, eighteen year olds have now been enrolled in Duke of Edinburgh Award Have they? Scheme yeah. And they're all about to do their silver. One of the somewhat older guy, he can orchestrate it so much so that he gets his gold out of it. Out in in he he's going straight to gold is he? No he's done bronze and silver. Oh he's done them yeah. And he if the rest of them get silver, he will get a gold. It's rather rather good actually. It's a form of team leadership Yes. And er we so we'll we'll pull that in over the year, over this next year and that's one of the projects that Good for him. I think younger guys, the sixteen, eighteen year old with their silver award Yeah. er and of course the gold award erm older guys next year's team then can go on for their their gold. Not that we're making any stipulation as part of their apprenticeship but er I think it's a good idea, they have extra Yeah. erm just beyond the engineering side. What it really means of course is that erm I've committed ourselves to doing the dare I say it, the odd jobs. It sounds v the odd jobs to do with all the the smaller schools and and Yeah. er kindergartens. As you know, we fixed the roundabout for the people in town, I can't remember the name of the place. I used to call it the back of actually. But nevertheless we Yeah. the the guys went up there and they fixed it and they were very very We had Christmas cards from them and we've Lovely. And so I what I said was, as part of their community service, we would then earmark the various small erm children's homes, old people's homes and they would go as a team of electricians, fitters, craftsmen and do a community work. Marvellous To towards their silver award . Towards the So we will be flying the flag there. Because of course they will be wearing our Very constructive. And that has a a nice ring to it. That younger element, are doing something for the local community. And we're trying That's very good. we're obviously there's old people's homes here on Drive, there are lots of small erm kindergartens that will require their appliances being serviced. Yeah. And things of this nature. One project was to literally find out all of the old age pensioners in town and go along as a group of electricians and check all of their appliances for them. Quite . Mm. So they'll have so many houses to work in,they will go along initially and make sure the plugs on er irons and It sounds very simple but it's part of helping the community. Yeah. Yeah. For their award. Erm we'll be flying the flag on on those I tell you yeah . Well that's very nice. That's very nice. Good initiative. Of course they they have to do all that out themselves. They've got to negotiate with the the er people that run these homes and and erm and that kind of thing. And set it up? And set it up. Yeah. Oh it's all part of their er their project. But likewise we were looking for another project similar to what er Eric and I were involved in with the cage drilling machine. I think superb projects. We're only hoping at the end of this year, hopefully the company will incest in it. And buy some. They have they not Cos I thought they were going to buy some of these drilling machines . Oh yes but but but what they're doing now is all the erm, they did the presentation to the manufacturing side, Yeah. er with your assistance. Yeah. Er they did they did the sales pitch to and then management came back and said, well we need automatic loading and modifications to it. Yeah. So they've been working on modifications and this year, oh we will we'll put the modifications right and then come back with another sales pitch to Right oh I see. Yeah. Yeah. They're doing another one but I think erm was talking to er Andy the other day because erm I've been in manufacturing management meetings at Yes. where they're talking about spending money on a one of these old old cage drillers, tooling it up to drill cages at . And and my ears went you know, what on earth are you spending all this money for on that Yeah. when when you've got this new technology which you can develop. Mhm. Er and it looks as though it certainly in in Andy's budget for this year Mhm. and a bit later on, he's looking to put erm I don't know, twenty thirty thousand into building a brand new cage drilling machine based on that technology. But using the the technicians and who who the main ones Robert and Bill Mhm. with Brian ,main input really. Mhm. That sounds excellent doesn't it. Yeah. Yeah. So they're looking because we we at precision now need it but we need it faster than if we if we awaited for this, then put in and so on. Yeah yeah. Erm you know, five years hence, we don't want it in five years hence, we want it the end of this year, early next year . This year. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. But so far you see, the er have been involved in it, who have been craftsmen, technicians have all come out of the end of a B Tec qualification with a distinction On the project. on the project. Yeah so yeah er yeah. it's It it it I I think there's a lot to be said for er people doing almost any sort of practical course like that, to give them something which is real. Because certainly the thing that particularly struck me about these design and technology A levels which so often seem to be sort of er erm a contrived project, not not a real one. And and the three individuals who I worked with particularly, they'd all been more or less written off, and they all come through with distinctions. Yeah. And and the feedba I mean I've had feedback particularly from the parents of of all three, and in every case, er they have said, this was the making of this guy. Mm. You know i it's pick picked him up from being very much an also ran for whom there was virtually no no hope, er to leaving the school with a a really good qualification and a sense of pride and purpose Mhm. erm er which has really made a big difference. It's a good thing really, my son did erm A level craft, design and technology Yeah. er and erm he he he designed his own thing what what Yeah. what he wanted to do and and then he got a reasonable pass and went off to university. But I think if er if he'd have had a firm's input, that wanted something designing, he'd he'd have done a lot better. Yeah. Because the thing he produced eventually, it fell over at the end of the day Yeah. you you know I mean, but he'd put the the research and the effort into it to get the pass. To get to get the Yeah. qualification. Yeah. But if he'd have had some a little bit of direction Mm. from a firm you know, I'm sure he would have he would have got a distinction er an A rather than a B you know. Well than the other the other thing which I think particularly in the last one that we did which was finished back in March, we kept on changing the specification, because it started off such a such and specification and it was going to the Hanover Fair in Germany Mm. in April. Or May. April. April. And then we decided not to go to the Hanover Fair, so change the specification so that it could be a a versatile sort of display for whatever we wanted to display. Er and then I heard from Australia that they were going into the engineering exhibition in Melbourne and I offered them er a mobile display and they came back with one or two added ideas and so I changed the specification again. That was going to be in May so we needed it to ship in April so I said, well you've got to you've got to still finish it at the same time. And then Australia came back and said, no that won't be soon enough, you've got to ship it I can't remember when it was, beginning of March. And so er the guy had to bring the whole project forward a month. Mm. Erm and er he worked like the blazes to get this thing done . Er and it was quite complex Mm. and it worked, and it got over to Australia, it got unpacked and it still worked when it got to Australia, and it went on the stand and it stood on the stand for a week or however long it was. Er and they've now got it stashed away in in Australia waiting for the next exhibition. Mm. Mhm. So it it was it really worked well. Very well. And I'd like to do something like that again. And I mean, some of the some of the results that we get from this competition, might well be appropriate for a a stand at an exhibition somewhere. Or it could be that they would be appropriate for the reception area in one of the factories, or we might give one to a distributor and say, here you are, this you know, put this in if you've got the right sort of area and would like to use it for a bit, stick it in there. You know so there's all sorts of What happened to that The first It's in mothballs down in the . Was it ever repaired? Oh aye, they repaired it Yeah. they were modifying the I think it was the geography of the world. I mean like Australia Oh a mere detail in the middle of the Arctic Put Australia in the Northern hemisphere and that sort of thing. But er Yeah. yes it er I think the the wiring needs to be changed because i Yeah. it had a wooden a wooden bearing would you believe Did they? Yeah. They modified that Yeah. I think that was okay. It required slip rings Yeah. Which was a very good thing most of the the young apprentices would never know about slip rings. Yeah. They had to manufacture that part itself. Yeah. And er as I say, at the moment Well when you when you say it's in mothballs, erm how seriously in mothballs? I mean if could you take the mothballs off and dust it off and it would work? Plug it in and it would work? More or less yes, just a few adjustments and it could be up and running I would think. Maybe maybe a couple of hours work on it to put it back together . Cos I mean, that again is something that that one might put into the into the tent or something. See the idea was it it picked up the the balls, took them to the and then the ball rolled round inside globe, slowly down to the bottom and then picked it up Yeah. Originally it was supposed to be water wasn't it in in in the bottom. Er there was going to be water in the bottom at one stage but that Yeah. got a bit too complicated. Yeah. He was o he was over ambitious. Mhm. In the design. The idea of the three spotlights of course Yeah. was was see that the ball Yeah. Yeah. rushing round inside of the literally going round the worlds and then down and then . Yes. Erm I know at one time they were the motors were going to fast, the ball was . But the idea of course was to bring the electrical, mechanical and the technicians to redesign the little bits that were Yeah. Yeah. erm the inside they they had to redesign that because the wood er had almost become charcoal were the Yeah. had been so that Had they really? Yeah. Erm and again to make it safe, it all ran on a twelve volt system. That's right, it was on a twelve twelve volt erm wiper motor. Mhm. And er and that that's They had to take the top off to make it safe, that's why I say a couple of hours work to put the top back on, erm makes balance. What it really required was probably sandbags or or steel in the base to keep the base Mm. Yes. stable because it was rather top heavy A bit top heavy. Yeah. with the globe at at at the top. Well er I mean a brilliant idea really. I mean if if er erm er if it would work, Mhm. I mean I one of the things that I've always sort of had in mind is that we put it down in the reception area. Mm. The only things is that now if we did that, what we want instead of saying on it, it ought to say . Well possibly I ought to put it on my review panel and er if there's a requirement for it. If you could dig it out if you could dig it out Mhm. we'd put it down in the reception area. Mhm. Yeah. For a bit. And then if it if if we have it down in reception for a bit, er and it works and doesn't look like falling to bits, the we could consider taking it along to the Newark Show as well. Mhm. As I say, it's that mechanical movement that catches the eye globe slowly turning round and the Yeah. Yeah. I think the stress and strain on the bearings for instance, the the middle bearing of it was underrated to carry that amount of weight, not in the vertical sense but in the yawing to and fro . Er old spin and and yaw. Yes it might have been. Yeah. It might have been. They need the extra weight at the bottom. The shaft needed to come through two bearings to give it that stability . Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But erm the idea is have this up and running and look at the problems. Right. So th this caravan aside Yeah. can presume that it it's going to involve as a whole so it will have some Yeah. industrial type applications and precision applications in there. Well I I guess the graphics need to be looked at in that Mhm. Jane. Whereabouts is it? In the grounds of the college. If you go by the side of the college you'll see it from the Where you pull into the car park? under the trees. On that side. Yeah it's a sort of er trailer thing you can see from the pavement. Mm. They had it on the gala day. Used it on gala day. I didn't go to the gala day. We towed it to er and back. That was a feat of I think the nearest thing to it is probably towing a caravan er a pyramid. Really? Yes. Mm. Quite a quite a lot of wind resistance . Aerodynamic Yeah. It wasn't the best But ideal it's it's very spacious inside. Yeah. Erm in that respect. And erm I mean we towed it over a thousand miles so the Yeah. the local journeys round the town, there's no problem. Mm. The average car could pull it. Mm. Erm it's very well made we have a video, watching it being made from the bare Well all the way up to it's That that's that's certainly something Do we have a video on a on a loop or anything . Erm cos that that would be the ideal thing to do wouldn't it . we haven't yet got copies, they're just masters at the moment but Ah but we'll have copies by May surely. If the European sales companies get their fingers out and get the languages checked for me then yes. I'm quite happy to have it in English. Erm yeah that's another thing. Yeah it c it can be put onto a loop. Video. So the as far as I'm concerned, the the two projects put together erm really do show what we can do we can do with a a team of bods. Originally the er the idea was to to build this caravan in connection with School. Yeah. And er we were told that, we were told that our apprentices would be working alongside apprentices from Mercedes and Volkswagen and and so on and so forth. That wasn't quite true. So consequently we made sure that we we picked the best of our guys to match Yeah. Yeah. the German Er secondly there there was a golden opportunity for our apprentices in industry to go and see German industry and French industry. Yeah. And so on and I'm pleased to say that they came back saying, Yeah we can still hold our head up high. The the fact that we are very good at what we do. Yeah. Of course we didn't realize that these would be erm students from from schools. Yeah. So their engineering knowledge was very little. Still basic. Very basic. Yeah. So consequently our guys ran circles round them Marvellous. and we balance it out that we had to built the caravan, the deadline we had to tow it across there in back end of March. Erm so it had to have all the lighting, official lighting for the continent and so on and so forth. Yeah. And that was a bit of a nice little deadline the pressure was on. Yeah yeah. But er we got it over there and I'm quite pleased to see it, the entire school, six hundred pupils turn out to see this thing being towed up there on a Wonderful sunny evening. Wonderful And er had a tremendous press coverage over there. Yeah. likewise the when it went through the town on the way out, everybody turned out to see this thing leaving . Because of the association between and York, being twins Yeah yeah yeah. And people were in the street shaking hands and Marvellous absolutely marvellous you know. Brilliant. Of course the logo was the biggest logo on there you see. Er and even lads from the college, it was a mixture of five welding students and and five students Yeah. er I think our guys stole the show Good. Right, well we're on to a we're on to a new er a new era, a different erm different angle. Er and erm there we are . bef between now and March. Or are you gonna Well erm no doubt Jane will actually look inside the the caravan. Mhm. Yeah. Sometime and see what the facilities we've got there. Erm I can certainly no problem. I've already earmarked the cage drilling machine just in case we did require it, to make sure that no parts were taken off it to support the next one . Right, good yeah. Erm this is where we've asked our tool room to supply them with any parts, save taking them off the the original. To make sure it does roll. And now if with your wish we can certainly go ahead and make sure it is in tip top condition. Yeah. Make sure was have enough material to make the these cages. Yeah. Erm so I I'll concentrate on those those Terrific. those two things. Yeah. And again the the manpower to run it. Yeah. I E if it works out in er that the younger guys to match up with the make sure they've got the experience to actually fault find on the machine if Right. But I'm pretty certain it'll run all weekend. It ran all week at the N E C. Yeah. Wonderful wonderful. gave erm Robert and Bill and Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. The idea is, if one of those and a couple of the younger guys, like we did at N E C Yeah. ideal. Mm. Yeah. Get the expert as well as a couple of supportive Lovely. Yeah. to talk about it. That's how we covered it at the N E C. Right. Okay well I'll I'll do a I'll do a note on on the various headings that I've made so we've all got the same piece of paper. Mhm. Erm and then we meet again in March. Er I'll let you know if there's anything cropping up again before then. Er but hopefully by March we will be able to say, well it's all ready to Yeah. hot to trot. Okay. Ready to go. Right. Wonderful, thank you very much indeed. I'll really turn it of this time. Your Royal Highness, Ladies and Gentlemen my name's Rod I normally masquerade as the Chief Racing Coach for the Royal Yachting Association but I'm not here in that capacity this afternoon but the coordinator rather a grand title for the Year of Youth Sailing and I've been asked to give you a short ten minutes or so briefing on where we're up to with th this project this year erm I know there are many familiar faces around so I apologize to those of you that may know some of this information already. We're already eleven weeks into the year and er so my talk's gonna centre on what we've done so far and what we expect to happen. The idea came in nineteen ninety two, the early part of nineteen ninety two er from Doctor Frank er who was er sitting on the Race Training Committee who approached it from the point of view we need to obviously broaden the triangle on the competitive side. And very quickly talking about it amongst the staff and er the other committees it would seem that it ought to have a far broader remit than just on the racing side so the first thing that I'd like to emphasise is that this year of youth sailing is involves all the outgoing grass roots divisions of the R Y A, that is windsurfing, racing, training and the development divisions and the regions and the clubs and the recognized teaching establishments, so it really is an all encompassing er er scheme. All types of sailing boats as well, I know that it's easy to think of that we're only dealing in optimists and toppers er but all types of sailing boats and all abilities, both disabled, youngsters and all types of organizations. The aims which I put up there, I won't go through each one, I think are hopefully fairly self explanatory, the, some of those are going well and some of them still need a hard push, a hard push from us and a hard push from the clubs and the teaching establishments. Those of you that have children or er are involved in education in any way at the moment will be well aware of the cut and problems that are going on er within reorganization within education in this country at the moment and I learnt to sail through the National School Sailing Association a long time ago er and thousands and thousands of youngsters have done that over the years. That Association in common with outdoor education centres are under severe pressure. My view is and it's a widely held view within the association and, and the informed clubs is that if we let that situation go on and do nothing about it we will have a decreasing er number of people going and number of people going sailing. Not now, not next year but in the next twenty years so there are a problem with schools, there are problems, I think, with changing leisure habits er people, the way that people take their leisure has changed over the last twenty years and not always have clubs, organizations and sailing schools taken account of that in, in their programme, especially with youngsters and I have to say I also believe there is apathy in some clubs and other organizations, not every club has an active youth sailing scheme and I believe that any club that doesn't either must be extremely popular because of its er prices of beer or, or some other reason or it may not exist perhaps in twenty years' time, so I think it's an ext extremely important topic brought about by the maybe, without being melodramatic, some of the stuff that we're reading in the papers about youngsters these days but looking at it from a purely selfish sailing point of view if we're to get more youngsters into the sport even if we're to hold our ground we've got to make a big effort over, over this year and, and it's important make sure that it runs on for future years. Okay how we're going, how have we attempted to deliver the goods to the population at large? As you can see, so far six hundred organizations have registered with us and what we've done is put them in a rather, rather flash booklet and the idea is that youngsters, their parents, teachers, youth leaders, scout leaders, anybody, gets hold of one of these booklets and in it, it tells them how to go sailing. There is one basic thing that they need to do, they or their parents, that is pick up the telephone and ring a contact, that's all they have to do because within here there are people ready to receive those er t telephone enquiries and get the youngsters on the water. Many of them free but not all. There are, different clubs have different policies and we haven't laid down what way they should go. We've, we've got the erm, we've got the six hundred organizations running so far about three thousand events, probably a few more if you count every single er course that some of the training schools are running but in terms of key events I'm very confident in being able to say there are three thousand events running around the country about half of which are new and that's the important thing so about fifteen hundred new and inaugural events that didn't go on last year or the year before Belinda the R Y A Public Relations Officer has been coordinating the public relations campaign and these days to get the young pe young people and those young people whose parents don't sail because it's to get at the people whose parents do sail, you've actually got to get in the media and er we've been on Blue Peter, we've been on Going Live another children's programme on a Saturday morning and and we have done other things that you see up there already and we aim to do more and get into specialist magazines like the Young Telegraph. The probe problem is having had a big initial launch the reality is that we're now going to drip feed the P R throughout the year and there are several good stories coming up which I'm not gonna tell you er that we hope the, the national and local press will pick up on. It's obviously very important that some stories are big enough to break if you're lucky in the national media but more important each of the clubs and sailing schools can get it in their local events because they're only too happy to take er provide the stories . Ha the information that we've put out so far were our second reprint of the er of the black booklet of which there'll be twelve thousand, they are quite an expensive item and, but our feeling was that er in order to sell the thing you've got to do it properly and er spending money doesn't come easily but er er in order to market the thing er thought that was the, the way to go and we've done other things, stickers and badges and posters and so on and so forth, the normal sort of things but we've really tried to spread these around the country and get the message that it's a vibrant young er interesting fun thing to be involved in for young people. We tested this out by taking it around the office and the people in the office thought it was a bit boring we er thought it was great for the youngsters who probably like it so er erm and the merchandise we've actually, we've made up certain things, T-shirts and, and, and wacky items that again er relate to, to young people so that they get into the, the, the theme of the thing and the, the whole year carries forward on a, on a certain colour theme and, and, and so on, so er we've done our best as sailing coaches not only learning to be marketeers again the money, where's the money come from? Well we were lucky in that we've been able to do, have a, a very good relationship with a company called well known in the marine side and they put in forty five thousand pounds into er the scheme and promised that before Christmas and that was reading the paper one day in November the, the Robert the National Heritage Minister saying that they may be, may, if you're lucky, going to put some money into sport and er so we contacted them and we were one of the first sports to get, had money doubled as they say in the bingo hall, so we er we now have ninety, ninety thousand pounds and which I wh has been distributed or will be distributed in the, in the following way so that's how we're gonna spend it and er these er, the administration represent we were basically overwhelmed with enquiries and s we took on a person in order to, to do it, the normal R Y A staff had already got enough on so we took on a girl called Sara who answers all the queries on the Year of Youth Hotline and erm we are also running the boat shows, the four or five N B L challenge which is the flagship event for our sponsors which is er I won't go into the, the details but is a, a talent fight, talent spotting event for under sixteen year olds around the country and it provided fleet of dinghies, the prize for which is a dinghy which is not, not a bad prize I think you'll agree. Information and promotion I have spoken to you about and the most important thing probably for the users besides us being able to promote what they're doing for nothing and that is grants, so we are about to write and er you will be able to hotfoot it back to your clubs if they are already registered. We are about to write to every club that's registered with us, tough on those that haven't, er that to er to, to, to come and er er fill in a form and get grant aid. We're talking about hundreds, not thousands here because there are six hundred clubs, so we're talking, but I think though we, we hope to be able to give significant amounts of money to pay for perhaps safety boats, perhaps instructors, perhaps rescue boat fuel, enough to kick-start these courses off which is important and those forms are going out at the end of the week and when the money's gone we'll stop giving the grants out. Okay. So what's the message we're trying to get across, what's the message you're trying to get across? Cos that's the important thing I think. So often we at the National Authority seen to be selling something which may or may not be you and the clubs er and the Class Associations round the country thinks important. I hope you think that this is important more important to you as it were than it is, is to us because you the clubs and the sailing schools really really must take these sorts of messages on board, not perhaps all of that list there but I would pick out erm that the message that we want to get across to young people, I would pick out the words fun, the words challenging, the words safe, alright. Many people who have not been sailing before, many parents are worried about their youngsters, think that it's dangerous and whatever and we have all this information, we have all these checks, we have a wonderful education scheme er within our own organization in this country and we should go out and sell that and I think we, a lot of it's going on already and I don't decry that and we need to just market that a little better to get more youngsters on the water because once we get more youngsters on the water the pyramid gets wider, the building gets higher, so that's an important issue well okay well just to wind up, I mean I've been involved in this and people within the R Y A and the office for a good six months now and we fell well down the line, the reality is hardly any courses have started yet and there's hardly any youngsters been on the water. I thought driving up today would have been a good day but the reality is that it is not going to start until Easter time. We've done a profile of the courses and guess what they all happen in the school holidays, so this isn't, this isn't over yet in fact for all the user groups, for you, the clubs and the organizations, it really does need a push from you, you must by and large are the deci decision makers, the club officers and I would ask you urgently whether or whether or not your clubs already got its name on the list, to actually support the people within your club that are laying these things on. If there isn't anything being laid on, chase it and perhaps get something laid on this summer in the holidays and whatever. Erm I think it's, I hope you'll agree, that it's absolutely essential and, and I hope that you, your reward will be the smiling faces of the youngsters when they come off the water during the year. Thank you very much. Commodores, Ladies and Gentlemen before we commence the business of the Annual General Meeting I'd like to remind members of the very great honour that was bestowed upon the Association at the end of last year when we were granted the right to wear the red ensign defi defaced with the crown. This is a quite unique privilege as the list of clubs and organizations granted the right to wear special ensign was closed several years ago. The Secretary of State for Defence reopened a list as an exception to allow the Association to mark the fortieth anniversary of the accession of Her Majesty the Queen, our patron, to the throne. The ensign is flown at R Y A House and can be worn by vessels directly employed on R Y A business. I would now ask Her Royal Highness as our President to mark this very special award by unveiling our ensign to you the members of the R Y A at this A G M. Your Royal Highness Thank you Ma'am. Well good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen I am delighted to welcome you to the R Y A's Annual General Meeting if I may call the meeting to order and may I propose that for those who's convening the meeting printed on the front page of the annual report and accounts ninety, ninety one ninety two to be taken as read. Thank you. During the course of er this meeting you will hear from the Chairman and the Honorary Treasurer and we may well cover an enormous amount of the grounds that is relevant to you as commodores, members and officers of the Association and it might be worth, I am going to avoid what he's trying to avoid most of that area because I believe they cover it in greater detail and give you more of an opportunity to find out precisely what's been going on. This of course is post-Olympic year. Now there are occasionally criticisms from members that there is too much concentration on the elite end of sport in the Sports Federation in this instance the R Y A but what is important about the is an effort to produce a very high standard as a finished product so to speak to go to the Olympics but it also helps to concentrate minds on the bit that is missing before and help to recycle everybody's concentration into the training area and Rod has just been talking about the year of youth and of course it follows on very naturally in a post- olympic year to launch that year of youth. Not all of those people by a long way have any olympic ambitions but is nonetheless an important part of the perspective and indeed at the triangle that we need to support. That's the overall and rather special context of this year in, in the year of the youth but every year is an important from the point of view of commodores and clubs and the amount of work that ac goes on on the ground through supporting causes and the effort to recruit membership and it's in that rather mundane day to day part of R Y A membership that I would like to congratulate you first I think all of you have worked extremely hard and the reports reflect the success achieved and I would particularly highlight the increase in membership, now that obviously hasn't been easy and this does require a huge effort of, a consistent effort and it's not something you can just apply every now and again. Members don't tend to respond very well from that basis. This is a continuity and causing support for your members and that increase reflects enormous credit. I'll come back to that in a moment because we still only enrol a rather tiny proportion of those active in our sport but to go back to the point about training. Can I also highlight the fact that over a hundred thousand people attended R Y A training courses of one sort or another last year. Now it is something that you could find out for yourself but on the other hand it is there and I would like to highlight it and bring it to your attention. The other thing that tends to happen in post-olympic years is people look at rule books and different types of competition and there is a sort of atmosphere of I think we ought to change things. Well change is fine as long as it's done sympathetically and actually has some purpose. Erm it's a difficult balance, change is very rarely popular and quite often it's only ever talked about but sometimes it happens and even then it's not popular but a balanced and open mind is required to approach change but perhaps more important, and this isn't always mentioned, suggestions about change tend to come from rather specific areas and there are rather specific interest groups which may start the process of change the point about membership is that you ought to be able to comment on those suggestions of change and get involved with them on a broad basis. Er those sort of reactions, if we don't get them changes might happen anyway and you won't like them. It is very necessary to exercise membership, particularly in, in those areas, change can just as easily be motivated from your members not just special interest groups and it is important to look at it in, in the broader sense. Your officers has members from all over the country will try to apply a broad view but there are changes that will be Right. So it's that one. Right! So, so it must be it is erm can I write it down on here? I'll tell you what write it down on paper and then you can copy it into your book when you know you've got it right. How about that? Hang on a sec ! Five point three nine. Right! I'll settle for that. Is that right, the way I've done it? By the way, I I did that so I did area of square along the side. Well I mean you've got the right answer so erm Shall I just write shall I copy it in? Yes, what have you done? Erm five equals twenty five mm? Five doesn't equal twenty five. Five fives are twenty five! You haven't got five times, you've got five equals twenty five. Five square equals twenty five! That's what I've been doing I meant I mean that! Yahhh But if you write that look! Five equals twenty five is not true! Five squared equals twenty five yes! Okay then. Right? Yeah. Be very precise. But you shouldn't ever write five equals twenty five cos it doesn't! Okay then. You mean five squared, you mean five times five equals twenty five you're looking for five squared, so that's the right thing to write! Alright? Okay. That is the hypotenuse isn't it? That there? Yes. Mhm. C Do you do ninety nine take twenty five? Which one are we doing? B. Erm I'm gonna do What have you got? Er You've got you've got nine nines are eighty one, nine squared equals eighty, nine squared equals Ah so what? Eighty one equals nine ! Ah pa cha cha cha cha cha Right. Five squared equals twenty five right now what have you got to do? Nine into ninety erm eight in eighty one take twenty five. That's right. So erm that'll be se fifty five fifty, fifty six. Right. So then you square root it? That's right. Seven point four eight. Right. Is it a hundred take nine? That's right. Is the last one eight nine four? Eight hundred and ninety four? Mm. What's the square root of eighty? Eight point nine four two. That's better! Yeah. Right, eight point nine four. What did you get the other one? Nine point eight O. Right. That's right. Alright but just wondering why you've got this book. She gave it to us. All of you? Yeah. It's like, we do a bit of it each night and it's over two weeks. The last bit we did was only the small numbers. That or wi with that. Oh. An an we're just working through it as a class and that. Are you? Yeah. And we didn't we didn't do our booklets this week. Well this, you see this is the interesting thing because that hum What's that in? I've, I've just been dealing with that in a booklet. Mm. If I could erm only remember which booklet it was. Erm That pa that page or was it? No, perhaps it wasn't a booklet. Perhaps it wasn't a booklet. I'm just wondering why, cos someone's been dealing with that Yeah. just this week. No! I can't, I'll have to find it some other time but er right yellow book two, let's have a look yellow book two. No! I'll leave it. Right! Er, so now what erm Do you wanna do some erm Have you done that booklet? booklet? This bo , I haven't finished it. Erm you, have you done any on it? Yes. Right, let's mark what you've done. That goes with that. You do this in your school book do you? Yeah. Right, that's right. That's right. Shall I tick it? Can do if you want. That's right. Is this all right? Well er yes, A five is on the answer is on the erm back cover of your book. Is A four alright? A four's alright, yeah. Now loo , look on the, no no, wait a moment! Look on the back cover of your booklet inside the back cover. Right, that's alright. They're alright. That's right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Are they all right? Mhm. Right. Shall we co continue with that or do you want You can do if you want. Is that but you're doing that at school are you as well? Yeah. Right okay. So B six. Er,one to mark here. Yep. This one. Well, I think perhaps what we'll do cos you've missed quite a few of these out so I think what we'll do erm is to leave that what you're doing there for a moment we'll go through this mark this and the one's you haven't done we'll do so that you've got this one straight. Okay? Okay. There's only one I didn't do. That one. Oh yes! So there is. Well, well anyway we'll do do that and see see what the other's like. You've been caught! Right! This one posts are erected at a hundred metre intervals on a motorway, how many posts are there in a distance of four thousand seven hundred kilometres? Twenty seven. No. As I say, you have been caught in a little trap! Posts are erected Forty sev six posts. posts are erected every hundred metres, right? Mm. There's a hundred metres there's two hundred metres there's three hundred metres how many posts in three hundred metres? Four. Sorry! Mm. Yeah. Right. Because at no metres there's one post and at the end of a hundred metres you've got two posts so you got one post more So it must be forty six. distance. That's what I say, forty eight. Forty eight right! Got it? Always Okay. be wary of that. And the same thing applies posts are a hundred metres apart. Mm. If you are at the fifth post how far have you gone from the start? Six hundred metres. How far have you gone from the start? Four hundred. Right! Fifth post, one, two, three, four, five the fifth post you have gone four hundred metres. Oh. So wherever you get that sort of question just stop and think Okay. because it's either one more or it's one less. The only time that that doesn't apply is if you are thinking in terms of posts in a fence around a square field or round a circular field. Okay. Because now after one hundred metres you've got two posts after two hundred metres you've got three posts, after three hundred metres you got four posts, after four hundred metres you've got five posts but after you've five hundred metres you've only got five posts cos that one doubles up. Yeah. So you got one, two, three, four, five spaces and you got one, two, three, four, five, posts Mhm. but on a straight line your Yeah. spaces are one less than the number of posts. Alright? Okay. So just remember that. That's why I said you have been caught! That's a ste , one of those little trap questions. Yeah. Now this one, four hedges together have a mass of two hundred grams how many have a mass of two and ha ? Which page? Eighty two. Found that quickly didn't you? Er percentages is it? Yeah. Right. E one. Have you looked at this? Let's have a look at it. B's height is sixty percent of A side. There's B and it's sixty percent of A C's height is a hundred and twenty percent of A's height. There's a hundred percent so a hundred and twenty it means it's more than A's height. If C's height was a hundred percent of A's height it means it was exactly the same. If it's less than a hundred it's smaller if it's more than a hundred it's greater. Now the decimal equivalent of hundred and twenty is one point two and there you've got nought and nought a hundred and one so ninety percent is point nine, eighty percent is point eight and a hundred and ten percent is one point one, and a hundred and twenty percent is one point two. So what you're doing, in fact is to if you've got a hundred and twenty percent if you divide that by of a hundred in other words, you move your decimal point two places that's a decimal. So a hundred and twenty percent as a decimal fraction is one point two. All you do is to move that decimal point two places. Alright? So to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of amount to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of an amount you multiply by one point two. If you wanted to calculate eighty percent of an amount you would multiply by point eight. A hundred and twenty percent you are multiplying by the decimal equivalent which is one point two. So write down decimal equivalent of a hundred and forty percent. That's right. Now calculate a hundred and forty percent of seven point five kilogrammes. Have you got a, you've got a calculator haven't you? Haven't got it with you? No. But you've got your own? Scientific one? No? No. You could do with one. Alright? It's one of those things that you could do with really. If you've got a birthday or something coming up and if somebody wants to know what to buy you that's what you want! You want one of these scientific ones. So, you want a hundred and forty percent of seven point five. Let's have a look. What is it? A hundred and forty percent, so it's one point four times seven point five. Try it. Use that one. Yes you use your finger . One point four times Oh it's . Ten point five, that's right. Okay. Ten point five killogrammes. Right! Put it on the, on the er on that desk which probably will be better. So, alright calculate a hundred and thirty percent of sixty seven pounds. That's right,a , what is that? Eighty seven point nine. Yeah, so it's eighty seven pounds ten isn't it? That's right. Right, B a hundred and twenty percent off thirty two metres? Oops! No . Start again. Right, one point two metres times thirty two. Yeah? What is it? Thirty eight point four. That's right! Now, a hundred and eighty percent of seventy four metres? One three three eight two. That's right. Right! E three A. What are the decimal equivalents of a hundred and sixty percent? That's right. A hundred and sixty three percent? Six six four. Yeah, point six three. Good! You move that decimal point you see, in two places and it's one point three. A hundred and six percent? One point nought six. That's right! One point nought six. Again,yo you, the figure staying the same, all you do is to move a decimal point two places. So D is One point three nine . One point three nine. Alright. And E? One point nine . One point nine or one point nine, yes. Right! A factory plans to increase it's output by fifty percent next year. So if this stands for this year's output at a hundred percent fifty percent of it has to be added on to give next year's . So there's your hundred percent and you add fifty percent. So next year's output is to be a hundred and fifty percent of this year's . Because you add fifty percent to the hundred percent and a hundred plus fifty is a hundred and fifty. So the output is going to be a hundred and fifty percent of what is was last year. The decimal equivalent of a hundred and fifty percent is one point five O or one point five. Next year's output is to be one point five times this year's. So you multiply this year's output by one point five and it'll give you next year's output. Alright? You add on that fifty percent or whatever it happens to be to the hundred percent which gives you the new figure. You change that into a decimal that is what you multiply by. So, let's have a look. If something is increased by fifty percent it is multiplied by one point five. A new town plans to increase it's population by fifty percent during the next five years. If the present population is eighty three percent calculate the planned population in five years time . So what are you gonna multiply that by? One point five. Right! So it's eighty three thousand and what do you get? One two four five O O. That's right. One hundred and twenty four thousand five hundred. Now, calculate the new populations when these populations are increased by fifty percent ? Now, you can give the answer in this form you needn't write it out in full. So, what you're gonna do is to multiply sixty four point eight by Haven't got anything. one point five and that'll give you an answer which you will write down followed by the word million. Alright? So, sixty four point eight multiplied by one point five Ninety seven point two. Right! Ninety seven point two. Good! Now this one. That's fifty eight point eight. A fifty eight point eight million. And C? Eighty nine point seven million. That's right! Okay. An airline is to increase all it's fares by seventeen percent . Now this erm illustrates the increase. There's your hundred percent it's got to go up by one point seven to a hundred and seventeen percent. One hundred and seventeen is one point one seven. So you multiply your hundred by one point one seven and you get one hundred and seventeen. The new fare is one hundred and seventeen percent of the old fare. The decimal equivalent of a hundred and seventeen percent is one point one seven. Move two decimal yo decimal points down those two places, alright? So to get the new fare you multiply the old fare by one point one seven. The old fare multiplied by one point one seven gives you the new fare. That represents a seventeen percent increase. So at three,before the seventeen the percent increase the fare from London to Feraccas was five hundred and fifty pounds calculate the new fare after the increase . Six O three point five. Right! So that's six hundred and forty three pounds fifty pence Fifty. isn't it? Right! F four. If you want to increase something by forty five percent what do you multiply it by? Four point five. One if you're increasing it by forty five percent if it was a hundred percent and you increase it by forty five hundred percent Oh it'll be nought point No. A hundred percent plus forty five percent will be what? A hundred and forty A hundred and forty five. five percent. Right? Now what's that of a decimal equivalent? One point four five. Right! Alright? So, if you want to increase something by forty five percent what do you multiply it by? One point erm four five. Think in terms of putting a one in front of that and then moving a decimal point two places and it's one point four five. So okay, F four A is one point four five. Alright? That's the first, that's your answer to that first question. F four A was one point four five. Now it says No! Just one point four five. Oh yeah. A hundred and forty five percent is one point four five, alright? So now it says increase twenty eighty pounds by forty five percent. So you're gonna multiply the twenty eight by? One point four five. Right! Forty point six. Forty pounds sixty, right. Right! Right! F five, now all of these you've got to increase e something by something there so you've got to change each of those percentages you've got to think of it as added to a hundred and then the decimal equivalent. So what are you gonna multiply the sixty seven by? One point six two. One point six two. Right! Good! One O eight point five four. That's right, one O eight point five four and it is in killogrammes. That's right. Right. Right! So F six A. If you want to increase something by seven percent what do you multiply it by? Er nought point seven. Sorry? Say it again. Nought seven, one point nought seven. Yeah, one point nought seven, that's right! So your ar answer to A is one point nought seven. Good! So now you increase sixty five pounds by seven percent. Sixty nine point thirty five. Sixty nine pound thirty five pence. Right! Good! Okay, now F seven's gonna be the same. Increase ninety two pounds by three percent. That's right. Nine pound four seventy six. Good! Right. That's right. Good! Right! Alfred's salary is eighty thousand four hundred and twenty pounds and Alberta's is seven thousand a hundred and eighty four Alfred has a twenty two percent increase and Alberta a thirty eighty percent increase who earns more after all this ? So what you've got to do is to put down Alfred's Alfred and put his new salary down and then you have to Alberta and her new salary and see which is which is the most. So you're going to look for Oh, tell me again ! Alright. So Oh . so right, eighty four two nought multiplied by Erm eight that's right. So what's that, ten two seven two forty? Yeah. Put a, put the forty down cos it's forty pence. Right! Yep! That's good! Now, Alberta's. Right! So, earns more afterwards? Alfred. Right! So Alfred is the answer. Right! Oh, we're coming to negative numbers. Have we done negative numbers? No. No. Right. Positive, negative numbers can be marked on a number line which extends in both directions. You can do some simple calc calculations by thinking of a number line, for example, two, minus two, plus five means start at minus two then go up five so you'll finish at three. So minus two, plus five equals Three. plus three . Right? Minus three, minus two means start at minus three then go down minus two, so minus three and minus two is minus five . Alright? Now, before you right them down just tell me what they are and then we can go back and write them down. Here you've got, minus four and plus three. That's minus one. Good! Minus four and plus six? Two. Plus two, right. Yes, two, yeah okay. So write them down cos yo you obviously can do those alright. It's plus two minus one Minus one , yeah. Minus It's two. Yeah, two. Now two minus five? Minus three. Minus three. Minus one minus three? Minus four. Right! Minus six plus two. Minus four. Right. And three minus eight? Minus five. Right! The number line method works when you have to add or subtract and ordinary positive number plus three means go up three, minus three means go down three. But it does not tell you how to do four plus minus three or seven minus, minus three, for example but it does not tell you how to do four plus minus three, or seven minus minus three where you have to add or subtract a negative number. Adding a negative number. Think what happens if you start with four and add on different numbers. Four plus three, as the number you add on goes down so the answer goes down. Four plus three equals seven four plus two equals six, four plus one five, four plus nothing equals four, four plus minus one is three cos you're coming down here, three two, one, nought, minus one, minus two, minus three, minus four, minus five. So as the numbers that you add on get one less so the answers get one less. So, four plus minus one is three, four plus minus two is two, four plus minus three is one, four plus minus four is nothing, four plus minus five is minus one. What is important is that you realise that that number is minus one that number is one plus one if you like but you don't need to say it but if th any, if the sign isn't there it's assumed that it's plus. But that number and that number are two different numbers. They're as different as one is from three. That is a different number from that, that is a different number from that. And that number is minus one. Don't think of it as taking away one thinking of it, think of it as minus one, a number. That is minus two that is minus three that is minus four, that is minus five. You've done some algebra haven't you? Found out the value of X well you can X equals minus five. And that is a value for X, it equals minus five and minus five is a number. So, try and remember that, that that is a number in it's own right. Now when you start thinking of what to do you've got plus four and you've got minus three if you take the smaller digit, now that digit is four, that digit is three if you take the smaller digit from the larger digit, you take the three from the four you get one and the answer is whatever sign that larger number is. When you've got two numbers that are both, all pluses, four and two is six, four and one is five, four and nothing is four, four and minus one means you got plus four minus one, is one less than four, it's three. You've got four plus numbers, you got two minus numbers which leaves you with two plus numbers. Let's go on and see whether you can pick it up. Write down the next two lines of a pattern of the bottom of the opposite page . Notice that four plus minus one has the same answer as four minus one. Four plus minus two has the same answer as four minus two and so on because the plus and minus gives you a minus. So we've got four plus minus one is three, four plus minus two is two, four plus minus three is one, four plus minus four is nought, four plus minus five is minus one what's going to be the next one? Four plus Minus six Equals? makes minus two. Right! So write that down in your book now safely. A is A two, write down the next two lines. So you got four plus minus six is minus two, then you'll have four plus minus seven is gonna be? Minus three. Right! Okay? So let's go on. Adding minus N is the same as subtracting N adding the minus number is the same as subtracting it. So copy and complete these . So write down A three A. Five plus minus three equals five minus three equals? Two. Two. Right! Two plus minus six is the same as two minus six which is going to be? You got plus two minus six Four. Mm? Four. You take the smaller digit from the larger digit so you take the two Eight. from the six and it gives you four but then you give the sign of a larger so it's minus four. Alright? Now this is minus three plus minus four which is the same as minus three minus four. Now you can, those are both the same sides so you're gonna en add them together and give it the sign that is common to both. Minus six. Minus? Six? Three and four? Seven, sorry! So , alright? Minus seven, yeah? Happy? Right, so A four,work these out . Now if you can do them then just put the answer down. Six plus minus three is the same as six plus and a minus give you a minus, so it's the same as six minus three which is? What's six minus three? Three. Three! Right! You take the smaller digit from the larger digit, so you take three from six gives you three you give the sign of the bigger number which is a plus. Now this time you've got two minus five. Yeah. You take the two, the smaller digit from the larger digit but you give the answer the sign of a larger digit. So it's? Minus Minus three! Alright? Yeah? Okay, you got minus one and a minus four. Minus four. No, you got a minus one and a minus four they're both the same signs, cos it's minus one, minus four they're both the same signs so you put them together four and one make? Five? And you've got Minus one. minus , so they're minus five. Let's just have a look at if we've got six and four we can have six plus four or you can have six minus four we can have minus six, minus four or you can have minus six plus four. Now that's a plus six and a plus four what's the answer? Ten. Ten. Nice and straightforward. Both the signs are the same. So you add them together and you give it the same sign. This one what's the answer to that gonna be? You've got a minus six and a minus four. Both the same signs. Ten. Can't be the same as that. They're both minus. Those are both plus so we call it plus ten these are both minus so the answer is? Ten. Minus ten. Alright? If the signs are the same you add them together, you give the ssssa the sign that they're both the same as. Now, here you've got six minus four now what's six minus four? Two. So that equals two. Now here you got minus six plus four take the smaller from the larger and give it the sign of a larger. Minus two. Right! Does that help a little bit? Let's do another one. Let's do erm eight plus three eight minus three minus eight, minus three, and minus eight plus three. Let's see if we can do those. What's eight and three? Eleven. Right. What's minus eight and minus three? Minus nine. No! Minus eight and minus three? Both the same signs. Minus eleven. Minus eleven. Now this is easy, eight minus three is? Five. Five. But this is a minus eight That's five, yes. plus three, it's minus five. Alright? Tear that out and keep that by your side because that gives you all the four possibilities. Alright? When the signs are the same if they're two pluses you add them and it's plus if they're both minus you add them and it's minus here you take the smaller from the larger and give it the sign of a larger. Three from eight is five, that's plus five. Three from eight is five, but that is minus, so it's gonna be minus five. Okay? So keep that by your side and see how we get on. So we've what were we doing? A B D! This one here is it? Minus two plus minus five. Which is minus two minus five. Minus two plus the minus gives you a minus, so you got minus two, minus five. Er, minus seven. Minus seven. Right! Now here you've got nought and a plus minus gives you a minus, so it's nought a minus four? Minus three. Right! Good! Three minus three? Three Nought. minus three. Nought. Nought, right! Minus five minus two? Minus three. Erm Minus and a minus. Same as that one, look. Minus two, minus five. You got that one right. What was that? Minus two and minus five. Seven. Is minus seven. Right? So here you got minus five, minus two which is? Minus seven. Minus seven. Now here you got seven minus nine? Take the smaller from the larger which will give you? Seven from two, nine is two and that number is a minus so the answer's going to be a minus, so it's gonna be? Minus two. Minus two. Alright? There we are, are you okay? Did you get any more? No I haven't No I've just picked it up Oh I see, mm Some money in the, something of Yeah I just saw the headlines with it, I didn't, I haven't actually read it, no, yes I must have a look at that There has been really, a very sharp frost this morning, the erm, the park is white and the roofs are white his own erm stability don't you really don't you? Retired of course he's no, no longer, mm I think it must be, you know, he's probably building this wall all over I suppose people object to the wall Do you know, I don't think I've ever seen that before where the robin has gone up onto the seeds Oh they don't often do that no They've been inundated with them I expect I've seen another one, the address for it is would you believe? Is it so? N N W gosh Oh this should be interesting this is from the A A erm travelling abroad you know Oh yeah useful because erm, I'd still love to do another trip abroad you know, go down to France go to perhaps What's Molly's telephone number? Is it O, two, is it's yes Oh this wasn't yesterday No this was the thirty first of January, it was fifty two minutes, two pounds, one, two pounds eighteen pence. Well I've been very good I've not been phoning anybody else Well actually it, it is down this quarter, it is down this quarter, because our erm, our total last, last quarter, the balance brought forward was seventeen pounds fifty five and this time it's six pounds seventy six, so we've reduced the erm the deficit so it is down The er that was I mean, that was, there's a couple you know one to Bridget and one to erm Demelza obviously that we, we phone them up and that's fair enough, you know but, I was just interested in how one and, yeah, well didn't we phone her and hadn't she had all that trouble, she'd had shingles and Oh yeah and she was feeling very depressed wasn't she so that was that was it that was probably what it is Yeah and I'd forgotten that I'd spoken to her the other night yeah no, no the total of current charges was fifty seven pounds and we pay sixty eight pounds in to pay, mind you that isn't so good when I look at it cos there four lots are going this month, this quarter, still never mind eh? Alright if we've done it in this quarter Well yeah I mean it, it er Happened that way it just happened that way you know the twentieth of November and there's the nineteenth of February Yes so it's nineteenth of February Yeah, twenty pounds has gone in and that's when it went in yes, yes Mm, mm But when is the phone call the phone calls, er, well the seventeenth of February looks to be the last itemized one And where was that to? That was to Bridget well no that was only last night before last wasn't it? This Might do that then, if we've got the money this is up to the eighteenth ah, ah, this is up to the eighteenth This is the twentieth, yes it was the nineteenth eighteenth of February nineteenth I phoned her It just didn't get in, right another big one as well But that one the other night I don't mind it having been so big, because it was sort of helping my conscience Yeah, is the, there's a leaflet here about B T you see and they you, you know the erm the O eight nine eight numbers which are these erm Yeah any entertainment sort of thing or, or like you ring up best on the thing Yeah the charge to call an O eight nine eight number from any phone other than a pay phone is thirty six pence per minute at cheap rate and forty eight per minute at all other times, over half of this money is paid by B T to the business providing the informational service Yeah, yeah so, you know, it's making a profit to all the people that are using that The best will get a profit Aye that's right Unexpected, strange Strange strange strange strange oh dear on your well that's not surprising It's making it difficult to save money Mars your ruling planet normally endows you with drive, but as Saturn grows nearer your energy level will decrease now how about that? Mm Do it to me Capricorn this is an extremely significant time, a close relationship has undergone a complete transformation in the solar eclipse of the sun, you may feel insecure this week I always feel insecure but only temporary oh good increasing security and money, investment are proving sound, there is no need to worry about my expenditure Oh Oh good, shall I go out and have a rave up shall we? Mm My health, I am feeling strong and looking confident on the outside, so you must try and feel it on the inside oh dear the planets are on your side this week for love, needless to say oh best on the nineteenth money, finance has become a little shaky as Saturn the planet of restriction approaches to Venus on the twenty sixth, this is not a time for speculation. Health, living generally, are enjoying good health, however those of you who are born in earlier to re-think your diet and the end of September as well I should think If you're thinking of going to France this year you'll be deli , you'll be delighted to hear that we're currently offering a three week inclusive holiday in the South of France for the price of two weeks, ask at your local A A shops for details of this and the free ferry crossing offer Oh Oh so do we want three weeks in France? Where to in? I dunno, I mean it's erm We're going to France of course I know we are then and if we book. if we book er, any, er, erm, a deal with them through P & O European Ferries, if we book one car and a person on a standard return fare crossing, they'll give you a free five day return to be used on the same route in the autumn them are the deal with exclusive to the A A so don't just get across once, cruise across twice Mm Hello right oh dear good morning I'm glad to see there's another one as idiotic as mine It's embarrassing isn't it? That's a beautiful sight isn't it? Oh dear the colours of the trees reflected in the lake, everything is beautiful and the gulls and it's so still that would be a mega painting wouldn't it? That is beautiful oh good morning Thanks Well put it on there No show you put away like that going to this erm, what did he say? The erm Oh yes I think it was You know I very carefully picked up my glasses and put them in the case and put it in my in there Mm, mm Is this the new marmalade? No No it's mm mains water burst which was between Church Road and erm Devon Square Yeah South West engineers were called in to try and to trace the leak in the mains pipe and after identifying it they carried out the repair work on Saturday and Sunday, but while at the scene early on Friday they smelled gas, and the British Gas South West whose workmen has discovered a kerb side leak, they worked throughout the night in there to cut away the damaged pipe repaired to make it safe Strewth For three days out going traffic was deserted by Devon Square and vehicles heading into the town from Penn Inn were filtered into a one lane of the dual carriageway and diverted along Station Road and Lower Queen Street God So that's what they did at Devon Square, that's why that was all that, that people came up East Street and then had to go down Devon Square and back out Yeah you know the road we came out of You know you saw an advert as we turned into Devon Square, building plots for sale Devon Square, oh yes, yes, yes, mm That's, that doctor's surgery Oh is it? Yeah numbers twenty five, twenty six of the junction of Torquay Road is for sale with a building plot in one of the gardens, the premises being used for many years as doctor's surgery ancillary accommodation and car parking, the property will be available when the doctors move into the new practice home in joining Cricket Field Road car park Yeah that's what it said, mm Mm detailed plans have been approved for a single storey dwelling in the garden on one of the houses condition on the surgery reverting to living accommodation, the houses would have considerable scope for use as offices subject to planning or paramedical use especially where large car parking areas are required, the whole is available at two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, but offers may be considered for number twenty five with the garden and parking area building plots to the agent Oh, the whole of two hundred and fifty thousand Yeah I reckon you'd, the building plot itself would of erm, and I've seen them advertised, for about fifty thousand pounds Yeah that's right, mm You were saying this morning on the end of the news you were talking about the four man Yeah thing and they were saying it started already and the Austrians were in the lead at that time Oh You might get it on erm Ceefax Mm On there you see it does say six o'clock Olympics today the first two runs in the four man bobsleigh, sport on Friday at two twenty five Mm with winter Olympics that have to run in the four man bobsleigh It just, it just said Olympic three, nine, one, but there's nothing on here at the moment now No, well, he, you know, just at the end when they're giving the last news just before nine o'clock Three nine five erm, said that it'd started already, erm whoever was doing the erm, whoever was doing the sport and that with the bob, he had said he could of dropped in a note to say that erm started already and at that stage, erm Oh Mark Tad has lost, a lot of ground to make up for Britain only setting the eighth fastest time and crewman only clocked fifty eight point four nine O to being handicapped by a poor start number of ten Oh they went down at ten? set the pace for Austria with the , track record run of fifty seven point seven four and the second bob is fifteenth see I mean they're, they're, they're fifty seven, eight for nine against fifty seven, seven, four, so I mean they're not half a second then, I mean they were, they were first in the two man and then they dropped six after one run so Yeah so I mean it's erm Mm you can make it up obviously We could do, yes, yeah we'll do that Better, have a better selection I would think Okay well I I just happen to see the Yeah the advert for them, well we'll go out there first thing, I mean we'll go out there first and then we can come back and get a card and we should know whether we've got to get one here or not shan't we? Yeah, buy sixty varieties of fuchsia cuttings, thirty nine pence each, they're under three pounds fifty Oh they're doing, you know here Well that might not be a bad idea to get the cuttings now because er that lot will be cheaper than I reckon of we'll see it now Yeah mm the frost is going fairly rapidly now, oh I know what I meant to do, I'll go and do that now You were going to feed the Yeah I got the, I've got to put erm seed out as well cos that's gone Daffodils Daffodils Yeah, cos they're quite tall there aren't they? Yeah, it looks as if they've just been sort of put in in a heap Well I don't understand how they're like that cos I mean there's, this side of the pot hasn't got any and I would of thought I would of put them in Spread them out Yeah, so perhaps they've moved That looks nice Yes the white's all gone, I mean the, the playing fields smart that are along here were absolutely thick white Mm this morning but it's all gone except for where in in the shadow Yes, yes, yes, yes you can just see it's left the shadow of the trees, yes Oh I meant to switch me pump off, no, still I think it'll be alright cos there's water in the erm, in the pond is alright, just won't be able to go through the waterfall Well we're going just out here and then we're coming back aren't we? Yeah I wonder if they might have anything don't know whether they sell other than the time No they don't do normally but I, I'd like to go and ask there some time whether they did Oh that's the one for sale which I saw advertised in the paper today Did you? Mm oops There's cows Mm, one was, I don't know whether they both were, were they? Well I would of said so, but Perhaps they were , mm looks like it don't it? Are you returning Doreen and today? Because they're saying because their kitchen is in absolute uproar Oh is it? they're going out to eat each day you see I see and erm I don't think I can, you know want to invite them back to our place here, so I told them I can't but erm I suppose we could always go out with them, if they were going out you know, if they haven't made any other plans Well yes we could do that well he doesn't seem A car to be in a very great hurry able to get up any faster perhaps he'll be alright on the flat I've seen some as well in erm some way, I looked in and this weekend they've got sort of erm vegetables in including one carrot or yes try this weekend ourselves to see what's there Mind you we've now caught up with some more traffic which is going even more slowly. Well he's rushed on now you see, that fellow has in the pick-up truck I mean, did you see him? Yes I did See the pick-up truck? Yes he's caught up with two more cars Cars, I actually saw those on the side because of that well never mind it's a nice morning Yeah we're not in any desperate hurry This one in front has obviously got a fear of going more than forty miles an hour that's for sure oh Oh he's pulling in thank goodness for that mm probably belongs to the yes it does you see Mm And there's quite a few wasn't there? Yep Mind, must of re-done those toilets or something cos look they've even got a disabled Mm so they have, yes Well I got six trailers and four bush ones Yeah yeah, five different plants, two of each And that's, that's ten is it? You've got ten That's ten and I've bought that parsnip, it's only eighty nine, there's three plants there Oh and if there's plant out in the sun for one we can put one in a pot and keep it in the kitchen Ha, I've just been looking around things that So you haven't bought anything? I have, I haven't seen anything Right, okay well then we'll go into market or Tesco's right Yes it's nearly opening time Yeah no, they've got them in the garden yeah, they've got them in the garden anyway haven't they? Did you say you wanted some pot some, or did you get them? Well I got a couple and I thought well I'll wait till I go out to Tregole now, they're probably cheaper there than anywhere I just happened to see these selection of pots no I think there these fancy ones more no they've got ordinary ones here but I mean these, are a whole lot expensive than they were at W Smith's, yes, erm I just don't believe this price no I suppose they're three for one fifty nine, but that's the size I got That works out at fifty P What? That works out at fifty P Yeah, well I paid forty forty nine I think or something like that And as you say they'll probably be cheaper at Cheaper at Tregole, yes right Do you want them now if you wanted them? No I mean I'm alright for the moment, I've got those two Oh Put the potatoes in the bottom Two thirty nine please Hello nice to see you How you keeping alright? Fine, yes, yes, mm a bit of a nip in the air this morning Yes it's nice though isn't it? I like it like that It was very sharp this morning first thing It was because when I came up it was minus one in the car, cos I got er, oh thanks, I've got a temperature thing in the car Aha and I haven't seen that for a while No but it's lovely you know when we were coming past the playing fields, it's erm I didn't there's ten there Thank you Are there some trailers? Oh yes I can see they're trailer Mm, mm And this as well? No, this is mine, I'd better pay for my own Four thirty nine please How much? Four Four thirty nine please, oh that's not nice is it having to pay for your own I don't think it is either We'll have to a nice red erm Thanks very much you know a red flower pot plant for somebody who's got a ruby wedding this weekend, but there's nothing up there, not much at all, Azalea's are sort of all off you know Not fancy a Polyanthus they're very pretty and they come in erm a box No, yeah I saw those, yes , yes but erm you know erm put them in one of those and yes they look really nice in the red containers Mm Do you want me to show you what they look like? Erm well look, let's get rid of these We had this one you see put together and it looked quite nice, it all in reds You gonna try and put them in there? Well I try Here's a bag look Now if I can put them in here, it'll stop these falling over, providing they don't get squashed with them let you have that one Thanks One O six please thank you Whoops Always doing that No, me I'll just go and look and see what this looks like Yeah okay Okay? Yes I'm waiting, my wife's gone back to be tempted I think she wants your advice How much is it worth? Two ninety nine Right Now can you see this, she, she just put that together, now that does look quite nice doesn't it? Yes that does look nice, yes I think so But if we sort of, you know, she said, you know look around and arrange something yourself Well I think that, I'm not sure the white doesn't set it off Yeah, but I want a better white bigger than that one Oh I see what about a pink? That's rather pretty isn't it? That was the one I liked the look of And another pink There's one there look Yes or this one? or that one, yes Mm, it's a bit tatty perhaps in places that one, that one's coming out, what do you think? Which one? That, that one there? Yeah, or this one I think the other one looks rather pretty This one? Right Is it, is it or is that the one you said that Well it's one flower that's probably gone, but take that off really That's got buds in it there? Yeah, okay, put that one back there then What do you think? Yes, fine, now you want it in the red one and not the silver one, yes? Well I think the red Yes well I think so, I think so alright That's the erm some of these There's not much red there is there? Not much flower there is there in that one, look, or is there? No, no, we could do with changing that Oh Let's see if we can get a, see there's a whole lot of buds as an example in that one isn't there? Yes, that'll do okay? Fifty five each, I don't know how much I think she said two ninety nine And that's ninety nine and four How much each are they? Sixty five, so that's two sixty and ninety nine Yeah, but I think it's two ninety nine for the whole lot Oh is it? Yes look, under the, under the bottom Oh yes, yes it says that yes That's your change, thank you Erm and erm, at least these look a bit Oh that's alright These are ten P each and the other's twenty two Are these blood oranges?

Well I dunno, you aren't bothered about a job are you? I don't think so. Well if if you don't want it say no Bev! It's not that I don't wannit. What is it then? I mean it's not two pound! So Leave it then. Leave it. Well no, because I've gotta give it Yeah I know, but it's no good if you're gonna get yourself uptight about it! Just gonna go and on though aren't you? Well you can always say you can't do it, you've got divorced innit? I I, there's no point Bev if it's gonna bother you! I'm telling you now! I thought you were yesterday. Ay? I thought were a little bit uptight. Well it's not that I'm uptight. What is it then? I think it's because I haven't done it for so long Yeah. Well,cos if it's any good,. I want it! I don't wanna be a failure! Who knows! Exactly! And the only way I'm gonna know is if I take it. Mm. God it's not the right time of the bloody month! You got a couple of letters here. Have I? Yeah. Where? Oh! Oh one's a . Well I should make your mind up Bev, here and now. You really must! If you prefer not I'll, I'll say No! I want it! I know you want it Bev but it's no good getting yourself uptight! It's no good at all! No good at all! Just waffle on and be done . It's to be expected really. Yeah, but then fifty nine thirty two. What? Well that's erm cheque erm . Well that's what I was waiting for weren't it? And then I'll get my old fixed. Well no, you must make your mind up love. Real last. Yay or nay I mean there's only a possibili , what is the thing you don't know how to do? Well, the word processing. But that's not it,i What is it then? I mean, it seem to me it would be an ideal one if Well it would! if, if, from what she says. It would! So you take the bull by the horns or you don't! Yeah. Or you don't. But if yo if yo let it get you down then you don't. It hasn't got me down. Mhm. Well that's what it is, apprehension's made that happen. Yeah. Certainly. And you don't want that . Well, I say, he tend to go at eleven and three, so think about it. Yeah, you're right. You see it's not really for me to do. I mean, from the sound of it she's answers the telephone, does a bit of typing and That girl in there though? Mm. Does a bit of typing. Oh I want it! Don't get me wrong. So why not? But the you gotta expect, there's bound to be a bit of apprehension. I understand that totally. But I think it's take the bull by the horns Oh yeah, and I mean let's face it you might not like it! You might not you might get there and you might say oh I don't like this! But that can be the same anywhere couldn't it? Yeah! If you come up my place. Which I'm sure you wouldn't like would you? Ha! Okay I'm going out now. Well I suppose if you want to work then the first one is The first ones always can be the worst one! Ay? Well, the first one's always gonna be the worst one! Mm! Certainly is! But I say, I'm sure your capable of taking the bull by the horns. Oh God, yeah! I've done it before it's just I haven't done it for so long! Oh well! I mean er that's why I never done the yesterday. I mean, it's not that she's probably gonna go after it but I, you know, who knows! I mean they know up there because of the, of theirs. But they'll probably rather annoying at the moment. Innit? Yeah. Well I think it's If you want it. Oh, I'll be alright now. I shall be alright now cos of Val. Yes, that's right. I mean, as I say, you might get there and you might hate it anyway. Yeah, I might not even get it bu No. No, another he said was that bloke came in later. What was that man's name? Clive Clive? Clive? I dunno, it was either Clive or Richard I think. I mean unless they get a temp from an agency they gonna want somebody aren't they? Yeah. Sounds to me as though they're just sell stuff, I I don't know! But it sounds to me as though it's taking something off the telephone, which is simple innit? Yeah. And erm a bit of couple of letters typed. I mean, the re at the least you could go and have a look I suppose if Is it somewhere ? He never said. He honestly never said. It seemed to me it were the type of place you could sit and do your knitting. Yeah. If she's sat watching them she's pregnant but if she'd have sat watching Neighbours and she weren't able to was she ? And he did say to me well he has spoken to me about it, he did say answering the telephone. He said that. Mm. As I say, I've only met her the once. And she come up in the car for him once. But I mean the first step is always the hardest. I mean, if that don't only apply to you. No. But er if you want it an and it's then no harm in going and having a look! Is there? Like I say, the choice is yours hundred percent! You don't have to. I want it but Well the butt of it then has gotta be go over. Mm. I mean if, if she wanted you to go out there today, just if then the sensible is to pick up a taxi. Yeah. Well, then I know where it is. Certainly! I mean I went, I'm i if it's the place where we said it is then, I mean it I know we went through Thicket , yes I do! Cos I saw their horses and which I think are Moira's. But I mean you know what I'm like in a car I just sit there and then then your father turned in and there was all these, where we went to get the carpet, you know? And that is as much as I can sort of remember. But I really don't take much notice anyway, sat in a car. No. I don't. Still as I say, no,th it's, it's a fair comment to say it's to be expected. But if you can overcome that you know, by saying ah what the hell! It's either this or nothing which, which it is and if you want it I mean Lesley's not bothered about it cos he's giving her seven hundred quid a blooming month! Well neither would you if yo , somebody give you seven hundred quid a month! Neither would I! For God's sake! I wouldn't get up at six, put the washing out and then go up there! Thinking . But there again, one week you might, one month you might get a one month he might give her that and bugger all the next month! Well she says it's guilt money and that is possible. Mm. But, I think you're quite right in what you say. Quite right! No doubt about that. You never know with what she said anyway. Unpredictable. But I mean, knowing her the the the sa , the money she's had she will erm certainly look after. Mm. You know? I mean she's been living off what seventy three odd quid has she? Yeah. So I mean there isn't anyway in the world that she's gonna bank seven hundred quid a month! No way at all! She'll er make the most of that because she won't possibly money for erm Mhm. she'll want money for the deposit and and whatever she gets. Has there been much noise today? No, but their dogs and that. Got a lot done this morning then? Well I did it on the way . Why not? And stupid git there should of popped those in there! Really stupid! Could of done that easily couldn't I? Yeah. There's plenty time weren't there? What did they think of the brochure then? The Yeah! Yeah, they did like it. But I say, you have to be there to appreciate it don't you? Oh yeah! You know? Sorry? I say, you might as well buy the other book. Mm mm. We can go on Sunday. Oh, it's going all morning. Been going all morning. Was she in there? Oh she was in there. She's very isn't she? Oh, well it's either that or she's just ignorant! I can hear it now. Wait till he's gone out now. I think they've all gone out. Do you? Well the red car innit? Yeah but I mean I only her. I'll try her again and this time let it all come out. Impress on them that you don't wanna come out with it short. Can you? Yeah. Lorna or somebody. Well we know, we know Lorna. But it seems to me that Gwendoline and Margarite that are scissor happy. Don't go in there . No I mean if the , one of the I think the situation I shall alright. will change totally and I Yeah. mean I don't know what this is. It's just going I back after five Well years. yeah, not so, so confident but if you don't make the attempt Then I shall be like this every time something crops up. And you've done this all before under worse circumstances. Yes. Oh well , I really do! But I think sometimes I mean you've either got to do what you do coming back from Germany I think you have to take the bull by the horns don't you? Oh yeah! And I tell you, I don't know what this is. Well I don't. Or if it's gonna occur but it seems to me it would, or sounds like it would be a simple let in to the Yeah. to the situation. Mm.. Erm that's only what I heard, that's all! I don't think it's a massive place that you know, I I just think it's like a warehouse thing. A . Yeah. A might be the word. I don't know! But it was no different from me starting work up here that time After so long after so long, which it was a long time. Course it isn't! It ju it's just the same. But in the end I had to do it didn't I? Well you have to do it. If the circumstances are such you have to do it. And er I say, that well purely taking the bull by the horns innit? Really? I know. It's for your own benefit because Yeah. whatever it pays if it's, if it's better will pay more than obviously what you're gonna get from either or. Then go in or Well I shall still get his. Yeah, I know you still get his. But I won't Well you ca I won't get the income. Mm mm mm. That's right. But nevertheless you know, if you could get it and you could manage it it will relieve the bloody boredom wouldn't it? Ya. Cos it is boring! Mm. Course it's boring! Boring for me! Because what is it Pardon me. and that's where it should be nice made a change didn't they? Yeah. You know? That's where it made a difference but I was sticking in all the blinking week I'll save that till he gets home but apart from That's rubbish innit? Well apart the radio but I expect they're gonna a radio of sorts you know? But er no I say, the choice is yours. Certainly! Well that, the first step's some when will have to be taken Well the longer I leave it the worse it'll get. Certainly will! But then, I mean a actually I mean as I said, Lesley ain't that bothered because of what he's giving her Mm. but at the same time she's got all lethargic cos Yeah. cos she won't even go out with Jenny, look! I mean, I say, still again, I don't know whether she swims or she doesn't but nevertheless it's an invitation out innit? Well she can go to the spa bit. Well any of it! Well even if you went and watched. Yeah! There was At least you're out. there was people watching over the balcony last week. I saw them! Yeah. But I say I believe in in one respect alright, she's got the car she can whip in and out but I do believe in another respect she's got to the point where she can't be bothered! No. And it's so easy to sit every day innit? too! Anyway, so might not get the opportunity anyway, so it might not arise. Well the point is, for a thing like that if somebody else knows somebody Yeah. and they're willing to take you on for x you know erm it just, a lot of it is word of mouth. Word of mouth these days. It is! Don't mean there's a what's a name in there, a waistcoat. What a mohair I think. Oh. But I dunno. That's your father. Mm, quite nice innit? Quite a different feel today. Mind, I get bored to tears with doing this every damn day! Bored out my skull! Right well if I ordered another, I order from the thing. Right. If I ordered another four Don't do it for Friday cos you'll be out. Oh yeah. Oh well stay away from Friday then. m What I can't understand is, it happens all the time my telephone next door Yeah and somebody must try and get in touch with her in the evening if she's not in. They must realize she does work But I mean we've had this for blooming weeks now ain't we? Er nine weeks It's either the phone or the dogs or the child Mm when you can hear the telephone like that in here, there's no wonder you can hear the rest of them No cos that telephone was in the hall It surprises me Mm leave it, leave it ringing so long What on the other end? Yeah Mm, that was stupid yesterday though Mark putting that on Mm god dear me, who ever even thought of it look stopped now stopped Yeah, dependent on, I mean that's twice since I've been home innit? It rang about three times this morning before you got here Obvious they're away then innit? I don't know I mean sometimes it goes and I think she's in there don't you? Yeah I wonder if all the dogs are in there? Probably I thought, when I went and opened the windows I saw the other one but I didn't see the they wouldn't have room in one car for four dogs would they? I don't think they take the dogs out in the car for a run, you know, like a lot of people do No I don't think she puts them in the car it's not the sort of car that you do that with, not with four anyway, you'd imagine them having an estate car Mm wouldn't you? Yeah, something where you can put the bar up at the back Mm and erm Val has got one ain't she, for Just Yeah Is it a telephone? It's gotta be Yeah a telephone, what the hell's going on? Oh I don't know I reckon it's been brought into the front room because erm, if she shut that door for them, cos she shuts the animal in a, a room here there and bloody everywhere, it's stopped again now ain't it? She might of answered it, she might be in there. Oh that's twice, a hell of a lot of time but er But they said wet and windy, but that wasn't there was it? I think that was more up North. Oh, up North, right. Shall I just pop that back out? Yeah Okay. Is it open? Yeah. put anything. Put water in there. You gotta have Oh yeah. liquid haven't you? Oh! No, I mean don't be like .

Reading? Reading, she's, she got herself, I told you she got herself a place in Reading College, to do her, an English A Level,. Oh, Reading you see, I think of Reading, Berkshire. Yeah, that's right, Reading, Berkshire. Oh no, you didn't tell me. Didn't I? No. Oh, well she did . No, that would of stuck in my mind. Yeah. She moved down to Reading? She got herself a job in Reading college, she got somebody to take her down there and a place to get an English A Level, and Mary said it's a thing with her she wants to get this English A Level cos her father had one and she feels that is she could get and English A Level it would impress him, he, she spends her life trying to impress her father who doesn't really takes much notice of her,. Yeah. And she started off quite well there, she was a little bit erm lonely and missed her and everything but she gave the appearance sticking it out until I spoke to Mary last time when she said oh . She must of got a grant. She, she's there on Social Security which means she can only do part time education because if you're on the Social Security you have to available to do a job Yes. so that Which is reasonable isn't it? yes, so, so, that you can only do education part time. So Mary said she, she came back up to the, a little while ago she said she didn't get do something Mm, mm. and even an English A Level's not much good to her, yet she . She should do what Dinda done, I mean Dinda went to evening school for her computer Mm. A Level while she was working during the day Mm. This is, this is it. Paid for her to help . . Erm, living there because all can do at the moment, is work in a shop or a restaurant or something like that and she doesn't get paid as much as she'll get on Social Security so it's not worth it, It's terrible. it's terrible,awful showing her sense of responsibility and doing what she says she's going to do. Wouldn't she of done better to take erm a six month's course in secretarial skills? Well Mary said if I thought for a minute that she would stick at it, I would pay for her but Yes, yes . she won't, she's, she's just on the, oh I don't want to work in a boring office we've, we've tried to say not, you don't have to work, it's an in, it's an in to what you want Exactly , to do, you, you get into the boring office and sort of, yeah, yeah . it opens the door, it opens the door , that's why both my younger girls, I mean Diane's a different policy any way cos she wants to be a , but with the other two, who worked interest in computers and when they left college I gave them crash course in, in typing not in shorthand because they don't they don't need shorthand nowadays , Really don't need that now, no . but I find it useful. Well yes, but I mean, it, now they do audio typing and computing don't they, doesn't computing . Yes, yes, that's right, they use , yeah , but I insisted that it were open doors for you as jobs were so hard to get, I said it were open doors for you and it did it helped them both. Yeah,. Once you're keyboard, . keyboard something Mm. you've got a keyboard skill and they, they can teach you . these word processors and they were talking . Oh yeah, oh you talk to him? Yeah. I think I . Anyway it, it doesn't alter the fact that if she wanted to do something, erm,really . Last I heard she was living with her for . well she wasn't, she was according to her she, she was allowed to use pity, because she, she could, I said to Derek could have been so nice you and her, a little firm together working for the good of the two of you That's it. now all, all that's Mary But I mean, a lot of people don't glorify on the jobs they do, I mean Dinda she said you know, it's awful being the one who's getting all the all day long, kind of explained and help them with their problems, sympathise with, with something that doesn't work she'd much rather be outdoors than being a or looking after , but she said you know, it's, it's a secure job and these days I think well I'm not I run my own car and they don't really think that Well then, somehow other people seemed to be . Think she's absolutely,recession on, so many people Mm. all day long I'm getting phone call from . Mm Erm. People who,camcorder or a camera or a video, video camera, they do say that, that one microwave people don't seemed to have cut No. microwave a new vacuum cleaner or whatever, I mean all the things they make, music centre that is a luxury really. Most people are buying those sort of things I know it's one of the last things I'd would Vacuum cleaner, yes. Mm. Having been through the spate of using a clapped out vacuum cleaner that didn't do its job, and how different it is now Yes , that I've got one that works. I remember when Miriam got married they had nothing Yeah. they had their hi-fi . It was the only thing they had, they'd got nothing except , I think it was . I didn't get a vacuum cleaner. , we, we got our washing machine washing machine, remember it, we used to bolt it to the floors Yes, yes. we, we weren't allowed to have that one, until we could pay for it outright. Yes. . Didn't have a fridge. No, no. Not until after we no , moved to Maidenhead. not until you could pay for it , you didn't do, go . Remember my washing machine where I used to turn the handle at the top, heat it up with gas Yeah,, yeah, yeah . and if I'd got something big and heavy you used to say to me bring it down and put it in my big machine. Mm I used to bring down quilts and my machine wasn't big enough and in any case I couldn't possibly lift them once they were No, no , full of water. no, but nowadays the, the machines don't take , mind you because it was take a lot of water, waste . Mm. Nowadays it's Don't they, don't they have I know, I know if I've got a towel in mine or a big thing and, and it's all happens to be on one side One side , of the, the drum and it starts to erm spin yeah the whole thing goes woof and it all seems Really . to move to one side, yeah, cos it's standing in an area and it isn't flat against . That seems rather something heavy. Mm, mm, Yes. . But I often look back and think well if was the girls who insisted that it's time mum had a proper automatic washing machine Yeah. and then only had it four years, but I used to it was, it's such a waste that washing machine, I think maybe I've done a few shirts hand washing and all the water, whereas in the twin tub I'd of done the light weights, heated the water up done the shirts and , erm, got the put in, maybe towels and then I'd put, re-heat the water if, if it wasn't really soiled and I could do either all the dogs stuff or, or my dusters Yeah, mm. and then after that you've got all the water left and it cleaned the sink as you as the pump pumped it out, you could go quickly with a brush round the sink and suds cleaned all the sink for you, or you could with your pail. Yeah, or, or even with the garden . Oh yes, I used to save it for the garden too. Now, now, with it, the one thing in that's it, and all the water's wasted, you can't re-use it for anything. No. I suppose I could if I could pull the machine out and were, were the pipe goes over into the waste I mean people do that in the Isle of Wight aren't they, were they've got to, need to Mm. they unhook their washing machine Oh yeah, yeah , and they put it into a, a an old bath or anything yeah an old tank yeah, so that they can save the water and use it for other things. yeah. Mm, once he said girls I will get your mother a proper washing machine, I agree she shouldn't move the heavy towels garden No. pinks. Pinks, yes we did get it, oh they are in I think I've seen him , I haven't. Abu Dabi was the place I was trying to think of I knew it was a funny name Aha. that's where he used to go out there the first one started in December . . All he has to do Abu Dabi Yeah. London Airport where he has to . Paddy has never had any body aboard the S E one eleven with a video camera has he?. They have, he has, what do you want it for?. Well, for Pete, I saw it advertised it's a pilot or whatever erm videos Mm. thirty pounds Wow . it's a two hour video with a it takes you through landing at Liverpool and somewhere else and studying. Oh really, aha. Mm, all the take offs and Yeah , all the checks aha . Oh . And I thought Pete will love this . Oh yes. He's actually done it with Paddy Yes. and I thought I wonder if somebody will ask, you know Paddy No, erm Paddy was actually flying the aeroplane that did it, cos he's landing and take off was so impeccable and he's training. , well, I mean he, he knows the one and only . Well exactly, but he trains other, other pilots on them first, thought they might of . No, he erm, I say with videos that they, they send a video over an Australian thing, this chap's the other two and one of them had a camera and he went aboard to test pilot it and he took the all around the place round er having flown six five minutes and he paid he tried to things that had gone wrong, whatever it was and erm, he, he, he's . , yes. Maybe they've taken it from that video . No, well, I shouldn't think so, but, but I should think they've done it on purpose, they've actually gone and done it. Yes. As a, as a . All I want to know is The backward countries have got more aeroplanes that we have. Well one of, one chaps got seven. Huh. . . That, those, those two that Paddy brought back from Australia apparently does it . One that queen use, they'd love that. Yeah, yeah. She . As far as I know that's, that's going out as well, erm in fact he went over to Dublin to get a bit of training erm idea in pilot . They're all up there, there won't be any left any where else. I . Yes,. Can't believe it No. it seems so big and impregnable. Oh dear but there was that was a video Oh . Oh me, I would of thought more and more people would fly rather rather than perhaps the business men aren't , looking over the old New Jersey, or New Walkie something like that , a veteran . A lot of the Americans did . Can't think why and I can't think why they should think they mustn't go on Pan Am cos Pan Am are a target No. any American airlines Mm. any British airlines could be a target. Mm . Mm, mm should know . . coats sitting on you? George smoking. I said look, Joan's had her eye on she doesn't smoke, Paddy doesn't smoke pipe on a chair. He doesn't smoke at all,. Certainly give them , yeah and I said Joan will tell you not only does her but the table that he sits on and the wall around it , Wall around it, yes , absolutely filthy, oh I can't be like it, I said she didn't ground it just dirt dirt from the dog running and the vacuum cleaner it does doesn't it? I said that's what it's for, yeah, yeah. If it, it wasn't dirty then it wouldn't be . So what I do is, I, I turn one off at night downstairs and I put one on in the bedroom Yes. I've got one in the bedroom, and er, in the morning I turn one of in the bedroom and try and remember to turn the one off in the turn the light out downstairs. their light. It's very difficult, it's very difficult at my age to remember all these . Oh if any one can fair enough. Oh put mine on the mantelpiece, I don't, I don't know whether they like to . Oh television attracts dust any way doesn't it? Yes . But I, I must . Takes forever, takes him forever. Yes Yes, cos he's got one of those erm, oh dear what's it called, it's got a big thing tube and stuff and it's got one of those erm bits round the outside it goes on what do you call those er, and you, you squeeze it don't you Oh yes , that's right and it comes down. I've got some of that down at Cambridge,got more control Yes and it's very hard to push any way Yes. this one it just comes out like soft rubber Mm. and you just fill in the gaps Yes, yes, when Paddy tried to do ours in the flat need to use small screw drivers to make the, the . Mm. and of course it was all squashed up either side, we have to wait until it's dry now. Yes. It's smelt to high heaven It does smell doesn't it? Oh, oh it's strong, he said and you shouldn't leave it till ten o'clock at night, then it's on a cold night and have to open the windows Mm. the bathroom window all wide open when I went upstairs to bath, I thought I, I . oh dear. When he wrenched his back he wasn't doing anything in the house, when he wrenched his back all he was doing was lifting the carton of the back seat of the car. . It shows that something stupid and it just went,spine, and he was sitting on the pavement out there for three or four minutes in agony, Really. had he done it when he was lifting, like putting the bath in or something, I could understand it Yeah, yeah. or put, lifted part of his precious machine. Yeah You ready for your lunch? Oh yawning. I thought really done all haven't done all that much, cos I was alone most of the time Mm, mm. The make you, sort of what were doing when making another member of staff, so there's a going on full time having free coffee like Dinda did, much change it to be , but I mean it's just there for free, all day every day, she's now ten penny piece in, they get a card, get a little pin pricked on, every time they used it up to twenty they get twenty cups of coffee on its card . no, they loose it so of course they have to go and buy another card . Every time I do the laundry I bet there's a coffee machine card in there, shirt pocket, there's two there this morning. Oh I guess that, that means that's all right when it, did you coffee machine . seventeen thousand pounds if he gave them a free cup of coffee. Well he, he, he given them a free cup of coffee it'll be alright, but he didn't, he gave, the machine took ten P pieces so he provided them with the ten P pieces to put in and then when it was full up he'd empty it out and give them all ten P pieces back So he was given them coffee. So he was, for it was, it was a perk, or something like that,I, I couldn't really understand what they, they were getting at . I couldn't understand it either. I thought that was absolutely . To charge him I mean, somebody gets a company car Mm. the tax man charges him, who is, who's got the use of the company car Yes, yes. doesn't charge the boss No, that's right, mm. Well I think expenses I'd should imagine that's written off against it. Well he, he said if they, if, if, some, get a visitor in and I give them a cup of coffee well that's all right, but I don't know if it's money or, or like maybe, maybe . But it seems to me it's the person, people drinking the coffee who are getting the perk, therefore they should have twenty pounds a year added for free coffee providers Mm. worth twenty pounds a year or whatever it is worth Well he he was saying that, that the boss was the one that provided the money that the chap was . So he, that was definite, yeah. If he was given them tokens or something like that, it would of been alright, but I, I, I a couple of weeks ago Perhaps now they're not doing it then . I've forgotten the details on it . Well imagine what Panasonic are going to own Yeah. giving out those great big blocks of , all getting as much as . Well, this, this is a lot of people, of er to erm . Oh I . he, he was sort of on loan to another company Mm. and they say film industry department, Wakefield somewhere got John's name out of the blue, so that, don't know anything else about it because he's, he's always been seen by you know , this, this other company, and he got three tax eighty seven, eighty eight, eighty eight, eighty nine, ninety, and one what, were the estimate was twenty five thousand pounds, and five thousand pounds Yes , and he hadn't even earned that had he? not a chance, he, he never even earned that much money in all his , no but I mean having, having had the income tax done that to you however ridiculous that it is you've got to do something about it , yeah and having been sort of helping . The finally he decided what he had to right back to say, you know, I, I, tell you this is how much I've earned Yeah this is how much tax I've paid, this is, I mean if you go on the dole too unless you've made a note of it there is no record of how much you've been paid on the dole, they, they give John the what he calls a giro, takes it to the bank and cashes it and there is no, no record of and when he's been on the dole. I mean he's got plenty of every single bit of papers that they're given all the time. Yeah , but the D S S must have it,. Well I, I don't know how keen they are on giving them out, just . . Actually it was lucky for us because when John rang up the For his firm. for his firm, erm, he said I'll, I will see to it, which she's doing at the moment but , but erm, I don't know how far At least it's got an end now with the others if he's on the film company, he's got an end now hasn't he now he's got . Yes I suppose so, but I feel sorry for Simon cos you see John and Geoff they can both go on the dole but Simon's is . The or, or anything so at the moment . . Any way the thing is erm, I hope only have a What he's, he's earns, er pay tax on everything he's earned Yeah never had a not for all the things No, no and er, he's been on the dole admittedly he did go on the dole If you're on the dole for part of the year, your own salary is do they add your dole money to the salary, charge you tax on that , Oh yes, oh not half you see so I think, not half I said to Paddy I think that they do that John will owe, owe them some money cos he'll owe them tax from all the doles . he can't tell them how much it is? Because er, I don't know whether Oh well that signature for it every time and it goes on his file every one has a file . Well I hope so , because he's been when he went Huh. He didn't get very much . So I, I don't think it's finished yet somehow, he don't seemed worried about it It seems that they chase somebody like John who, at the outside may end up after five years owing them perhaps a hundred to two hundred pounds Mm. and yet people like the Maxwell board Yeah, yeah. millions involved and other people who are running dodgy companies Yeah. going bankrupt and then starting up another company in another name Mm, mm which I don't think should be allowed, go right themselves off and leave lots of people that they owe money to and can't get it, they get threatened That's right and then they go and start again in the or something, it's some of them are all over again, start them off of course. that everybody without jobs . Oh the people that took over the . Mm. Ever such a charming family,green grocers nice enough people they have next door Mm. he said and I got on very well with them, have a chat and I used to help them when they came in they were West Indians which gave everybody a bit of a shock when running a local Spa Yes. , but erm,and I notice that quite often the shelves would be half empty,came here, I would stop on the way back from the school the bank and the butcher's and the paper shop over the road I could come in quarter to nine and I'm, you know, I, I was done and I said to my Arnold they're not going to sell much unless they put some money into filling the shelves surely Spa will back them, and he said I keep on telling them that I keep on saying to them if you don't put the goods there on display people are going to go over the road to Lipton's and and Mm, mm. eventually they went bankrupt, Florrie is an of mine, she used to work there part time and she always enjoyed it, she's been there say twenty years , she just came back from holiday and found the place is closed down and none of for the past er fifteen months he'd been there, that past fifteen months none of their part time staff had their stamps put on their cards, so for their, for their pension yeah , they've, they've got to put their National, National Ins Insurance stamps, erm, none of the Tax that they'd stopped from their wages had been paid to the tax man, so apparently there was I don't see how they've already paid their employer , they , it was P A Y E,not . . Yeah,but people can do it even in a little way Yeah. little local people, part time housewifes earn a bit extra to pay their mortgage or save up to go on holiday Yes. . . Yeah. . Not very fair is it? No it's not How that coffee machines any, any old machine well it's a small office, maybe a bigger offices have the vending machine, but every office will have a machine. I've usually been, been senior secretary, I've usually been the one in charge of the petty cash, which, sent out for proper coffee and the new kettle if the kettle blew it's fused and the and the tea pot and the tea bags and the, I just used to write a note in the, in the cash book Mm. and cash back in the box of the petty cash Yes. if I needed any I, I used to ask my boss or phone up head office and say petty cash is getting a bit low I've used a lot of stamps last week, they'd send me up a cheque and , never any question of they've provided us with tea and the pint of milk I use, I, I'd bring it in with me or ask the I suppose that they Yes, yes, ten minutes office time spent in the loo, mm Yeah might be strong . You see the leaves in our garden, imagine can't you with all those trees up the top, I give up on it. Ah. I saw a gadget the other day that's two, two plastic circles with handles on, mm, I think I paid about seven pounds and this was to gather up leaves and big lot of Mm, mm. look at it, it's isn't it? Mm. What I'll do pay out extra for two bits of plastic. that was a good idea if you can borrow next door's dustbin your own you'd narf get a lot of leaves up You would. you'd carry them quite safely round the corner or whatever you want, but I . Most of my leaves drop down and fall in the borders soil Yes, yes. Every time I think about it I'm either too busy or the weather's too rotten, when I'm not tired the weather's pouring with rain or bitterly cold or . Did I tell you where we planted the You did, did you? We did, yes,the two Rhododendron behind the and put them on the outside and then put the two bushes over there, the Mallow and the other one. oh great, great feel happier now. The, the last one that I bought was going to be easy, but oh . So you should have space for something sweet smelling outside those big patio doors That's right, I want some Lavender and Azalea and stuff like that, now , yes that sort of stuff. . Mm. evening, I used to go up there and er I always think of nicotine Yes , yes . They're not much to look at. put there . That might be , that one is one of the ones we moved in .. Mine's not very . One I had at Maidenhead was gorgeous. Gorgeous, the one I had . This one doesn't. It's a it used to be a,. In fact it was you I think who stopped me from pulling it up, I bought it as a, a stick from Bromley,in Bromley Mm. and I stuck it behind Anna. where the wall of An er Anna's garage. Oh I know, yeah. . . Anna was . And I stuck it in there and I, I figured it had been there now for what eighteen months and I think it was you who said oh give it another six months Yeah. give it another growing and I just thought stupid plant, and I've left it and it's grown into a beautiful,, didn't call it which now is supposed to before the other way round. . Yeah like my are no longer there There . Yes. Don't know why they keep changing their minds about it, honestly,people start . Yes change it to inches now . Even in kilos. Yeah. Even though I've been shopping through France Mm. Germany I still don't like dealing in kilos. Well you'll be over there. give you a hand. No, no, I'm not going to do any thing . Right, can I have a look at your paper then? Yes, darling,, Yeah , It's all upstairs on the Well there's always, there's always the next bit of garden, it isn't there when we, when we put the rubbish out, then Paddy says is that everything and I say well you know it's not, you know that it's going to blow up again as soon as you've come inside, but don't worry. I when you use Mm, that's right, yes, mm. . . Well yes, that's, that's . . Oh perhaps just as well. I do it with . Having a birthday in January . Yes, yeah. I said well how about a I said would you like candles on,. Oh, that would be nice er, and Have that Oh does it, I must say that'll be nice as long as, as long as you'll let us take . Probably expensive. Well not to worry if you go, go to the theatre I don't want eh I like . over the road Mm. as we, they keep it no nasty erm the costumes all fresh and clean Yes, yes . They used to have those girls that, the girls,she became erm well she was an , she, she was in erm Rushford, you . Was she? She's er, mm, the wife, you know, er what was her name Veronica? Veronica. she was her cos we always remembered her . . Yes I liked her. She was in the window. She used to be in the window and her sister, and I can't remember her sister's name, there was two of them, they, they used to do . Yeah I remember someone I thought it was just another T V. Well she had been on one or two things, not a lot on the television but er, we . That girls with a beautiful voice. Mm Oh probably can, yes. Oh that's the time going you know the and she might expect to stay for us, but best thing is to get the figures and we'll erm, we'll do the , give her the money, but erm I'm sure that he will love that, so would I. . I don't mind, whatever. box . , well I mean, I did do what you want, Penny and I would come along but I think you'd see better in, in a box. . what's going on here. Maybe, maybe you'll, you'll . Last time we went the, the came on and declared that it was your birthday and wished you a very happy birthday and you were standing up there, bouncing up and down. ,on stage sang happy birthday to you. And that . Going like that , ah she wouldn't do that now, would she? You're lucky. I think there was somebody called who came down the isle and gave a couple of balloons. Oh how nice, yeah, yes. I only mentioned it when I was walking the dogs . Oh yeah, yeah.. did she? Yeah. My little daughter was twenty seven Sunday. Yeah. Yeah who does all the in . Oh does she, I, I mean I can have a word with little kids always. Yeah, but it's tea leaves. Yeah tea leaves, tea bags, well they're suppose there've got . Oh, they must do I suppose, they . . Really, well I, I think I might pop down on the roses next year. I would . Warm, when it's warm enough to go out. I'd liked to find Mary something nice and pretty for Christmas, I don't know what to get. Can't you get . Well she did last year, she told us, but this year, well Paddy, Paddy bought her a book of quotations, which she, she quite liked it, but it's not a very attractive book, and we bought her a video of The Little Mermaid which we know she wants Oh yes, that's, that's a good idea. Yes, yes, erm, but I would of liked to have bought her something pretty, I can't think of what to get her. D'you want to drink ordinary one, right whip it out for me then please, I'll have to leave it there because some of this is, still out there, ta well that's not bad, time wise No Oh I bet these kids find this thrilling you know, don't you? God Barking dogs next door barking dogs next door again, so I shall, plenty of material shouldn't we? Subject to material god, yeah The annoying, the most annoying thing about it Yeah is, is if she tries she can make it quiet in there That's what she's supposed to do according to the Citizens Advice Bureau, is to control them so that she don't annoy the neighbours Mm Now Sunday when I had her about that terrific barking, your father was the first to say, look she stopped it Yeah but she lets them bark on like she lets the kids scream on, and that is today innit? I think basically what it comes down to, it doesn't bother her So why should it so she doesn't care about anybody else Mm It can't bother her Bev because the amount of noise that we get through the walls is so bad and she's in it, she's actually there with the animals barking, so she takes no notice whatsoever of them No she's probably bloody used to it after all the years she must of had them, she tells can't she tells me they're all old dogs But dogs whatever age don't Well make that noise the way she said it that day was, they're old dogs, they don't need the exercise and they don't bark, that is the impression, impression I got It's not true so Now what's that point to spend an afternoon here no point at all is there? Not a lot Well there isn't any more is there? They wanna get that paper out Sorry? Do you think that put that paper through the what out in the garage? Yeah I dunno, right let me do this and then I'll have a look I mean I've got to do this because I'm not sure of it, done now innit? Mm I wouldn't wanna do it tomorrow, well only later afternoon but I mean if I have to put ear plugs in at night to get some sleep because of them, surely the authorities have gotta say something about that Well well for god's sake, I mean I often wonder about people who make noise like this how they would feel if we did do the same, but I still say because we've done our polystyrene insulation she can't hear us, it's worked in the reverse ain't it? Probably Instead of us, you know, instead of it blocking out for our benefit, I reckon it blocked out for their benefit somehow a hell of a lot of insulation, in here Mm a hell of a lot really, normally you wouldn't have the vinyl and normally I would think you would only put the tongue and groove not out of the polystyrene behind it and the vinyl, I can't see why people want tongue and groove that they go to all those lengths would you? No Well I don't think so tongue and groove is, is wood innit? I don't know I mean I don't know nothing about these things, what, really have to feel that we are the lot Oh, and Us Girls, do we want that? Well we'll see what's right That's wro , right then, eight o'clock, eight thirty, that's half an hour innit, er we'll have to turn it off then, er leave out the news and then put Casualty that's half an hour, that's an hour yeah, we'll have to knock out, just knock out the news because otherwise you've got to back and that ain't you? Mm Seven thirty right, let's see what's on at six, the Crystal Maze or, eh? I think it's oh on, the next generation,John Ireland, Robert Fuller, Ben Cartright is dead Oh his brother arrives in Boston before he, miners who want the miners families' ranch that goes on till seven thirty Oh bloody hell well other than that we've got There's a fair bit on tonight mind, isn't there? Alright. What have I got to do here? I don't need all that. Right! Right, I'm ready. Now Rib two. Make one. Rib four. Yeah. Rib two. Do you want me to read it to you? Alright. Will it change then? Rib Yeah. two make one. Rib four one make one. Yeah? Where have you got to? Rib two, make one. Rib four, make one. Rib four. Yeah? Rib four. Make one. Yeah. Rib five. Yeah. Make one. Yeah. Rib four. Yeah. Make one. Mhm. Rib four. Mm. Make one. Mm. Rib five. And just there. Yeah? Make one. Yeah. Rib four. Mm. Make one, rib five. Sure, but on that, then we get the benefits of scale, and I think it's it's a well proven scheme, and I think the the evidence is there, that it is Thank you for that support, Jim. Right. If nobody else wants to make a contribution, do we agree that the report be accepted. Agreed. Agreed. Thank you. If I could just add my thanks to the officers substantial piece of work, which is, I hope going to be used by many members to come for the next year. Right. Can we move on to item eight. Annual Report on Equal Opportunities. Paper G. Jack. Yes, thank you, Chair, erm. About eighteen months ago, this committee reviewed and revised erm, it's Equal Opportunity Policy. And, accept a few requirements on officers which are identified in paragraph er, two of the report. So the report before you is the first real annual report on Equal Opportunities Inter County Council, so you've got all the relevant statistics and in that sense it compliments the previous report that you've just examined. And identifies target which have been pursued, or have been agreed, and are being pursued throughout the County Council. Appendix One of the report, sets out the position in relation to registered disabled employees of the County Council, July ninety-three, and you will see there in summary, that we've had a slight increase in the percentage of our employees, albeit that's got to be seen against erm, er er a lower total of employees altogether. It does indicate, nevertheless a step in the right direction. But one needs to add to it at least two relevant considerations. One is that that registered disabled employees and we will be bringing forward further proposals on initiatives to you at the next meeting, and I hope that if you agree, that will be amongst other things with the issue of non-registered disabled employees, and the other consideration in looking at movements in targets and so on, is inevitably the whole job market situation and the opportunities for achieving that. Appendix Two, er challenges a er genda profile. Erm, and I I would like to come on to that immediately if I may, but again it does indicate erm, a movement, in the right direction of getting more er women employees into higher management levels. A small movement, but nevertheless, a movement in the right direction. Erm, this report will be the subject of consultation with your employee representatives after you've received it. Erm, but, having been supported by each chief officer and general manager, you will see in paragraph eleven of the report, the various actions that have been taken over the last twelve months or so, and I would like to pick out particular the fact, that chief officers are now, operating or required to have effective arrangements for achieving equal opportunity in employment in their department or unit. The County Council as a whole, is now operating and using this new logo amber conditions, that go with it for the employment of the disabled. We are going to, we have star started a monitoring scheme for ethnic monitoring. A trial some people would say. And more particularly in Appendix Three, you've got for the first time, individual chief officers and general managers comments, for achieving a better equal opportunity profile in their department or unit. Erm, I I really don't want to add anything else, other than the summary, erm, that I gave you on Appendix One, Chairman, but if you move over to Appendix Two for a start, erm, this first of all, relates only to our A T T in and we hope in future to improve this sort of information in the other employee groups. Erm, members may well want to look at this, and spend a bit of time examining it. Could I just make a correction, which would help in that respect. On the total Okay, so twenty-nine to thirty-four throughout on all the relevant places. But I I I do suggest to you, that that about demonstrates what we've really known all along, it was subjectively, that County Council actually has more women employees than men. But actually, we need a lot more women employees, in terms of opportunity and advantage to them, at the senior management levels. As I've mentioned earlier, we've we've got a slight movement in the right direction. I hope that the targets that are before you in Appendix Three, demonstrate the way in which individuals and general managers do have, inevitably their targets vary because of the circumstances of their particular er unit or department. Erm, I'll try to answer any questions you may have on Appendix Three, bearing in mind all the detail there, involved. But I do suggest that if necessary, we can come back with answers later on. I do suggest that if you, with your relative responsibilities want to, you could take that up with the individual chief officer and general manager, and I just do need to draw your attention to the fact that the targets and the whole policy in education, does not apply in schools, because that is the responsibility of ind individual government bodies. So in that sense, your role is purely advisory. With that, Chair, I would recommend that you agree the, er, support you brought before you, which is as I said, will the subject of full consultation with your employee representatives. Thank you. Councillor and then Councillor Yes, when I looked through Appendix Three, the Equal Opportunities Targets, and the Public Service Units. When I saw Computer Services, I was immediately a bit disappointed. Er, to say nothing referring to the Registered Disabled and any positive er encouragement taken on. But I can reassure members that I've spoken to the department, and they are committed to attempt to encourage disabled applicants for jobs and taking them on. It's more of an omission on the paper, than an omission in a er, intent. Erm, they do, they are, they they have had er, registered disabled employees previously, er, and they are committed in in one ex example of two work experience er children from the St Francis Special School, they take two every year, er for for works experience training, and I do intend to talk to the General Manager and ensure that they are encouraging di disabled people to apply for jobs of that kind. Thank you. That's most helpful. Right, Councillor Well, thank you, Chairman. Er, first of all I would like to say, I'm all for Equal Opportunities. Erm, but I do believe who is the best person for the job. And then to apply for a job, I think should be on the complete basis of what what they are, what they've achieved, what they've done, regardless of whether they're male or female. Erm, there's a perfect example in Appendix Three, in and Planning It's the second page of of Appendix Three, and to read through it, and I won't read it, because obviously everybody has done. Every is going to be female, now does that mean to say, that if no males apply, or if you only advertise for someone female, which I presumably erm, actually going to er run the impossibly do it. only fe , only males apply they won't get Could I just I mean, I it's it's so it really does it does. When we are trying to get into equal opportunities and, as I say, I agree with you entirely, but I still think that the best person for the job I I I take, I I take that equal opportunities does raise peoples erm, blood pressure to say the least. I think that the points that I want to make here, because people come from different positions, is one, this is a long term strategy. Right, in ot other words, within four to eight years. Oay, so there could be So there could be a number of chartered engineer vacancies come up, during those four to eight years, but during the next four years, hopefully, we will be able to recruit one female chartered engineer. Now, the point about merit has to be recognised side by side with opportunities, because the points that I want to say, firstly the the many women and people with disabilities under achieve. Th they then very able to do jobs, but the lack of, for example, training and they don't get into those jobs, and secondly, we need to make an equal opportunities culture, very clear, so that women can come forward, and don't feel as though the they're going into a workforce that it to totally male dominated, which is quite off-putting. So it's about culture, training, opportunities and to make sure that people from whatever walk of life, and whatever gender or race or ability to have, or disability, do not under achieve. I mean, that's m my contribution as as a committed person to equal opportunities, but I'd welcome an example Well, if I may, Chair, I would like deal with it in terms of the principle or the policy and then the application to highways planning. You are right, and indeed, all of our advice, all the particular professional that Michael union gives to all of the the er, County Council matters, is that recruitment is on merit. It is unlawful, accept in two areas, to er discriminate in the way that you suggested, but essentially our our appointment process is on merit. It there are two exceptions, that I mentioned, we must give prior consideration in any vacancy that we have for a registered disabled applicant. I would like to see that for a disabled applicant, but nevertheless, for a registered disabled applicant, and we can make special provision for the training of er, under represented groups. And I I hope that when we bring our initiatives to you next month, you will see how we are addressing that. So in general terms, I agree with you, and that's the way it works with the exceptions I mentioned. Specifically in Highways and Planning, if you look at the previous report, the enclos following profile one, you will see that in the Highways Planning Department excepting the offices, it is almost entirely male, and I think this is, it's for the Director of Highways and Planning to say in the end, I think this is an acknowledgement by him that in the way that you mentioned nevertheless it seems to be apparent in some way, shape or form, women are not getting equal opportunity in that department. Chair, may I just come back on on one point. Mm. Thank you. I can appreciate all that, and I I appreciate the way in which females are being encouraged to apply for posts. But I I hope at the end of all this, there will still be how much training you've had, that when the post is eventually advertised it will still be And that is the situation. I I'm pretty sure that that's so, Chair, and you d when you say you're recruiting erm, young people from school, training or, erm, taking them on to engineering vacancies. You do have people from both sexes, of equal abilities and potential strengths, and it would be possible at that stage to have a training pool of people, which perhaps, er redress the balance, and perhaps er gradually have available many people, but you can only do that, if people come forward without skills that you need in order to train them into the jobs. Er, and that's one of the problems, is persuading good people to put their names forward for these jobs, and that's how you present it. Yep. Right. Yep. Councillor Yes, I think Councillor has just highlighted, is that there is a need for a change in the culture. I worked in a construction industry and er, and it was a male orientated dominated er industry, and I think what Councillor is probably just taking small parts in isolation,Highways and Planning which has at least one chartered engineer and additional female. You've then got to go below that and say, this was achieved through actual and it is the advertising making the public aware that we are prepared to employ females providing they're good enough. And this also has got to be encouraged through the schools, so that er, young er you know women, leaving school, going into career, will realise that they will be accepted into a previously male dominated industry. That's really what it's all about. You know, probably some of us are too old to accept this, but er, the younger people Burt, erm, will er the the younger people will be encouraged to start to accept this and it is a change in our thinking, that it, I find it difficult as well. But I'm certain, by doing it this way, we will encourage females to put in for these these posts. Even that our managers have got to be made by way of Councillor has said, will they be accepted on merit. I would ask, will the men be accepted on merit, and I would suggest that in the past, only a suggestion, but I'm very aware of it, that men were taken on and they weren't even as good as the women, so applied in the past, Can I just be clear, Councillor that you meant no disrespect to the Councillors at all. Erm, 'cos 'cos if you did, I'm sure that that wouldn't be popular in this committee. Under equal opportunities, they could both be the same age. Yeah, you don't want any Councillor Erm, yes, thank you, Chairman. It does seem to be on the whole a very encouraging report. I am pleased with the targets that each department's have achieved. Er,with regard to erm, disabilities. for a number of increase in employed. But I would like to say that this is very much, and I think Councillor knows that previous personnel committee, it's all in the mind, we want former administration and one of the latest tests was the adoption of the National Disability Symbol and encourage them to talk about it. Erm, I do understand that er, you know, we've got another report coming to us tomorrow on it, and there may be some additions on it disabled people hopefully about getting more people to,disabled people to That that's another aim we help people to I think other people want to speak, actually Oh, sorry,of course, I've forgot. I'd be delighted for your time. I mean, I I fully fully acknowledge that this Equal Opportunities Policy was initiated at a sub-committee on the ninth of October, ninety-two, so, you know, there isn't an argument on this occasion about previous conservative policies coming forward. Right. Councillor Erm, thank you, Mr Chairman. Erm, as you know, erm, we did have erm, Equal Opportunities erm, conference, erm, in erm, what came out of it was the fact that, although you could provide training, it was trying to get the confidence er, into the women to have the the nerve to apply for jobs. erm, and a lot of them training, but unless you can actually erm, increase their confidence, and that is the attitude of the people all over the place. So it's going to take a very long time, because it has been male orientated, but until we get the attitude of the work place, which is encouraging their piers to apply for jobs instead of, oh, of course , I don't think I will apply for that job. And and the women, are very difficult about apply for the jobs, so I think it's going to take an awful long time, erm, I'm all in favour of equal opportunities, erm, on all accounts, and I would agree with Councillor that one of the difficulties about registered dis disability is that, a lot of people who could actually be a registered disabled person, but for reasons of pride, don't want to be registered disabled. Erm, a lady could be, try and get the stigma away from that registration. Thank you. Thank you. I mean, I do I do take your point about the culture, and it and it's it is a significant issue, which will take some time, I mean, probably wi with your experience in Social Services you'll know that a substantial number of directors of Social Services are in fact female, and maybe one of the questions that we have to ask at a senior level is, our s senior erm, chief officers, erm, the fact that we've got no woman, chief officer, and it may well be because now that we've got an equal opportunities policy, that we may get applications from erm, very able women who see that we have got a clear commitment to equal opportunities demonstrated in this paper. Councillor Yeah, thank you, Chairman. I know the erm, remarks made about getting extra people to register and to have their green card, I'm probably one of a few councillors with a green card. But, I must say that, having got that, I do not regard myself as disabled, I have a disability, I do not regard myself as disabled, and it's this business that you have registered as disabled person, which is a bit of a stigma. I think perhaps, here though, it might be something, we have had a paper earlier about the J C C's meetings, and it might be something that unions might be able to help us with. Because sometimes, if the employer goes along, people will think, oh yes, they're only doing it to get their quota up, and they regard it as something that just helps us, and we can get nearer our quota, and it might be something that we could encourage the unions to help us with, because they could point out the positive benefits to people to be registered, despite the rotten name that they're called. Right, so that's a good point for the next J C C meeting. Right, Councillor Right, I I I don't want to repeat what's been said, in fact, I wouldn't like to speculate around the age of any member of the Right. what I would like to say is, that on the, er, er it is question of culture, it does take time, er, in my experience, I've been very interested in theological debate that's run with the ordination of women. In fact, we in methodism we've been ordaining women for the last twenty-five years, and it has become as natural as breathing to us. But it does take time, and I think, you know, this puts the, this gives the framework in which this can usually open the opportunities and the methodist women are not short of confidence, and I think that's why I married an anglican, you see. Right. Well, it it just gives a framework, with that relieve that problem. Right. Thank you, for that ecclesiastical contribution, Councillor Right, any anybody else wish to speak? Councillor Briefly, Chairman, yes, I I fully note that the County Council will encourage younger women, especially to come forward, er especially to higher grades as they are under represented er, I think there's hope in the future because college and universities are now more what were considered male dominated territory, more and more women are coming forward, and inevitably by sheer weight of numbers in the years to come they will be er, they will come forward, and I'm sure we will find on a say, chief officers for the County Council. Going back to hire and planning section, I bear that all in mind, I do fear that under hire and planning especially, when it says at least they're not at least that is verging on the possible discrimination, because as Councillor said, if no one, all all the best males forward, and they're all all better than the females, after four years, say, the erm, surely the highest paid, the temptation is going to be say, that er, for example , that er inferior female employee instead of a inferior female to a male. Erm, I think that sums it up. When you've coped with a positive situation, which is in fact, I believe is is er, will do more harm that good, as a personal I believe, Well, two things, I can assure you that married women will remain the one of the most issue on selection. Positive action rather than positive discrimination is the approach, and that, these are targets not erm, contracts, and if after four to eight years, it may well be the case that women have been taken on and have left and at the end of the time, that there there is no woman chartered engineer. But there are targets, and and I think targets are important in order to shape a culture. Right. If nobody else wants to speak, erm, Councillor you're to deliver the recommendation. Thank you. recommendations one and two. Right. Thanks, that's Paper G. If we could move on to Paper H. Trade Union Recognition. Jack. Yes, Chair, if I may, it'll be relatively quick. We brought a a report to you, er, last time, in relation to Trade Union Recognition in the er B sector, giving up most of our erm, employees have now gone to the independent colleges. We undertook to, you sorry, you authorised us to de-recognise the three unions that were recognised in that field, if the unions agreed, I have to report that two of them have, and the other one naturally, discussions are still going on. We will report further as necessary. Any comments? No Is it agreed with a recommendation. Agreed. Agreed. Thank you. Paper I. Agenda Item Ten. Local Government Reorganisation. Staff Commission Report. Thank you, Chair. I'm not sure to what extent we in Lincolnshire will have to take the Local Government Staff Commission seriously. I'm not at all sure that er, Monday's announcement will er, make it any clearer, but we will see. It is, however, right and proper that we do report to this sub- committee on the activities of the staff commission, and that I do in the paper before you. In paragraphs two onwards, I give the names of the local governments staff commission, erm, what their statutory it is, and can I just point out at the bottom of the page, paragraph five, please remember that the staff commission is advisory and it has in itself no mandatory powers. It may recommend to the government and the government makes its powers, but in itself, it cannot er make any mandatory arrangements. It can merely advise. Paragraph six, detailed what the Secretary of State of the Environment is asking the staff commission to advise him on, and paragraph seven, gives some details of a circular which the staff commission has already put put out, which for the moment at least, really more applies to other authorities such as Cleveland, who are now, or the Isle of Wight, who are now in to this particular situation. Staff commission has issued a number of consulta or has issued a consultation paper, and I detail that in paragraph eight, and in our response to that, basically, we have said the nineteen seventy-four arrangements for the staff commission seemed to have worked very well, and we hope the staff commission will, the new staff commission will stick very closely to that, and only vary them when they've got a perfectly good reason for doing so. In paragraph nine, I report that erm, members of this council including the Chair of this committee, Vice Chair Committee Councillor met with this local government staff commission here in these offices. Erm, we have a very useful meeting. We direct our, directed our input in our meeting on two erm, strands. Firstly, erm, issues of principle, and I I've outlined those in item nine one six, and then acquainted them with the Lincolnshire situation, special things that we thought applied in Lincolnshire, that they ought to be aware of. Clearly, for example, how er, employee prime card, including for example , the erm, P S U arrangements that we have here, which is perhaps not common to other parts of the country and so forth . And we made all these points clear to them, we also very much drew their drew their attention to making sure that any rules or advice they gave, did actually work out in an equal opportunity way. There's some danger that you can erm design rules, without understanding what the effect of those would be, on perhaps women employees of local authorities. We drew all those to their attention. Some of it was clearly new to them, and er, they made the right responses. In addition, I agree and I have now done so, supplied them with further information about this county's employee profile, and that's sir, is where the matter now rests. Thank you, anybody want to ask any questions on local contribution. Not really. Sorry I was just commenting er, you know, we just want to work in the County of Lincolnshire, I presume. That's right. I mean, there there are two issues. The first is, where is Lincoln going, Lincolnshire going to left after the local erm, government commission put their proposals forward and the government have a look at them, and then secondly, what our, as we note from Item Eleven, a fuller report will be brought to this sub-committee when the local government staff commission or the Secretary of State to give us definitive advice. So we're waiting on two fronts in a sense. Anything else. Just, just to comment on Councillor Er, one thing I think we highlighted after the meeting with the they're sort of working awareness of the setup in Lincolnshire, if you look at the er, structure of the er, commission, one from personnel,chief executives They did seem to have er, very little knowledge of a rural shire county. And if you look at, er in para six, arrangements for staff transfers,you couldn't find staff transferring en bloc. They didn't realise the implications of that in Lincolnshire was regrettable centralised in a system operating out of Lincoln. You know, on er, sort of long process over a number of years. If er there was the in Lincolnshire, try and transfer those, you know, en bloc it's just not on. And especially with the age group higher er, and again not being disrespectful to anyone, it is, is a lot, the average age is much higher in some of these administrative posts. In other words, people have settled into an environment where they live, and to even attempt to get to talk and get themselves out. You six off to Boston, you six are go round to you know, just stamp them, you know Lincoln. And, anyway, we did put them in the picture, they left much more knowledgeable than when they came. That that,I mean, the er, guy from er Doncaster was referring to his experiences in nineteen seventy- four, wasn't he?urban area, which is completely different to Lincolnshire. And it worried me that these are the sort of people that would have been advised into the committee. If our officer had not sent them away with lots of facts and information. The fact that they do that Which I've now supplied. That's the whole Yes. Only one significant point is that the County Council's workforce that has more than twenty per cent of staff over fifty years of age, which is quite unusual compared to other local authorities, and it has quite serious implications for the pension fund, Mm. in terms of paying out any enhancements if people take early voluntary retirement, or are made, erm, if a package is with, at at at the time of government reorganisation. So that's quite a significant erm, issue that we've brought to their attention. Right. Do we agree that the report should be noted. Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. Thank you. Can then we then move to Paper J. Local Government Superannuation Scheme. There's two parts to it. The efficiency scrutiny and the compensation regulations, and Jack's going to deal with both of them. Thank you. If I may I'll tackle the second one first, and that is to say the proposed er alteration to the compensation regulations. I think it's wise for the local government superannuation scheme. Erm, we were consulted by the A C C as it were, between committees and had to respond on proposals for giving individual local authorities wider discretions in paying compensation to their employees, erm, the issue here actually summarised quite well in the digest that you already looked at Paper C. The relevant which, at one of which was that the A C C sought powers for local authorities to have a discretione a discretion to award up to an extra, up to fifty two weeks pay in addition to existing statutory requirements. The proposals Department of the Environment are actually for sixty- six weeks, but including existing statutory requirements, which can be as much as thirty weeks for the long serving employee. therefore we have supported the A C C line on the basis of the flexibility that it would give you, as an employer, bearing in mind, you don't have to do anything, it will be your choice in the individual case, er, within your policies. We've, as I say, we've supported that. Since then, there's also been erm, consultation as to whether that principle, or rather those extensions should be implied =plied to your other pensionable employee groups, i.e. teachers and firemen. The consultation at present is on teachers and the Department for Education's view is, that those regulations should not be extended to teachers, but the support of the Director of Education, County Fire Officer and County Treasurer we have erm, suggested that any change to the local government superannuation scheme should be extended to those other groups, because quite frankly you can't complicate different arrangements if you simple take the score. But if you like, governments could do this for the non-teaching staff and not do that for the teaching staff. So I hope that you will agree or confirm the action that we've taken in expressing those sorts of views. One more thing, if I may, we've just been told of the government's first response to the consultation arrangements, sorry, wrong wrong item, it's all right. Stop. Right. It's an answer, it's on item two. Fine. Contributions on Item Two before we move on to Item One. As logic demands Right, Okay, can we go then, to Item One. Yes, Chair, as as as as some management will probably know, erm, the Department for Environment has had an efficiency scrutiny report, on the local government superannuation scheme, and the finance sub-committee er agree County Treasurer's proposals for comment on that, as it were, since the recommendations of the Scrutiny Report are set out there in paragraph one three of the report before. The three main headings, and I'd like to concentrate on the de-regulation and the flexibility points rather than administration of this . Erm, it was not possible to get your views in, as it were, personnel terms rather than financial terms on that er report, but er as it were on your behalf, we supported the Treasurer's er recommendation for reasons set out in paragraph one four, and if I can er explain that for you a little little more, de-regulation could mean, that each employing authority has it's own scheme of superannuation, or not, and if not would simply leave employees in a position of taking them off the state scheme S E R P S or going for a personal pension. Clearly, apart from the financial arguments, in terms of employment policies, if that is the case, erm, then, employees who are present see their pay, their total pay or reward package, has included the benefits of the local government evaluation scheme, will say, well you take that away, or you'd better start doing something about our pay arrangements in recompense. And that itself, takes you into inevitably, the cost side of that, and clearly against that background there are potential industrial relations implications, if those proposals go forward. I hope that on that basis, first of all, that you agree with the views that we expressed in anticipation of your view, and secondly, erm, that we really do need to look at through you, these sort of aspects of pension management on behalf of the County Council. Don't want to interfere at all in the business of the administration of the scheme, the investment side of it, but there are clearly, discretionary areas in the superannuation regulations, which effect significantly your pay, employment and reward policies. Hope you agree with that, er Chair, all of the recognised unions were informed of the County Council's approach in early decision, and supported it entirely. Sorry, and it is this one that we just got an update on. Erm, and if if I can just, we will Treasurer and ourselves, be reporting to you in more detail on this, in the appropriate areas, but suffice it to say, that the government are accepting the need for further investigation on some of these issues, to look at some of them in the light of the national B U D report, on superannuation and pension arrangements generally, have nevertheless agreed that individual authorities ought to have some more discretion, and the compensation regulations that I mentioned earlier, is one example of that. Thank you. I mean, it does seem to appropriate to say, that the both the personnel sub-committee and investment sub-committee are inter-related committees with common agendas. Quite simply, personnel policies that we set can have major impacts on erm, the funding of our superannuation scheme, and I think that at some stage in the future, it may be appropriate to think about a seminar for both of those committee members, to look at both the the good report and the the Department of Environment scrutiny, erm So. Anybody want to make a contribution. Councillor Yes, just a point of definition, really. I I I just wondered with the so-called if staff members independent advice, erm, on what is best for them to do with superannuation pension scheme. Normally, we'd have yeah, normally we'd have Roy here. But he's in hospital, I believe, at the moment. Who wants to take But but but the answer is that, I'm not sure of officers, but it's something like County Treasurer, one of the existing County Treasurers and the Superannuation Manager, Roy are registered as independent advisers. I think they may be rethinking that, and maybe bringing proposals back to you, but that's the crunch. Councillor I totally agree that there is er I think, probably a need for seminar, you know,it's an area, it's er, it's changing, you know, all the time. Erm, we all know the problems that some people have got into by opting out. Yes. Yes. and that er, you know, has lead to a lot of misery in some cases, er, also I mean there's question of viability of our own scheme and I er, think er you know, er there are a number of questions which I as a lay-man would like to be, you know, I think the seminar is probably the right to do that. I would er, if It depends on timing, because I'm not sure when government reports are coming out. Anyone excuse me. Right. Do we agree the recommendations, then. Agree. Thank you. Right. A trip into Europe. Item Twelve, Paper K, European Community Recent Development. Thank you. The committee has asked from time to time, that I keep it updated with er European legislation, in so far as it affects employments matters, and this I've intended to do in Paper K. There are two Appendix. Appendices. Appendix A reports a European Councillor of Directive, ninety-three stroke one-oh-four stroke E C. Which erm, is being challenged, or would like to be challenged by the U K including European Court of Justice erm, and that will be heard in the timescale that these things take place. If it were to be erm, not annulled is it likely that the directive would affected from something like ninety, late nineteen-ninety-six. Paragraph four gives you this summary of the main provisions of this directive, and there they are, for your consideration or observation. Appendix B is rather one earlier in the process where the European Community have produced a green paper, on European Social Policy, which will have impact upon employment legislation later on in the process. This green paper is capable of being commented on, by this sub-committee through, our normal channel would be the A C C. It doesn't contain a lot of detail, it is a matter of principle, and er, hopes and aspirations. Where we think and I mentioned this in the conclusion, and indeed, in the recommendation, where we think as officers it rather falls short, is that, although it does mention in the text, equal opportunities in all our er, activities as we would understand it here. It fails to put forward any options for accept for erm, equal rights, for disability or race, and we think this is an omission, and if it were your intention to write a response, we would want to include that point in the response we make. Thank you, Chris. Can we look at Appendix A, first. The recommendation is simply that it be noted and I wondered if anybody wanted to make a contribution, or ask any questions, put anything forward, on Appendix A. Councillor Yes, thank you, Chairman. I would, I would hope that as erm, as a committee we can support all these objectives, er, it does give me some cause for concern, that our own government is objecting to these provisions. Erm, just to comment on, for example, maximum average erm, hourly week, forty-eight hours. Erm, only the other day in the Transportation Department we were talking about drivers hours and er, it's obvious implication there on road safety where the government are trying to relax the provisions, for what's the European committee are trying to tighten them up. And er, we see on the media, very often, the problems faced by doctors in hospitals working eighty hours. Once again a proper scandalous situation, that we we should be working to er relieve, but doesn't seem to be the way that the government's moving. I hope we can support this one. Thank you. Councillor Er, yes, Mr Chairman. It night-shift not to exceed eight hours. Quite a number of people on of twelve. Er, how's it going to affect them, they're quite happy to do it, and er. There won't be a deregulation, of course. Hang on, Jim,Ji Ji , I'll write your name down, all right. Right, hang on, right. Carry on. you see people of priority, that deliver employment, Mr Chairman. Whether they go on late at night, or, hair cut the next morning, it's not, it's not to the wall, but er, this would appear to cut right across the board. That they aren't going to be allowed to do that. Which means some changing at night, or doing a bit with the night, or other one. Right. How, how, how does that fit in to Right. That's that's part of, of presumably, one of the objections from the U K Government, erm, that essentially, it's saying that that these arguments can't be, justified on health and safety grounds and that that the approach, de-regulation and freedom in the market to al allow people to do what they want to do, which is the fact that they, if they want to work twelve hours, then presumably the Government and yourself are supporting that that freedom. On the other hand, one can argue that it's not about, necessarily, what individuals want to do, it's about providing a framework that is good in health and safety terms. Well, well, this this is what I'm getting at, Mr Chairman, Mr Chairman. Er quite a few, I know, in security work, they prepared to go on not later than eight o'clock at night. So they can stay on normally, in some part of the year it is dark, but yet there's other people around and about, and they get in situ before very late, so the twelve and twelve suits them, and it's better for health and safety, and erm, in other , Mr Chairman. Regulation tends, is intending Is what they want to do. Regulation is intended to protect everybody's interest. Councillor erm, I'm glad you said that, Chairman,I was I was just thinking erm, cut out the but, regarding on Equal Opportunities, erm, Policies, as we've been discussing already, I would have thought housewives would have been delighted to have conservative hours rest presumably I just thought I was The right contribution helps our meetings. Councillor Er, thank you, Chairman. Well, I give a vote that erm, because certainly not everybody's aware that er, this er Service director is merely a way to get round to payments that different people have opt out of the social chapter. Well, what people forget is that, if you put employers in a straight-jacket, the people who suffer first, are the employees, which as you appreciate will not take on the future. One of the reasons why er Kenneth has a respectable crippling this country, is because there is more flexibility over there to this country. advice is taking people off, with, in the knowledge that they will not necessarily, er, er, er put themselves in a straight-jacket. Er, we keep meaning look at certain things report a eight hour week, including overtime, have a record period of four months and then the filing industry take it away, the work is seasonal. That's the of con of considerable concern, and it will mean possibly that faith er farm workers who rely on overtime to increase it's wages will will suffer as a result. So I do hope er that we that we do not support this, er, we've got to remember, it's not, Europe, is not the end all and be all of the world, there is a there is a Far East out there, there's the Japans of the world, the Koreans. Their employee costs are much lower than ours, their social costs are much lower than ours and in and in the real world, we have to compete with them, and the boiling point will come from being competitive, supplying goods and services at a cost that the other countries will not by putting themselves in straight-jackets. Thanks. Councillor Oh yes, I've come to er just ask the advice on the officers on the Appendix A Six er, negotiations., i.e. flexibility clauses for certain circumstances, for certain mistakes. flexibility er in implementation, and I think that that is the necessary part of it. But what, I think we do need to have is quite a a a a a we've not a no solution body who would agree with me, er you know, some of the things that have gone on within the er er agricultural industry in terms of gang masters, which is if if surely if if if we had been more clearly defined if would enforce probably the whole industry into disrepute, and I feel that we do need a a a a a a a framework, with a with a supply into Europe, because in the end we will not just be competing against other European countries we will be competing against the third world and some producers that are producing very different situations, so, I I think er, and and I'm concerned that it is the, it is that delegation, and it is the interpretation that our own government will put on it, because there's been so much mythology surrounding Europe. I went to the er conference that we had at Stokewatchford, which together with er, John, er my Vice Chairman er on Europe, the other week, and there is so much mythology, er, that has been dispensed by people who are half-hearted towards Europe or got a vested interest in no has not been committed to Europe, and and they use this, and in fact the classic example was, that, one of our own Lincolnshire M P's claimed that he had saved , Lincolnshire's from the ravages of Europe. absolute nonsense and he took an accolade for that, when in fact, it was never under any threat from European legislation, it was our own British Food Act, and that, our own interpretation of European war, that has brought the threat to us. So I think that there's, I welcome, you know, the Social Chapter on that basis, but it does clearly say, and prescribe, er something that can only be universally applied, and if there are, there is need, there is need, er there is scope for that, with delegation through particular industries, particular circumstances. Thank you,thank you. Councillor and then Councillor and then we can take the recommendation. First of all, Councillor comments,erm, you know, there seems to be this this er conservative mentality, that is let's drive all our working conditions down to the level of the competition, which means, you know, we would have a a mining industry if we were prepared to put children in, like that do in Columbia. Now, now I, now I, personal arguments has always been that we raise people's standards, out there, throughout the world. Not not, bring people down to the worst conditions that we can find in the world to be competitive. This is, it it's not the attitude that we need to be taking, and there's no where else we'd be supporting in, in in this, er, opposition to this particular European Council of Directive. It, I mean, it disappoints me that we are the country in Europe that that's always dragged, kicking and screaming to the table, to discuss things like this, which are the benefit of the majority of the people in the in the European Community. It's just those few, committed capitalists that see profits as the only, the only motive to be on this earth, that seem to be, was was they seem to have the influence in this in this country, and and like er, I'm I'm hoping that this er, er British Government objection to the Court of Justice does fail, as as is er suggested it may do, erm, and let's let's hope it does, and let's hope that we get this er, implemented. Thank you, thank you. Councillor Yes, er thank you Chair. I can't see anyone can disagree with the objection Oh you can, I mean, we've just heard some. Yes, well probably, it's time for me to try and change his mind. Er, because er, we, do we want the rest of the world to follow us, not for us to follow the rest of the world. And he mentioned about both competing with China and er er the Third World Countries. Very recently, not so long ago, I saw on programme on India, in in one of the sweat-shops, you saw young children, boys and girls about twelve years old, on their hands and knees making matches, and a man walking down the centre with a stick. That was, that's the reality of cheap imports from the Third World. Now, the er, whilst we cannot expect them to adopt say our ideals, because we are er, you know, we're probably more modernised in lots of ways, but we can set a standard which they work towards, and er, he mentioned about the fact that people er, the unemployment's coming down a lot with the jobs, they're just part-time jobs, and they're very cheap paid jobs, and very er bad conditions for a lot of people as far as health and safety goes. Because we mustn't miss the point, it does say, it's er, the government is objecting be on the grounds of health and safety. Now this is leading towards that, to make people work too long, especially part-time jobs, come from one to another. They could be very tired, we've seen er, er the consequences of that and er, a lot of er these accidents happening on er, with the coaches and one thing and another. Because people have done one job, during the day, and then having to go on to another job at night, and make no mistake, that, you know, this is the sort of legislation that we need, to protect us, the public from what, you know, the consequences of somebody working Tape number three in conversation with Mr John . You were mentioning the the old coffin route from . Starting at , you said. Starting at a hundred and ninety. On the one inch, map. Hundred and ninety. Up by that loch. Now that's near Loch . That's it. Watch me now. Ah can you mark it in maybe? That's it. I see, up to the Glen . That's right, but it doesn't go as far as the Glen , Right. it keeps this side of the Glen , To the side. And then in like that. Mhm. Follow me? Yes. I'll just have a shot at pencilling that in. Yes it's a very Its near it anyway. a windy track. It's a, oh yes a windy track. Not the easiest ways. The people who undertook such a It's more or less the hard ground. Aha, the ground very much ? And there was and there was cairns where they used to rest the the coffin, cairns here and there along the route. Was there? Where they used to rest the the coffin for a m m and have a dram and a piece of cheese or some biscuits. I'd read about, I read erm read in erm some paper or other not so very long ago, about erm a funeral and the that was going along the road of course,and they came to a to a erm hotel and they were och, they were going for miles and miles and miles and they went into this hotel and the they party the funeral party went into the hotel and had a good few drinks and they were well away when they came out and they they they went away without the coffin, for two miles, two miles before they discovered that they didn't have the coffin. They had to go back ag go back again for the coffin. The people who undertook er following that route, through such a an entanglement of lochans and turns, would have had to have know their directions very well otherwise Yeah. they could have been lost quite easily. And do you know think that these cairns possibly were there to guide them as mu as much as anything? Oh well they they knew the road, these men knew knew the road very well, and er they knew the Area. area, they could tell by the hills, they could tell the way. I came from m my from , across the hill with my father when I was sixteen, at night. At night? At night. But it was a lovely moonlit night and we didn't leave , it was about eight o'clock at night when we left . We were at at there, and I went with er with my father er on a Friday and we came back that night. Now that must be a good, what would you say, seven miles at least in one direction? Well it it would be something like that,so something like At least. seven miles. Easily. And Well it would, it was two good hours, to walk across the erm . Take you two hours anyway. That was well it's wasn't quite a mile and a quarter. And this was just a beaten track? Oh just a beaten track. Whereas the other one in Glen was an actual made track? Well I'll tell you a good story about that, to s , to let you see that it was a well beaten track. And it was just the the the people were often walking along this track, anyway there was a man,there was erm,was a, there was a man and a woman walked over to and walked back again at night, well in the the even , evening anyway. And the woman lost her brooch on the way back and she saw this man next morning, he was a policeman in , and he he was too fond of the drink,a and he he was on, he was a railway policeman, and he fell onto the rails, when the train was coming, nobody knows how he how he how he er he lost one arm er about there and the other one about there, both arms but he he survived it. Nobody knows how he he how the how his head wasn't bashed. But anyway this woman that lost the brooch, she me she saw this man, without the hands going across the hill to , she asked him where he was going, and he said, I'm going to to , across the hill. Are you coming? No, she said, I've been there yesterday, but er I lost a brooch, and I wish you would be on the look out for it. Did you keep the track all the way? he said. Yes, all the way. Anyway this man without the arms, he went to and he had er he had er a pocket outside his jacket here, and he he erm got the brooch and he called on the at the house where this woman was and he says, Put your hand into that pocket, he said, and she puts her hand in, Oh, she say, she says, You've got the brooch. Yeah, yeah, he says, I think that'll be yours. But how did the, what was puzzling a lot of people how did he manage to get it off the ground and into his pocket. By his teeth? He must he must erm stooped down on his knees and caught it in his mouth and and got it into his pocket some way or another. Mm, but both these people came from ? Yes, both of them. And that's a, an incredible tale. It is, right enough . Because it it really bears out what you were saying that the there was a track which Well it it erm, it shows you that there was a track. Because no one could have found that brooch if it Bootlegging, yes. Bootlegging. Do you know bootlegging as well there's another one, you see the tapes in machines, yeah? Someone will take where is it? There isn't one in there. Someone will take a microphone to a concert and you'll hear, say a band, any band you wanna think of, say what er who shall we say? Genesis. Take That. Take That, we'll say Take That, a man sits he takes a tape in and he records the whole concert. He then got it there, he then takes that tape and plays another tape he makes a? Records it all. Bootleg. He makes a bootleg. Right. It doesn't come out very well though all the time. No it doesn't come out all the time very well. Why are you an expert on mm mm mm? No. All you've gotta do is Right it's a bootleg it's a bootleg, that's it, it's a good word, bootleg. But it, but that would be a fraud because you're, you're Yeah? That'd be a fraud, a kind of fraud, yeah? Great word. Anything else you've learnt in th on your course? Bootlegging was a long time ago when er the people wasn't allowed to Bootlegging's still happening now, it still goes on now, and it still causes the music industry lots to lose, lots and lots of money, lots and lots of money. Any other questions? Any other questions, come on think about it? What were the children doing in the programme? Investigating Oh yeah they were investigating Investigating. That's what police officers do, they investigate crimes, they investigate crimes. The federals. What's known as the uniform branch turn up to investigate a crime, I hope you're all listening Yeah, the uni er the uniform branch turn up to investigate a crime and if they find fingerprints they will get what's known as a scenes of crime officer to take the fingerprints off the wall, yeah? But they'll also get the C I D, they'll get a detective to come along and help investigate the crime, so we investigate the crimes like you did on your computer course, yeah? We do our own investigations, yeah? Happy with that? Mm. Erm on this film I saw when they was getting the fingerprints they had this sort of like little cloth in a bag and they sort of That's right, yes. Because e if you all look at your fingerprints now, you're looking at, no one else in the world has got fingerprints like you've got. They are all individual, no one 's got the same fingerprints that you've got. They're not the same, can you see there's little circles, little whirls, little loops, little arches No. yeah? You have a look, everything is different. No one in the world has got fingerprints like you've got because we are all different. Right? Right I think we'll have working now cos I'm drying up quickly. First word, use a good, a good police word. I know. Gun. Shh. Gun, yeah. Court. Court, well done. Handcuffs. Handcuffs. Prison. Prison. Pardon? Drinking? Drink driving, that's good enough. Arson. Arson. Jail. Jail. Keys. Keys. Fingerprints. Fingerprints. What did I call that person who comes what did I call it? Shh! Something I can't remember Can't remember? Alright then. Crikey. Speak up loud, you've gotta be speak up loud and clear. No. Uniform. Uniform. Uniform. Detective. Detective, well done. Crime. Crime, well done. Copyright infringement. Copyright infringement. Bars. Bars. F I B. F I B? F B I. F B I. walkie talkie. Sierra oscar? That's a call sign, sierra oscar, what does, okay then, sierra oscar, what does it stand for? I dunno, a car. What is it , a car, yeah, but why? What are they using when they call that out? Sierra oscar C erm to Mayday. Shh shh shh shh. No no no it's a special, it's a special I know! it's a special language yeah? Right what's your name? Craig. Craig? Craig, your name is charlie romeo alpha india golf. No I'm not. What is your second name? , well how do you spell it? Hold on,that is charlie oscar november yankee alpha romeo delta. That's, that's the alphabet you're using, and you're using, you said sierra oscar. So that, what they're saying is sierra stands for S, oscar stands for O. It's a way of remembering complicated a way of remembering index numbers, your name, because if someone goes to you S O it's quite easy to forget it, but if someone said sierra oscar, an hour later you'd go what was that? what was that? I can't remem oh sierra oscar, I've remembered. It's a way of re making things I knew it cos I've watched The Bill. Well yeah, exactly. Next question? D I, D C I D C I, yeah I'll give you that one, detective chief inspector, ooh and who do you know who's a detective chief inspector? Assault. Ass assault, well done. Arrest. Arrest, well done, good word. Offices. Offices, yeah, we all need offices. Murder. Murder, good word. Bootlegging. Bootlegging, well done, we've all gone round I haven't Oh! Go on, a word from you. jacket. Jasper Carrott, he's supposed to Shh shh. fingerprints did they? Fingerprints, yeah. They're not walkie talkies, they're a radio. We've got two kinds of radio, we have one radio we carry ourselves Yeah. which is for local and one in the car which is county wide, which can cover the whole of Essex, yeah? Not on them little boxes. Not on them little ones, no, you have to have special adaptors to make those little ones go everywhere. Yes? Hold on a second shh. If you, if you arrest someone for murder would you say suspicion of first degree murder? No. Right that's, that's, you see you're getting the American stuff but when you're arrested you are always arrested on suspicion because in this country you are innocent until a cou a court proves you're i er guilty, yeah? I can't arrest you and say guilty cos you have to go to court, so you would always be arrested on suspicion of murder. Cos if you went to court and you was innocent and you got off, that's it. The police only enforce the law, they can't make the law work, the people who make the law work are the judiciary. I said, did I say that right? Judiciary, yeah, big word of the day, judiciary. You are always arrested on suspicion, a suspicion of something, yeah? And someone will say I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder Erm if you see the murder happen can you say erm that you are guilty? No. I can give evidence that I s right for, say, we'll go back to his, his er idea, suspicion of murder, I can say I saw him take a hammer and whack him, split his head open, he dropped down dead. I could give evidence on that, yeah? But I still can't make him guilty. Only a judge and a jury can make him guilty. That's why police officers have to go to magistrate's courts, and crown courts, to give evidence. But it is the magistrate or, or a er a crown court judge and jury who make him guilty. I can only give evidence and if they don't believe my evidence, he's innocent. If they believe mine evidence, he's guilty. Yeah? What? Erm in America I think it is erm they carry them black th they're black erm things Poles. they carry around w they carry around with them. Truncheon. Like a truncheon? Yeah. Right they're called a pacifier. They're, they're like a long stick with a handle on them aren't they? Yeah. There is an i there is an idea afoot to bring them to this country, to let policemen, cos the policeman's truncheon is only short use them someone has to be close but these pacifiers can be a offensive weapon and a defensive weapon. Yeah? But that's gonna take about five or six years to come to frui fruition because all the er chief constables are talking about it and if anything works slowly it's chief constables. They're called a pacifier and you can sort of like use them to strike and to defend yourself with them yeah? Are you allowed to use bulletproof jackets. Are you allowed to use bulletproof jackets, yes. I wouldn't use a bulletproof, well in certain circumstances I might, but I'm not trained to carry a firearm so I wouldn't use a I, hopefully, I won't get selected to go into a house where I need to wear a bulletproof uniform. You have to go on special courses to carry guns What the army? in this No it's a special, it's a different tactic. In the army they fire bullets and they have their big powerful bullets and the idea is that the bullet comes through her, travels across, goes through her and goes into him so there's one, two, three casualties so it will take four people to carry her, four people to carry her, four people to carry him, that is sixteen, that is, altogether, twelve plus three, fifteen people we've taken out of the battle, yeah? Whereas a police bullets they wanna hit her and stay in here. Because what's the point of hitting her, coming through her, travelling half a mile You might hit another and kill a innocent person. And we don't want that to happen, and we have different kinds of bullets that hit her and stay there. Oh like them er put out ones what, like the darts? Totally different. Totally different. We just want it to stay there, different calibre, different power and different altogether. We don't, we just want the guilty person shot, we don't want the guilty person shot, come out hit the innocent person. Yeah? Cos we would be in trouble. Yeah? Agree? Have they just got Colt revolvers? Well you're watching the Americans again. You've been watching the Americans, they, cos the Americans, why do American police officers carry guns? Self defence. No. Self defence, but there is something important that allows American police officers to carry their guns It's not crime, it's got nothing to do with crime, it's got nothing to do with cowboys and indians it's got nothing to do with self defence. Cos you can, cos er other people can buy guns in America. He has his moments. Yeah! He has his moments doesn't he? Yes there is something ticking away in there. Right. Under the c under the constitution of America, big word, constitution of America, it is written into the constitution of America all, I think it goes, all militia men militia men and men can bear arms for their country which basically reads they can defend their country, they can have a gun in their house to defend their country. But what it meant is it got read, written into the constitution, it meant that everyone can buy a gun. So if everyone's got a gun What even a ten year old kid? Well we've, think about it, common sense. The policeman's gotta carry the gun because if everyone else in the country has a gun, the policeman needs a gun. Yeah? Makes sense. Because it's written into the constitution that all men can bear arms to defend the country. So everyone goes out, buys a gun and when a policeman says why have you got that gun? Er if there's a war I'm gonna defend my country with that gun. It's a load of rubbish but everyone does it, everyone carries a gun. But there was, but each state has different legislation, yeah? Each state has, in some states you can be eighteen and carry a gun but in another state you've gotta be twenty one, they make all different laws. That's why it's very very hard to get rid of the guns in America, cos there's so many about. Yeah? Do they just carry hand guns? They can carry hand guns, they can carry rifles they can Machine guns. Machine guns cos Think about it. Be, use common sense, you're not er you're not that daft to say bazookas. Yeah? And who, who has seen certain films where someone just walks into it, shows his driving licence and he buys a gun, yeah? No, I've seen Terminator, he does. I knew he was gonna say I knew you was gonna get Terminator in the convers , he said it out there didn't he? Sooner or later he's gonna get Terminator in the conversation. Yeah. Shh shh. Shh shh. Yes okay then use, use a bad, use a bad example, yes did you see Terminator when Arnold Schwarzeneger walks into the shop , yeah? Did you see him bullet out and k kills a man. Yeah, he, he it was literally b literally like going up to the shop and buying a newspaper. All he has to do is show he's over a certain age can prove who he is, you can buy a gun. It is that easy. You just buy a machine gun. That is the reason, that is why, the reason why all police officers in America carry guns. It's not that they need them, it's because they know everyone else has got them. Yeah? They need And here's, here's, hold on a minute here's, here's something else here's a statistic, in America in America, when a policeman, every time a policeman fires his gun and I'm not talking about one or two I'm talking everyone, it's a statistic, you all know what statistics is I hope? Statistics. Every time a policeman in America, every four times a policeman in America, that could be a policeman in New York, a policeman in Los Angeles, a policeman in Boston and a policeman in Seattle yeah? Or Chicago. Within Well whatever, yeah. Right? Shh. Of those four usually shoots the person they er the person they shoot, yeah? The person they're after shooting. The other Punch him. You say that you say that but can I punch you? Yeah. Hold on a second here's one, can I punch you? Think about it,com are you with us? Cooee! Are you with can I punch you, can I punch you? No. Can I punch Miss? Yeah. Yeah. I can punch Miss can I? Shh shh shh think about it. Hold on, no no no, calm down. Think about it. Need to get through me first. Eh? Can I do it? Think about it, it's a game we're playing, think about it. Yeah? Can I go up and punch Miss? Yeah. No. Yes. Yes. No. Who says yes? Who says yes? Who says no? You're both right and you're both wrong. Because, because she's done nothing. Shh shh. Keep going, keep going, you're a his moments doesn't he? He does have moments. Shh. She's done nothing, she's done nothing to hurt you. Keep going. some reason. Keep, shh shh shh, keep going. She's not guilty. You're, you're on the right lines, you're on the right lines. She has done? Nothing Nothing wrong. Yeah. Right, if she's done nothing wrong if er if she's done nothing Shh Can you answer this question? Oh right. Right. If she's done nothing wrong, right? And I walk up and punch her what, what, what have I done, think about it, what have I done? Think about it. Assault. Think about it. Without shouting out, you're right, I've assaulted her. Was that assault on her justified? She's done, she's though? Shh shh, she's done nothing, she's done nothing wrong and I've assaulted her was the assault justified? She's done nothing wrong. No. She Is it justified? No. Right. Fair enough. I, when I ass when a policeman assaults someone it has got to be justified. Yes, right then, same thing Miss comes at me with a knife and she attempts to stab me and she means it, she wants to stab me and she means it So you can Shh shh shh. I then defend myself and assault Miss, I assault Miss, yeah? She's trying her hardest to stab me, and I assault her. Is the assault justified? Yes. Who agrees with him? Yes. Me. You're right, yeah, it has to be justified. If I just walk across, you're sitting there, and just kick someone is it justified? No. I've got no right to do it, I break the law like anyone else. Yeah? I break the law like anyone else. You can be put in jail. I can be put in jail, yeah. Exactly the same. When I assault someone it has to be justified. Yeah? Pardon? Right. Let's go one rou round again, we've had enough words, we'll go the other way good police word, go Police dog. Police dog. You've gotta speak up loud. yeah. Uniform. Jerseys. Body. Police lady. Lock.

Law enforcement, what a good way to end the conversation. Right if I can get the video there is a video somewhere in the police station that shows a lot of different police forces, but it's finding it. It may be too old it's, I think it's about twenty years old and we may not be able to show it to you. But if I can find it I've got a video that's over twenty years old. I'll bring it back, but otherwise good word. So right, the one thing, without calling out, if I assault someone, and that is punch them,kich kick them, hit them, do anything Murder them. Shh! There's about five people you can get really to dislike in this class isn't there? Right. If I assault someone and it is not justified, not justified, can I be arrested? Yes. Oh I'm impressed.

What it actually was was the, the initial of the person sitting next to you. Oh! Hello. Local rivalry unlimited as the two big footballing cities of the East Midlands lock antlers. And you know who's here to survey the wreckage if indeed there is any. Greavesey of course and at the risk of overdosing on goals you can see all the action that mattered from the First Division yesterday. And there's more, our profile of one of Europe's men of the week Aston Villa's Aussie Mark Bosnich. Now on the subject of Aston Villa we can confirm that despite today's report to the contrary, the two million pound transfer of Tony Daley to is on. The former England winger will shortly be on his way to Italy as we're about to hear from Ron Atkinson and Gary Newbon. There are reports in today's paper Ron that there are problems with the Tony Daley deal to Italy because of personal terms is this true? I don't think so I mean I left it all last night and everything seemed er amicable and er I haven't heard anything to the contrary today. Erm the way I understand the situation is Tony's happy with er his arrangement and that the clubs have agreed and I think it's just a matter of them going back now to report back to their President the Italian people and then the way I see it he'll he'll go after the er game for a medical and you know there shouldn't be any problems there. Looks good business at Villa I mean he's an exciting player but two million pounds that's a huge fee. Well in this day and age you get your reserve team player normally. Erm I think what it is I think it's a it's a it's a deal that's should suit all parties. I mean Tony's been at the club a long time he's expressed a wish to go erm his style and his age is probably just right to go on the continent, he's twenty six years of age and er I would guess that his particular style wou possibly would be better suited to continental play than it is in England. Yeah good diplomacy from Ron cos I think that's a cracking deal for Villa but anyway that's that sorted out . Not half oh. Let's turn our attention to today's little matter Leicester and Nottingham Forest. Yet another Midlands Derby and I think this season Well we've worked out each of the Midlands clubs has to play sixteen Midlands Derbies Yeah we which is great for us. It's great for us we we Is it good for them? well we say that but I mean they're not really Derbies. If you take the extreme Stoke Peterborough you wouldn't call that a Derby or Oxford versus Derby County. You would hardly call that a Derby. There are games in our region and as you rightly say they're great for us but er I wouldn't say that they're Derbies I mean the Derbies are are Birmingham West Brom and West Brom Wolves and Wolves and obviously today's game is a Derby Leicester Forest Derby yeah That's right but but you wouldn't say that they're all Derbies Tony would you not really I wouldn't have thought so anyway. Fergy's at the game is he? Yeah Alex Ferguson. Alex Ferguson I wonder who he wants er I I think it could be that he's after you know. He certainly needs some more players you know he's not got enough. Well we'll probably find out now let's er go straight over to Filbert Street where we can join our commentators Alan Parry and Ron Atkinson. Well the new Filbert Street taking shape the five million pound main stand official open since our last visit here and when the lower tier is completed by the end of the year the stand will house about ten thousand people all seated and under cover. One facility has already had plenty of use and that's the physio's room. Leicester have had to cope with a lot of injuries in the early part of the season the most serious blow the loss of Steve Walsh. His height and strength will be badly missed in attacked as Leicester field what must be the smallest striking partnership in the First Division. Julian Jochim the star of England's youth team last season is just five feet six inches tall and David Speedy towers over him with a lofty five feet seven. The message to Leicester's midfield is, keep the ball on the ground. Well Leicester could go third in the table if they win today and as Brian Little points out that's a big improvement on their early position. I think the last time you were here we were actually in the bottom half of the table but shot up to about seventh and since then once we got close to the people with games in hand and catching on the extra games we've come up into the top three sometimes. So today puts us back into third place if we win and and obviously we want to be there. And you hit a Forest team that's unbeaten for the last five matches. Yeah I think we're going to have a major say in what goes on this season. I mean er they've had so many problems injury wise I doubt whether they've played the same tw the same team twice at any stage this season and er on the day with the players they've got available they're going to have a a major say in this league this season. Well like Leicester Nottingham Forest have been ravaged by injuries. Carl Tyler and Gary Bull yet to kick a ball this season. Ian Leigh Glover making slow recoveries but at least there's good news in the return of centre half Colin Cooper who starts his first game for two months and two recently injured strikers are back in tandem, ironically the biggest partnership in the Division. Leading scorer Stan Collimore a massive six feet four and his sidekick Robert Rozario a diminutive six foot three. Does that mean Forest midfield will keep the ball in the air I wonder. Well Forest have recently enjoyed an unbeaten spell, Frank Clark a much happier man. Yes er we've five games now and er although we haven't won as as many as I would've liked at least erm we've stayed unbeaten. Er we're getting a few bodies back into the team emptying the treatment room and and things are looking a lot better. A very hard game for you this against Leicester but you do have Collimore in form. Yes I mean Stan missed Wednesday and I think we missed him and it's good to have him back today it it will be a very difficult game. You know I think Leicester are one of the er one of the real favourites in this Division to go up. It's a local Derby er and let's just hope it's a good game and everybody enjoys it. And the referee John Kirby from Sheffield starting the game and that's earlier than he should have done. You haven't missed anything though. Cooper gets the first header away. It's a very very windy day here by the way and cold as well and I think that's gonna have some affect on the game. Difficult to see which way the wind is blowing at the moment it's quite swirling. Anyway he'll judge that one well but it's er falls neatly for Gemmell and a good lay off here to Kingsley Black early chance for Nottingham Forest and really Kingsley Black will be as they say rather disappointed he didn't do better there Ron Atkinson. Well a great situation Scott Gemmell followed up the long ball picked up the as they ran at the defence and then he's committed to play it and then he's just just slid it in nicely for Kingsley Black on his left side. And really he should really have gone across the face of the goal with it. He's gone for the narrow side he's tried to squeeze it in the in the near post when he'd got all the far post to go for. But that's a shocking that's a shocking let off. And that was only about a minute of the game gone and I dare say er Ian whose place he's taking on that left-hand side would have relished that kind of opportunity. Anyway Leicester have won a free kick midway inside the Forest half. The ball set up for to drive it straight into the wall Speedy then tried the shot Oldfield takes over. And Leicester forced to go all the way back into their own half. This is Hill Speedy an excellent ball and a very good tackle on Speedy by Cooper. Speedy won't agree at the moment because he's writhing in agony and there's a little bit of retribution that followed that. But I personally felt that that was a good tackle on Speedy, Ron how did you see it? Yeah I think Colin Cooper stepped in to play very very very quickly and that's something I think Frank Clarke w will be looking for from him. He's he's a quick nimble defender Speedy was just hanging hanging on waiting for the ball to be played into him and I must confess I didn't really see anything afterwards I mean well if you look at that that doesn't seem anything untoward does it? Well he's probably just caught him on the back of on the back of the calf but er I thought it was as you say I thought it was a nice sharp incisive tackle. Another second Forest player seemed to go in then I don't know whether it was him that caught Speedy rather than Cooper with the initial challenge. Anyway David Speedy Yeah was in a little tumble job there but I I honestly don't think he if he caught him it was quite accidental. Yeah I'm sure you're right. And I was just thinking then that er Frank Clarke will want will want that sort of speed across the across the ground from Cooper, it's perhaps something they've lack in recent games stability at the heart of their defence of Notts Forest. Turn forward by Phillips and then Agnew captaining Leicester wins it back again. This is Whitlow driving it long to Speedy. Agnew loses out in the challenge in midfield but Gemmell manages to find Black not long for Collimore but too long. Gavin Ward has missed only one game in Leicester's goal since he arrived in the summer from Cardiff City. And with the aid of the wind got an awful lot of distance on that kick and almost earned side a corner, it was only just kept in by his opposite number Tommy Wright. I think the wind Ron is er behind Leicester's backs in this half. Yes you would you just wonder whether Forest back four might just push up a little bit higher and let the ball carry through to the keeper every time. Here goes Kingsley Black again getting in behind the defenders but he rather over played his first touch then. And the Northern Ireland International surprisingly finding himself in the clear twice already in the first five minutes, although that was er obviously not a chance. The first one certainly was. Cooper's header clear Thomson wins it back for Leicester, gets it back again from Greyson. Lovely passer of the ball Steve Thomson and he finds young Neil Lewis on the left and this lad's very effective indeed going forward. Hill and Collimore collide and Leicester did well to win that back. A long ball by Greyson, Chettle is underneath it. Kingsley Black A little bit unfortunate there Kingsley Black he's played he's played a nice ball down the side down the channel but that's the sort of ball Collimore would have thrived on. I don't think it was that Robert Rozario'd admit to being the quickest player in the world. But that so we think that's an area where Forest will try and try and exploit just playing down the sides of the er Leicester centre halves and let er Collimore use this great pace of his. I saw him play here last year for Southend and to be fair he absolutely ripped er the Leicester defence apart. Oldfield taking a bit of a risk there on the edge of his own box but Leicester got away with it. Lewis forward to Ormanroyd, Moore sticking very very tight and in the end pushing the Leicester man. And the free kick goes in early to Jochim. just cajoles his goalkeeper to come out and collect that one. Yes they're gonna have a little bit of a problem Leicester. I mean their stock play normally is er a quality ball from Thomson into big Walsh well you know with Walsh missing they they've gotta sort of be a little bit more inventive with their free kicks. Speedy can of course you know he's a good little leaper for a small lad but they're not just gonna be able to whack the ball up there. They're gonna have to play their way in. Yes incidentally Steve Walsh has er that serious knee injury ligaments have been injured I think they're still not sure exactly how long he's gonna be out. But it is gonna be a lengthy er injury and that is a major blow so successfully converted from centre half to striker. The linesman has flagged there and it's gone Nottingham Forest way. Just talking of Walsh incidentally he scored twenty goals in his thirty seven games since moving in to attack. That's how effective he'd been. Rozario calling for the high ball and wins it Colin Collimore won back then by Greyson and a difficult one for the goalkeeper as Phillips came in on him and Forest win the throw. Stewart Pierce very deep cross towards Rozario and it dropped nicely for Whitlow to clear. Speedy's lay-off Thomson collides the Forest man Gemmell and the whistle has gone eventually for a free kick to Forest. Foul on Steve Stone. Gemmell Rozario he's gone well here Rozario he's done very well and then he hit it straight against his own man. Collimore Thomson for Leicester Speedy Agnew Lewis on the left, it's a bit short that ball Lewis did well to get it. Now Agnew again, great ball for Speedy and that's the kind of defending that Forest have been missing from Colin Cooper Just hurt his shoulder then but he's er still holding it as play goes on and Whitlow quite clearly holding Collimore then Yes I think you saw there Whitlow's respect for Collimore he doesn't want him to get turn round and running at him because big Stan's got great touch and he's got very very he's got explosive pace. Here is Collimore Phillips down the right flank he was offside that was unlucky from Forest's point of view and Collimore dumped to the ground when he played the ball away then and er he's just holding er his shin just above his ankle there and Cooper is still in trouble from that er shoulder he injured moments ago Cooper's all right to continue and the Forest physio Graham Myers busy treating Collimore. Busy is something Graham Myers has been all season with all Forest injuries Ward with a free kick gets it clear straight to Thomson though Greyson Thomson Gemmell closes down the room immed that's a very good ball. Agnew Speedy coming in Ormanroyd then got in his way rather but it comes still to Thomson he lays it off to Lewis and the cross is too hard. Some good football there from Leicester City all inspired by Steve Thomson. Given time and space he's he's an excellent midfield player you know. He's got great feet he can pass the ball superbly and he he sees things he spreads the play. I mean he tried the Forest defence out on the left-hand side t to start with switched the player and got young Lewis in and really Forest could have done with a better ball er sorry Leicester could have done with a better final ball from Lewis. Well this is worrying now for Forest because Cooper's gone down again holding that shoulder. It's his first er match or at least the first he's started since the opening weeks of the season. He did come on as a substitute against er Oxford in midweek and Frank Clarke's first signing injured his shoulder in this collision with Speedy. Complete accident. Got a kick on the head as well. It's the shoulder that's giving him a problem and er that's always tricky because er it can er obviously affect the way a defender approaches the more physical aspect of his job. They can't really expect him to have a physical game this afternoon can they with David Speedy? Well another physical challenge in midfield seen there by the referee and Forest get the free kick and the ball was rolling when Pearce took it. It was a great kick actually out to Phillips on the right it was a pity it was moving. Still nil nil eleven and a half minutes gone. Chettle looking for Rozario and finds him and it goes towards Collimore just cleared in the nick of time by Whitlow. Now Oldfield for Leicester City. Greyson All too easy for Stone to win back. Nice control on the ball by Gemmell Rozario shakes off the first challenge from Whitlow and feeds Black. Has Collimore outside him and Collimore drives his cross in and is cleared by Hill Thomson playing it back in, difficult one for Greyson and he was a little bit fortunate I think there to find Thomson who's given it away anyway. Stewart Pearce Rozario wants it played in quickly. Oldfield prevented the cross now Collimore not quite and Agnew did well. Ormanroyd good ball for Speedy and on it goes to Jochim but it's too long. There's a little bit of a more measured ball there by David Speedy could have put Jochim with a real shout. He'd made a super little dart across the line of Forest defenders. Phillips straight to Hill and that's a long ball aimed at Ormanroyd Cooper across to cover and you just saw him grimace a little bit again there as he charged in on Ormanroyd. That shoulder obviously still him a problem he seems to be holding it a little bit awkwardly as it comes in to Speedy now. Chettle gets it away. That would be a little bit of a problem for Frank Clarke if er Cooper has got a problem with his shoulder you know if it's if it's serious because looking at his people on his bench you know Neil Webb and Crosby and looking at the make-up of his team he hasn't really got anybody he could slot back in there unless he put er Rozario in there. Yes that's true it's a good point. So it'll be er very important that the injury doesn't affect Cooper for too long here. Having said that he's been out that long you know Alan and Cooper he'll not want to miss any more football surely? Leicester City get the throw-in. Jochim won it Greyson not a very good ball Gemmell wins it back for Forest now Black forward Collimore's offside and that looked a very close decision. Ooh I'd like to look at that one again Alan . I mean that's bang in front of us and that's that's the sort of area they'll be looking to play the ball down the sides for Collimore's pace and I wouldn't wonder on it. I would wonder I made him, well it doesn't clearly show it there, I made him onside from our position. Meanwhile Agnew lifts it in and there is another offside decision and this time it's gone in Forest's favour. Speedy was offside. I think Stan Collimore's just said to the ref to the linesman on this side you know I started my run from m my half of the field but that would be a dangerous game to play against somebody with his pace is to give him too much space at the back of him. Oh that's a lovely header on as well it almost reached Rozario Greyson gets it clear. Chettle back into the Leicester half now Thomson and Agnew combining well and the first time Ball volleyed out towards Ormanroyd. Needs some help and gets it from Thomson who started this move off and lifted in towards Agnew, Cooper clears it still hasn't gone out and er Phillips just prevented it I think going for a corner, yes it's a throw. Thomson again for Leicester City looking very influential early on here. This is Lewis only nineteen this lad and very pacey and wins the corner. Yes you're spot there Alan erm Stevie Thomson is pulling all the strings for Leicester. I'm a little bit surprised Stone hasn't tried to get a bit closer to him although I think he's been given the job of tracking Agnew who's more of an attacking midfield player. Thomson takes the corner as well. Whitlow coming in on that near post the goalkeeper was very decisive then and er has benefited by getting the free kick Tommy Wright. Yeah that might be of those situations with the referee being over protective towards the goalkeeper. I don't really think he had a claim on that ball the goalie. I mean he's come out over the top of his own defenders and i over big Ormanroyd and he can do little else but push it back down into the pack. Couldn't really see how there was a foul there. Another free kick has been given this time against big Mike Whitlow Lively start to the game and a lively start for the referee. Eleven free kicks for fouls already. Gemmell swings the latest free kick into the box Pearce did well to win that one. Hill only half clear and that's a goal kick. But I think we're seeing something in the Forest side we haven't see for what twelve fourteen years are we. They just they th they refu you know they lift balls into the box now. I mean we've always associated Forest with playing their way into the penalty area now with Rozario er with Collimore they've got the licence or the facility just to knock long balls through the air at them. This is Kingsley Black and again he looks to use Collimore's pace and he moved into a great position there Collimore. Whitlow across to block he still gets the cross in that was dangerous. Agnew and Hill combining to get is clear but it's a corner and that cross caused real problems to Leicester. There's no danger if Leicester don't seal off this space. Here's that ball again up alongside. Defenders gone deep and kept Collimore on side and this is where you expect Stan to do his trick. Actually he's tried to play it in early there. Collimore will remain a threat from the corner he has just won. Rozario on the near post Chettle also has come forward for this kick and it goes in towards that near post area where Oldfield takes no chances. Second successive corner then for Forest and again it's aimed at Rozario who wins it this time that's dangerous. Scrambled away by Hill to Jochim. Lovely little turn he's deceived Cooper he's got the pace to go all the way here Jochim. How does the referee interpret that foul? Moore's the guilty player Jochim had got away from him and unless the referee decides that there was another defender coming round on the cover there Moores could be in big trouble. I think you'll find Cooper was just a touch deeper than him albeit very wide. I think Colin Cooper just got round the side of this a brilliant run from Young good turn and he's a he's attacked the heart of the defence and look at Cooper's position now I think he's just slightly nearer to the keeper than Laws. The yellow card for a foul on Jochim and but Laws will be relieved he certainly could have gone for that. Some referees might have interpreted that as a sending off offence. Whitlow driving the free kick into the wall and then lays it off to Lewis stabbed in and away by Collimore. Whitlow again finding Thomson now Agnew Pearce up well and Agnew on to it again Lewis Oldfield comes into the game Thomson. Good football this by Leicester Jochim across by Greyson Ormanroyd coming in on the back post. Pearce gets it away to Oldfield well he's scored some really spectacular goals in his career David Oldfield and he wasn't far off with that shot. I must confess when this one dropped down at him and he chested it out it's a lovely little bit of link up play by Jochim again. Good early ball in partial clearance I thought Ormanroyd might have got on that. Partial clearance here from Stewart Pearce. Now this is and I must admit when he pulled the trigger then I thought that was going to go right in the back of the net. But a good piece of attacking play from Weston. All credit to them they know they haven't got a big guy apart from Ormanroyd as an outlet player so they're prepared to be patient and build up and pass the ball al pass their way through. Leicester City in the middle of a good spell of form here. Seventh in the table of the start of play nineteen points from their ten games six wins a draw and three defeats. And unbeaten here at Filbert Street in six matches in League and Cup. Matches in hand on the sides all around them in the table and of course the team that has gone very very close to promotion the last two seasons loing losing in the playoff final. Looking in the mood and the form to be up there again. Greyson Gemmell comes in to win it back for Forest. Black was weak in possession and this is Thomson now Oldfield Lewis moving down the left and here he is eventually in possession. But he's lost it again, Forest throw. Stone no problem for Whitlow although that almost dropped in a bit short for Gavin Ward. We do see the problems we've seen it at both ends the goalkeepers have when people chase a lost cause like Rozario's just done there. You know rea no real no real problems at first but then they chase put the keeper under pressure and the keepers tend to panic. Midway through the first half here at Filbert Street still Leicester City nil Nottingham Forest nil but a good game. Good kick there by Ward Chettle wins it Thomson finding Agnew there's Leicester build now with Greyson Thomson Lewis making a run down the left Agnew wins it back again for Leicester, he's playing well. Thomson Jochim and Gemmell accepts the gift and then gives it back to Oldfield. And a little untidy period of play but here's Lewis to Ormanroyd Speedy sets it up for Greyson and in it goes again towards Agnew the captain and did that cross the line yes it's a corner. Well some of the football Leicester have played in this opening twenty o twenty minutes has been some of the best I've seen them. I I've probably seen them about four or five times in the last six months and they do tend to go a bit route one when Walsh is playing but today their link up play has been excellent. Thomson with the corner he's looking for Whitlow but it was headed by Rozario Thomson can try again. And that flicked off the defender and bounced kindly with Tommy Wright. But apart from this er for Leicester this Alan now they're starting to s squeeze a little bit and they've got to be a little bit careful they don't leave Collimore too much space to run into. But at the moment they're starting to dominate the game. Good header by Rozario Collimore couldn't control it and that's the sort of link up Frank Clarke'll be looking for. Ball onto Rozario a little touch through and then the blistering pace of er Collimore. Rozario wearing a vest I notice there Ron he wouldn't get into your team wearing a vest would he? Jochim turns it through to Speedy who couldn't repeat the dose. Here's Thomson and now Lewis turned back again by Ormanroyd and Leicester playing some good football in Forest's half. I think Leicester public are gonna have to be a little bit patient with their team. I mean Forest are pulling everybody behind the ball and you know they can't just sling the ball through. They're working is through and they they're playing some super little link up stuff. He's offside here it won't count. Long before er it got to Oldfield Speedy was offside. I mean we haven't seen an awful lot of er Julian Jochim yet but th the two occasions when the ball's been fed into him he's shown a brilliant ability to turn with the ball and get at the defenders. And I think if if people like Thomson can sort of give him that sort of service he's going to make life awfully difficult for the Forest de central defence. And his partner there of course Speedy he knows h you know he knows what's what in the game doesn't he. He's seen it all he's been there. Yes this is his eleventh League Club Leicester City. I was reading somewhere this morning where he'd been with eight clubs in one season. Good quiz question that one. Agnew turning it on towards Ormanroyd and the header by Laws was excellent. Back in the side now played six in a row. Des Little the signing from Swansea has been rested because er Frank Clarke felt he'd lost a little bit of confidence in Forest's poor start to the season. Ormanroyd wins the header Speedy flicks it on again and Chettle er Chettle rather got it away as Jochim came in on him. Collimore doing well there he really turned Greyson and he's got Black storming down the left and Rozario to the right. Good running by Oldfield to get back. I have to say I think big Stan took the wrong option then you know. It's still chances here for Forest Phillips playing it in again towards Collimore good one handed catch by Ward. I thought Collimore had good break three against two and I thought the the ball he should have played he should have measured a ball into er Kingsley Black's stride. It would have given a similar sort of chance to the one he missed in the first minute. Ormanroyd winning another header inevitably. Jochim to Speedy Ormanroyd's lay-off a good one for Lewis gets it in quickly on the left foot Ormanroyd and then Speedy collided the Christmas, er, particularly the summer holidays was extremely full in our areas that had these schemes, but it is true to say that some of the children did not pay their full amount. But they were kept going in it, rather perhaps at the discretion of those running the schemes rather than to throw them out, and as a result we did not have a scrap of vandalism in the area during the whole of the summer holidays. It's incredible to say so, but it's proved the case, and I feel very strongly on that as a result. Erm, parent involvement, there is no mention in this report about parent involvement, and I think this is absolutely essential that the, it's often the families who are poor parenting, because they've been poor parent people, and you have succession, and we've gone somewhere along the line, we've got to go down that road. The sort of way we can help is the mother and toddlers groups in this kind of thing, where the parents are involved and inevitably do learn quite a lot erm, about how to function and you know, to play with them, and the things that they enjoy. Introducing a lot of things they've never had before in their lives I'm afraid to say. Erm, and er, sometimes the under-fives provision, er, need assistance in rent. Now, this may sound also, but when you've got to pay five hundred pounds out a year, and you've got to fund raise and do it, often for young families this is a consideration. I, I put that as number four, rather than the first three, which I think are terribly vital, so I would be grateful if these sort of things were taken on board. Just a quick response, Chairman. What the Committee doesn't have the advance er, advantage of, er, is the accompanying documents to the paper that is before them, and I assure Mrs that those first three are covered in the documents and, and the strategies that we proposed. And indeed, fit very well into what we call the section seventeen budget, which is section seventeen of the Children Act nineteen eighty nine, which er, does enable the local authority to provide preventative services, to avoid the need for children to be looked after in care. It ought to be started as quickly as possible, as the child virtually is born. Any further points, comments? Okay thank you. We move on then to placement of young people from Shropshire out-county, marked N. Which is a bit more of the, I think, the discussion we had at last Committee and at the Council. Yes, Chairman, er Sorry. In a sense Chairman, the report stands, I mean I don't intend to add anything further to it, unless members er, really wish me to, it can be accepted. Okay, do you wish members to know Chairman, that you have a meeting arranged for ? No Only certain of them. Erm, if we move on then to item O, teen care. Item fourteen. Yes Chairman, er, during the budget debate at the recent erm, programme advisory groups, members er, had before them, as you have in the budget document, the possibility of selling a number of teen care places to other local authorities. And our members did ask for a more detailed report on the scheme, and this, this report er, set out that scheme in er, in a fuller way. It is a scheme that is er, an alternative to placement in children's homes, for adolescents with severe behavioral and emotional difficulties, erm, whereby er, specialist er, foster parents er, are, are, recruited, they are extensively trained, and er, have the willingness to take on what are difficult and challenging youngsters and er, who are placed with them. The success of the scheme erm, has enabled erm, some sale of places to other local authorities, and if I can just draw your attention to a slight error on page three, there is reference to Powys in two lines, and if you would delete please Powys one, placed in Staffordshire, er, it should read Powys two, placed by Staffordshire. I think from a financial point of view, what is er, of interest, and the economical use of these places as opposed to er, residential care, particularly specialist residential care, where p where we're able to provide er, at a cost of eleven, about eleven thousand two hundred and fifty pounds per child, as opposed to what can be considerable expenditure on er, on specialist out-county places. We currently have twenty nine youngsters erm, in places, erm, with a potential to offer forty three places, and erm, we are continuing to develop the scheme quite successfully. Chair, I want to say, it, it is a success, and er, that it's important to show you how diversion can work. Sorry, Charles, Chair, can we er, in noting the report, also is there some way in which we can, the Committee can convey its appreciation to the people who take on this, must be onerous responsibility er, er, and also can we congratulate the people who thought the scheme up in the first place. There's nothing like enterprise in local government. upon, I agree with you. Peter Well I was just going to say very much the same thing. I think it's an admirable scheme, and it's obviously very cost effective, and, and equal, and I, I think we should be very grateful that there are in fact a few caring people out there, and they're there to take this what could be a particularly onerous job on. What I was interested in at, at the briefing er, for the Committee, was that we don't actually go out and sell this in inverted commas, to other authorities, they come to us, because they've heard it's good practice. Er, which I think is, is excellent, and what I suggest is that we look at trying to get exposed in some of the professional journals really. Particularly as we, we've had a major issue in our budget proposals to do specifically on this, this, but I think if we have good practice in Shropshire, we should be sort of er, shouting it from the rooftops really, as this is very good practice. Is, is it possible to do that Mike? I mean, it's Yes, that's in hand to accompany Can I just quickly ask whether there's any cooperation with the youth service in taking these children out on, what I call a challenging activity like rock climbing, like at weekend residential, because you know, it, it seems cooperation there would be very beneficial I'm sure, in certain types of children who need the physical as well? It's not always possible for the teen care people to actually erm, have that expertise if you like. In other words, they can't go out themselves, perhaps rock climbing, they may have a lot of other attributes, but they haven't that particular attribute. Well presumably with, what we're trying to do is create some sort of alternative family units, we don't want, although, er, laudable what the youth service does, is, we wouldn't want, if they don't want to plugged, clubbable together, if, if, if, if the, the unit could provide that, or provide alternatives to pick up the, the correlation between that and, and ordinary normal family unit, I would hope that that would have been the best way forward, erm, er, because often some youngsters are in this situation because they, they haven't found the, that sort of provision has been helpful for them. Well I don't mean they have to join youth clubs but there is some kind of coordination. I mean, erm, I know my youth officer in my area takes them as individuals where the, they are youngsters who perhaps would benefit from that. He's going outside his brief if you like, he's doing a very good service. But surely Mr Chairman, if, if you want to integrate these people into the family unit they would go along with what the family would normally do. And the more they become integrated, then they would expand out, join the Scouts, the Guides or go to the local youth club, so be part of the, the er, growing up process which they haven't been afforded. That was my understanding and I got it right and discussed it with him Any further points? No sorry gov now let me think. It's called telepathy, yes. Any further points? No, okay, if we can move on then to, where have I got to now, Oh, P P right. Visits to social service establishments. Item fifteen Chair. Fifteen Fifteen sorry. Is that marked? Or just Oh, I'm so I'm sorry Mark. I, I, I think we, we haven't had an overwhelming response No In fact we've had an underwhelming response, I think at this present minute, and so could I put out the er, request again to members er, to consider coming to this seminar. He is very good, Mr , and he has been a county councillor in I think Staffordshire, before the days of pindown I have to er, hasten to add, but he does know both sides of the er, street as it were. One, one point that was made to me is, is it might be, it might be too late for this, but it might be helpful for some staff from residential establishments to actually get to understand what official visits are as well. Er, then there might be some confusion about the role of members, They've been invited They've been invited, well that's great, because I think often, sometimes it's a bit embarrassing for both sides. Okay. So that's er, noting for the diary. Now we do move to P. When is it? Twenty seventh of January. It's down on your pages, it's down on your agenda. It's on the agenda. Item sixteen then, which is visits to social service establishments. Marked P. Mr Chairman, just one quick, and that is it seems to me that there seems to be very few councillors attending. I went to two, and er, my name was the last on the, the form. There should have, there should have been three or four names, and that's, I'm talking about visiting residential homes. It's on, on the report, but it's I mean I don't, do we review the situation? I can tell you, we can certainly tell the er, yes. I mean the periodic, the, the intervals of visiting, and er, who has visited, but I feel very much this is er, an item for members as it were, That's right. members to members, and not perhaps for officers to interfere too much other than to give you background information, and it has been falling off, let me just say that. Mrs , next Can I just make a comment about one section of visiting, and that's when you have to do, er, Brookside, Wellington and Highfield. Doing them altogether, I find difficult to do, apart from the weather point of view, if it could be fitted to two maybe, you know you co you go to somewhere in Church Stretton okay, it's distant enough when you have one place to go, when you do the Wellington section, you've got four, and I find it very difficult to work and chase round to children's homes, to give it any . That's usually when there's three of us visiting. Ah, yes. Yes, but it'd be easier if it was two for the two. It's quite a bit to do on one day, to go and do four. That's the sort of issue Chair, that we shall be able to address on the twenty seventh. Yes, okay, then maybe you can mark that up then, and it might be that we, we might have to circulate all members again to see if they assume the situation of being able to undertake these particular requests er, about the visits. When we went to Telford and Charles, I think we did it in an afternoon didn't we, and that includes every single cul-de-sac in the area. Every road in the area to find the place. Anyway, went to ten o'clock one night , fit him well. Okay, moving on then, erm, where are you, Q Q, which is er, Age concern. Yes, Chairman I, I think members will be aware that er, we have er, always erm, enjoyed a very close relationship with Age Concern culture, and erm, they do invaluable work on behalf older people in the county, and I think like all organizations and in the changing climate, there was a need for them to er, to, to review their situation, and in, in the changing world, and I'm pleased to say that Age Concern recognized that there was a need to er, to adjust their relationship with the County Council, primarily to enable them to, to further develop and take advantage of the funding opportunities that are available now under the new arrangements for care in the community. So arising out of erm, very, erm, tentative discussions with Age Concern, with its officers and with their er, managing er, group, er, this proposal comes before you to enable them to, to become totally independent of the County Council. To be able to continue the activities that they have traditionally undertaken, er, with substantial er, grant and financial support from the County Council. But also to put them in position whereby in the future, as the needs for further services emerge, they will be able erm, to, to contribute with the department for, for those services for that er, appropriate funding. They provide another choice for older people in the er, range of agencies available to meet their needs. Because largely up to the present time in the er, as far as older people are concerned, then the only alternative to the current truth, and direct provider of services, has been the straight private sector. This would put a major voluntary sector provider in the, in the field. indicated Comments? Can I just query the cost of Cloverfield Hospice, I just wondered why that was so much more expensive than the others? Right. Is Cloverfield funded? Thank you, Chair, it's basically been allocated in terms of floor area, and what we've said to Age Concern, is in so far as we continue to provide them with premises, then we will, if we adjust those charges, we will adjust their grant accordingly. So in a sense that's the way the planning is currently allocated, it's allocated on a floor area basis. I suspect Age Concern don't require that but it's there, and they're the sole user of it at the moment. They will ultimately I presume, move into the new centre when it's er, when it's built and available in Whitchurch and it will need amendment at that stage. But on the financial plan Chair, Sorry, before you leave that, I mean, does that, do we still own the premises then? Yes. Sorry, go on. Erm, Chair, on the general financial position, it's, it's what I referred to earlier, as moving from somewhere where there were a direct employer or where we were grant-aiding a voluntary body to get on to a more, ultimately a more commercial footing, where we relate the money that we're paying to the services that are being provided. Erm, Age Concern have recognized that, and wish to move in that direction, although quite clearly, as far as the existing staff are concerned, in the initial move there were certain erm, reservations and wishes and er, and uncertainties which they tried to address in discussions with us and in this paper. And I particularly draw members' attention to top of the second page where you are requested to indemnify Age Concern for any redundancy costs that may arise in the future. I would stress that's redundancy costs in respect of service that employees have accrued whilst they have been directly employed by you. So it's basically Age Concern saying they're quite happy and the staff are quite happy about transferring but they're not happy on taking on board, er, er, potential redundancy liability which has arisen because they will employ these people directly. It is a relatively small sum that you're talking about here because there are not that many employees with long service involved, and so the indemnity is, in our terms not a sizable amount, but I can understand Age Concern's worries in terms of simply pick picking it up as part of transfer, and why we'd certainly recommend it to you. How would we transfer their, their pensions then, all their normal rights and everything else? They, they are entitled, if they elect to do so, to continue to be members of the local government's evaluation schemes, so they are eligible and have applied for membership on it. That report went to Resources sub-committee erm, and they should be allowed access to the plan, and continue their pension scheme. They really are a very vibrant organization, and er, I think we really would wish them well, and, and very pleasing to see them adapting to the new circumstances. The figures are, sorry, Chair. Could I ask Mr Chairman, just as a matter of interest, it's first community care as much as I,, really, erm, what, what if any, erm, alteration will there be to the volunt to volunteers that continue at the moment, will There will be There will be no, no, no difference in any circumstances? The big, the big advantage Chair, and one of the reasons that it appeals to us to, to go along with Age Concern on this is that, as you know, the area of activity in terms of day centre provision in which they are very active, is one whereby on the current grant mechanisms for community care, and our need to spend eighty five percent in the voluntary and independent sector, whilst they were directly employed by us, we couldn't divert a substantial amount of that money in their direction if they wished to develop services. This will enable to do that, and to do it in fashion where it still qualifies er, to attract grant if necessary. I understand that Mr . Okay, Chairman, I, I represent this Committee on the Age Concern County Committee, and I'll keep, keep an eye on it, I've, I'm as active, I'm as active as possible. I think it's a step in the right direction. I think we should erm, wish, wish them well. I think the only difficulty is that bound not the Boundary Commission, the erm, Charities Commission who er, have very awkward rules about things, which er, they could still er, still try to resolve. Okay any further? Is it a recommendation? Is that agreed? If we move on then to item R, which is item eighteen, Bridgenorth Community Hall. Thank you Chairman, erm, I'm not sure Chair, whether there are members still on this Committee who will recall the er, previous erm, proposal for a multi-purpose day centre in Bridgenorth. It was a, a project in the Committee's capital programme where it came potentially within the revenue budget. I know that there is at least one member here who had an interest er, in, that, that time. Erm, for a variety of reasons Chair, that proposal did not go ahead, erm, and I think probably the major reason in that was erm, the County Council's erm, inability to, to meet the cost of the project as it started to, to set up. But that, that wasn't the sole reason, there were a number of factors, but that was the significant one I think. So the project was dropped, the local community in the intervening time had er, picked the p the project up if you like, to provide a community er, resource in the low town area of Bridgenorth. It would obviously would be particularly relevant to, to the Lowtown area, but I think it should also be seen in a, the wider context of Bridgenorth and the surrounding area. It is not exclusively for the use of, of Lowtown as such. Erm, er, the funding for that project which I understand has a total cost in excess of a hundred and sixty thousand pounds, has been met from a variety of sources, er, primarily local, but with a contribution from the County Council through the Leisure Services Committee, and also through the Resources Management sub-committee, and in a, indirect sense, in that the, the, the land transferred to the County Council from the District Council for a particular sum, when the project didn't go ahead, the land went back to the District, and had appreciated in value in the intervening time. But in fact, I think it went back to the District at the er, price that it had Plus any interest accrued in the interim so erm, in, in some sense, it is with the Secretary of State's consent, erm, the land was conveyed back at less than market value as it stood, but erm, er, and I guess there are a variety of views on that particular er, aspect of the situation. Suffice it to say Chairman, in the intervening time the project has gone ahead with considerable erm, er, local support, both in terms of finance, but I think also in terms of the er, the effort that er, particular individuals in the area have put in to make this project happen. I don't think it's too much to say that erm, if they knew now what er, if they knew now what er, they know then what they know now, they'd probably never have embarked upon er, upon the project. They have brought the project to the stage where it is almost completed and only remains for the ba the building basically to be fitted out internally, and they have largely raised the funds to do that, but they are some ten thousand pounds short, and they came to erm, the Department with a request that we erm, assist them with this ten thousand pounds shortfall in the funding. On the basis that this would provide a resource in the Lowtown Bridgenorth area, that I suppose would do two things. It would erm, provide er, a base where activities could take place in that area, but whilst not, if you like, not directly benefiting the Social Services Committee, or the people that then go to it, would indirectly benefit us in that it would be available for youth and other activities in support of the community that have a knock-on effect er, as far as we're concerned. But secondly, would potentially provide an opportunity in future, where Social Services could in its direct role of developing services to assist older people and other clients of the Department, could base those activities, and that without this base available it would be very difficult to respond to the needs of that area. So they are saying please, erm, could you recognize the erm, the tremendous effort that has been made locally, er, and that erm, and recognize the, the value that this resource provides for the future of that community by er, assisting us to complete the project. Erm, er, the only way we could do that Chair, is erm, by use of, of contingency funds and er, one's aware very much of debates earlier in the day about the, the many pressures that the County Council and the Department faces, but erm, I would ask members to, to give very careful consideration to er, assisting to finish this project. Thank you Chair. Peter . I, I would like to support this Chair, and it's a relatively small amount, especially I don't know how much it would, it would cost, but erm, Andy the er, District Youth Officer, did produce er, er, a very much in-depth report erm, to the last of the Southern Area Youth Advisory Committee, erm, showing erm, how much demarcation er, the, the, the actual river does produce, and is very much a relatively deprived area, and I, I think for the amount of money that's involved here, I think in view of what he said then, I don't know the area at all, but er, I, I think he would be erm, very impressed with it. Gilly ? Thank you Mr Chairman. Although I'm not actually on the Committee of the Bridgenorth Community Centre, I'm obviously very closely connected with it, and as we've previously spoken about Age Concern, it is our hope that another day centre for the elderly will be set up once that community centre is up and running, because there are a great deal of elderly in that particular area. I mean, where we're situated in what we call Cellar Street, it's mostly elderly people so hopefully, it, it can be taken up erm, by erm, Social Services in that connection. I also understand from meetings, I'm meeting a group of social workers as I call them, that are dealing with the people with learning difficulties, erm, these are at present taking place in the Castle Hall. This I do know is not, is not at this place successful, not for people concerned with the, the facilities are not really adequate, and I understand that they also would be hoping to take advantage of this community centre. It is as we know going to be grandly opening, it has cost more than we anticipated as Bill's probably said, we found out we had to put the foundations on a raft, because er, It's in the river area, isn't it? Yes, the will be floating in the river when we went down to do the foundations, so it, it has cost a lot more money in, than we anticipated, and certainly in time and effort. And I do plead with this Committee to erm, let this go forward because it does mean that we will get our community centre up and running erm, in the spring with the assistance of this Committee. Erm, I, can I just ask? Has the particular organization applied elsewhere for grants as well? Oh yes, oh yes. And have you received any? Oh yes. Yes Chairman, of the hundred and sixty thousand plus cost, erm, part of the contribution by the major servicing committee, and I understand that they advised me the balance has been made from local contributions, and charitable sources. No, yes, yes, yes, yes. I mean the only comment, the only comment I'd, I'd make in relation to, to, to the scheme in principle I would support it. Erm, I think the agreement er, which is the l the last paragraph on the page, is a bit loose. Erm, But I've got a letter here Mr Chairman. Yes, hang on, hang on let me just, I think that agreement is a bit loose although I'm grateful to to mention those new specific groups er, because I think if, if we're, if we're allocating this sort of money, we would, we would want some er, some guarantees Only later Derek Some guarantees that, that, that, that er, sort of er, day care facility and possibly a facility for people with er, learning disabilities, that there would be room available on a regular basis, I mean it, I, yes That's in the letter I mean, if that, if that reassurance could be given then, then I, I don't particularly have a problem. I think there's no doubt, there's a meeting on Thursday night Mr Chairman, and I'll refer your comments to the meeting. Well I meant to say, if, if, if we, if there is an assurance that elderly people are going to be helped, and there's going to be a day centre there, I think we do handle the elderly pretty much anyway in this county, I would be certainly prepared to support it. He's pushing the boat by those comments isn't he ? Any further view? Well subject to, to that sort of reassurance Yes, I accept that Mr Chairman Yes, erm, are people in agreement with the recommendation? Yes Yes, as long as we get the insurance. Oh yes, Assurance, don't you mean? Assurance, yes Okay assurance, okay if we can move on then to item nineteen, which is motion Evening and Saturday Meetings. Comments? I move that we stay as we are. Yes, I second that. I've never been so popular. Is that why Peter's not come today, is it because I was going to say I support a Saturday meeting particular during the budget process, because it's more easier for me. Okay, well it's status quo, let's move this vote. Those in favour? Status quo Yes I think that's unanimous, dealt with that. The rate we're going we'll be here this evening until he pointed at me. Erm, item twenty, erm, which is advisory group. Can I propose Ted here? Ted 's been proposed, is that's seconded? Seconded. Any further nominations. No, Ted then. If we can move on then to the fourth page, item twenty one, it should prepared to move? No Seconded, those in favour? Against? Abstentions? Six of them. If we can deal with item S. Play on the screen there It's give it away. It can be helped anyway. I haven't heard anything about, I've had no comment from he's basically moving, and er, and Well, we're okay, we can go later , we'll go later. To, yes, we'll go do that . How's that? Didn't know you were back oh, right,yes, we can go back a week. it is yes, yes, not so bad and you? Yes, you missed all the, missed all the planning . Yes, yes, we can put that back to the eleventh, so there's plenty of time, okay. Right . This is the only establishment that's in trouble, er, we have information about other establishments.

I said bye then see you sometime, bye and I put the phone down, and she said what does she want then and I said oh she wanted to know where, you know she'd gone and I said oh I haven't seen her all week you know after, while we was hanging, she was hanging pictures, erm, she come through, she said oh they look wonderful she said I've got pictures she said, I want my mountain put up in my lounge, with that June burst out laughing, Neil went through and he, he put her pictures up and he was gone there, he said, god he said, you know literally it's a day to hang pictures, I said well don't worry about it, you know, that's what he said to do . like that little thing, you know, the actual picture hook with a hook The string. you just knock it in. Yeah well he's got brass wire on the he just, special picture wire it's called. And he spent all day with them. He had about thirty pictures to hang, and he had to measure it wall so it was spot on and he want, he wanted them all upstairs, he did, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight about twelve just downstairs in the hall way . What? Well they're not new blimming, new pict though they've decorated haven't they, they've done one coat now, I look like Nora Batty with wrinkles in this tights I told her to phone me from Woking station but she's probably er . well she put, cos she usually she buy phone card or what does she call, cos I asked her do you remember? Asked her what sort of coins she uses do you reckon they go with it, do they say on the front page then about that superstore. Yeah. What do they say, they're up in arms? outrage So where else will they then. They say, the trouble is they're, at cricket club they want it update.

Tesco's have done it, Tesco's he sell it to we buy it . But doesn't it cost them money? No, he, he don't . That's what I'm saying, when it costs, doesn't it cost Tesco's an extra lot of money? Yeah, but they get this . Yeah, but then don't they have to get permission? Oh yeah, oh it'll be a long mean fought out battle. I, I really don't see . But I can't see why they wanna put er a Tesco's, if there's a Sainsbury's coming to . Well, it all goes . They've got a Waitrose and , they've got Sainsbury's in Birmingham, but then again you've got . Yeah, but they're out of aren't they cos they're saying out from eight to eight sort of time, or sixteen a week aren't they, because of the competition with them all. Yeah, but I, I don't think it's,. Yeah, if, it's such, I mean. . But it's . Oh yeah, it's . That would go. They . The cricket pitch has been there for thirty five years. It's for it . No one 's and they can buy, they can re-build it maybe . That always . Well yes . Well there's a lot of land there because they've got opposite the church, that bit of land. . Yeah, but it's like that, I mean are they still wanna car park, are they still gonna put erm hotel there?. Don't know . What are those pretty things down there Brenda? Oh this is Carla's, were economising you see, this is Carla, wants to, Christmas presents, we've made them. Ah. They're chocolates. Ah isn't that nice. There's them and then there's, there's those, they're not as good as those ones. Oh that's attractive isn't it? Because they're, they're the balls in there. Yes. And these ones they've got just those erm smelly's in there, they're for her teacher's. Very nice. Yes, she made them for her teacher's as well, they'll chocolates . Go on , mm. So she had great fun making them. Do you want a cup of tea Dave? Yeah, I will. Want to put that on, I'll just nip upstairs oh. June was saying that all they're tubes all broke down. Has it? Got on one tube and that broke down from the end of she's at Liverpool Street then she had to go different end to Oxford Street, but she ended up in Charing Cross then she got on another tube line at Charing Cross and then that broke down, so she said it took hours , then she gave a taxi, had to get a taxi back to Oxford Street and, and from Oxford Street back to Waterloo and it's four pound and he gave her a change for a tenner instead, and she gave him a twenty pound note but, you know she's absolutely haggard, so I said it's just as well she can have a cup of tea before she goes, I just told her briefly about that so, erm, Carla's a bit late ain't she? It's just actually turning quite cold out there you know. Where? . Yeah, but . Fresh for three quid a week buy a trailer, want a trailer?through these sales people who . Oh my god one to ten it's got one in there already, so what have I got in there? . Which one? . That's the demonstration one probably. Oh no perhaps she had an extra, oh no it's already . Your pictures came out brilliant. and Dublin is everywhere in the novel, almost to the point where everywhere is Dublin. Is Joyce then moving back, rather than moving on? Both the terms and the meaning of that question are less simple than they seem. It is time we took up the second of my headings, language as screen. There too there is no straightforward unchallengeable meaning, but let's see how far we can get with one immediately obvious sense of screen — that it is a something, noticeable in itself, behind which other things happen. And the language of Ulysses is noticeable in countless ways, taking now to the staccato bursts of signal flickering half thoughts, or the ebb and flow of daydream, now to extended disputation, now to pastiche, now to grotesque imaginings, now to the flattest or the sharpest of conversational exchanges. The shifts in pace, in tone, in level, come at us without warning, so that even as one part of the brain tries to grasp at this or that, to make sense of it before moving on, the rest responds to the exhilaration of being swept along the verbal equivalent of a ghost railway. For among the effects is one that is new, and that nothing that I've said so far could have suggested this very exuberance, as well as the things it plays on, can make us smile or laugh. Take this tiny sample: Leopold Bloom, the Dublin Jew, with his touching mixture of timorousness and courage, has looked in for a few moments at a church as a Mass is ending. We grasp the occasion only through the disjointed reflections. Some of that old sacred music is splendid,mercadante , seven last words, Mozart's Twelfth Mass, the glory in that. Those old popes were keen on music, on art, and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrena , for example, too. They had a gay old time while it lasted, healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs benedictine, green chartreuse. Still having eunuchs in the choirs that was coming it a bit thick. What kind of voice is it? It must be curious to hear after their own strong bases — connoisseurs. I suppose they wouldn't feel anything after Kind of a placet, no worry. Fall into flesh, don't they? Gluttons, tall, long legs — who knows. Eunuch — one way out of it. Well consider again this brief moment, where we're given a new glimpse of someone last seen surrounded by a God-like power, the rector of Clongoes , where the young and impressionable Stephen had been to school. ‘He walked by the tree shade of sunny winking leaves, and towards him came the wife of Mr David Shehee MP. ‘Very well indeed, Father. And you Father?’ Oh Father Conmey was wonderfully well, indeed. He would go to Buxton, probably, for the waters and her boys would be getting on well at Belvedere. Was that so. Father Conmey was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Shehee himself? The house was still sitting — to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. Oh yes, a very great success. A wonderful man really.’ And from such moments as these we will be whirled to the uproarious, the piercing, the magdalen, the strange and the voluptuous. Our screen, then, is no colourless obstacle, but a bewilderingly decorated surface that constantly draws our attention, tempting us with the thought that here is all. That to read the novel is to attend exclusively to the detail of a patterning. And there are many readers, quick and subtle ones, for whom that is so, and for whom, of course, the sense of screen, which I have been suggesting, can serve no purpose. At the same time, this screen, these games with and in words, can even now frighten off those readers who feel they must always know where they are when they read, or irritate those who see the games as a form of deliberate teasing or provocation. But since it is part of my intention to suggest how and why the work of Joyce provokes exceptional division among its readers, I shall, for that reason and for others which will emerge, keep the notion of screen in front of you. And that takes us to the question of what it is that might be going on behind the screen — a question which leads not only forward and to Ulysses and beyond, but backwards, into a reconsideration of Dubliners and The Portrait of the Artist. For if, as I suggested, the enormous vitality of the language of Ulysses can, among other things, make us smile and even laugh out loud, that fact alone will underscore how little room there is for laughter in the earlier texts. Is this, then, the rescue that I spoke of? That certainly would fit very well with the familiar notion of a writer shaking off the anguished preoccupations of childhood and adolescence, free now in his maturity to put ironic distance between himself and that world, but it won't do. Let me catch up here some points left in suspension. There is first the fascinated attention we find in the stories that make up Dubliners. I suggested that the insistent gaze, the awareness of detail, were of the kind we associate with love or hate, while the persistent emphasis on traps or limits that can never be crossed belonged rather with the very different forces of pity or fear. Now these don't just add up or cancel out. The common claim the that the stories are remarkable for their even tone seems to me to miss the point. Love and hate are violent. They get things done. Pity and fear slow us down, or send us away. But there is one kind of feeling that can hold them all together — desperation. Not despair, not that last wild flailing about before we disappear into the pit, but desperation. In it we cannot go to any of the extremes because we are aware of them all. We are pulled this way and that, but the effect of these contradictory pulls is to leave us fixed in the middle. Now of course the stories are about people caught in this way. Such a one as Evelyn, who has the chance to escape with her Frank from the life of drudgery she has with her awful father. Frank, going ahead of her to the boat, turns for her. ‘She felt him seize her hand. ‘Come.’ All the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her into them. He would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron railing. ‘Come.’ No, no — it was impossible.’ And Evelyn stays, and Frank is gone, and the story is done. Evelyn and the others are, indeed, with greater or lesser urgency and awareness, immobile in desperation, but I want to suggest that for Joyce it is not the dispassionate artist's gaze which alone allows that strange steadiness commentators have called and even tone. It is not just the characters who know desperation. It confronts and surrounds Joyce too. Now he it is, of course, who creates them, and by that very fact can claim to have moved triumphantly beyond immobility — the overall achievement of Dubliners, and within the stories the hints of differentness of which I spoke. But what is for the most part in these stories a quiet desperation, is achieved at the cost of suppressing part of his own awareness, part of his own truth, and how bad that was we begin to see with The Portrait. Something else I've left hanging rather dangerously in the air is another and rather different hint, and because of the close correspondence of their careers, the milestones along their way, Stephen Daedalus is merely another name for James Joyce, so that the portrait itself would be a blow by blow account of its author's story so far, with the relevant identities politely concealed under pseudonyms. Neither the one nor the other is the case. And this we come at not through consulting Joyce's biography, but through attending to the forces at work in his writing. The space of desperation is a wide one, and if there is room in it for little stunted people, there is room too for figures that are a mile or an inch high. Stephen will be both. If immobility is one of its effects, the swinging between the extremes that bound it — love and hate, pity and fear — is another, and that is how Stephen will move. And if given to us as actual temptations, the rather lure of the church, the Reverend Simon Stephen Daedalus SJ, and the lure of the flesh ‘He closed his eyes, surrendering himself to her body and mind, conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting lips’. If these are given to us as actual temptations, there is no less of temptation in the resounding sentence that is the last but one of the portrait. ‘I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.’ There, indeed, is Stephen hero, a young Titan, who is about to topple the gods. The serene and powerful artist figure, who remains within or beyond or above his handiwork. Invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his finger nails. But Joyce, his creator, is watching him as one of his own timorous school boys might watch a particularly daring companion, admiring, fearful, disapproving, conscious of unresolved guilt, above all divided. Irishness and Englishness framed one difficulty from which language had to provide the rescue. Stephen has gone through confession, and is, he declares, ‘Ready to forge that language’, but he declares it in a language that will not yet take Joyce out of desperation. What language will allow his confession to be made and yet not heard will by itself bring absolution and so release hi, yet all the while create his novel. It is as part answer to that question that I have put forward the notion of language as screen, the dazzling play of words and tones, fragments, sequences, movements this way and that — calls constantly to the eye and ear of the reader. But even as eye and ear follow the darting changes here and there, as if they were the only reality, even as that happens we are made aware that the great screen is showing some sharply outlined human scene — the easy or awkward coming together of acquaintances in this pub, that cemetery, this newspaper office, that maternity hospital, library or brothel the making and the unmaking of friendships and hopes — the experience of solitude. And then the scene itself divides. In one version it is the highly particularized action of networks of people in the network of streets that is Dublin on one day and another, suggested to us as early as the title and continued through innumerable associations and hints, it is a vast and teeming world through which and erratic journeying is taking its course in space and time, inner and outer. These intimations of universal and particular timeless and now reach readers whether or not they have learned to call the sections of Ulysses by the names of episodes, characters, or places taken from the Odyssey. Granted all that richness and diversity, to talk of language as screen may well seem simply perverse, even ungrateful, but just as we can't attend to the patterning without also seeing the patterns, the scenes, so the whole virtuoso performance is counterpointed by a performance of a different kind, the intricately woven language screen. Looked at from another angle is the grill of the confessional. There is a murmur of many voices about it, but the one that comes through is not that of Stephen Daedalus, a little older now, but still recognisably kin to the Stephen of The Portrait, not his voice, but that of Leopold Bloom. Bloom is physically unimpressive, is incapable of Stephen's fierce intellectual of aesthetic leaps. He lacks social adroitness, or any kind of personal magnetism, as he struggles to hold down a charmless job which depends on the goodwill of others. He is Jewish — that is condemned to be an outsider in a world which knows only the Catholic many and the Protestant few. He is a husband who recites with dull pain the continuing succession of his wife's lovers, while he must comfort himself with fantasies — his own, or the kind printed on cheap paper. How can he matter? In the screen of language the words that make him up are no more than some amongst many, a detail in the pattern, as a grotesque might be in early painting, or the straight man in a comic duo. But in the novel of which that screen is part, in the total enterprise, he matters very much and in different, crucial ways. To start with, there is separate screening mechanism for Bloom himself. He is presented to us in the first instance, and decisively, but his failures, his weaknesses, his inadequacies. The small, sad, trapped figures we met in Dubliners were, for the most part, you might say, given a quick deliverance, each firmly located within his or her narrow circle and then left. It is as if the economy, the restraint of much of the writing passed over onto them to give them a curious accidental dignity. With Bloom the most secret stirrings of bowels or brains are exposed. The defeats and backslidings are not only those forced on him by others, or by circumstances, but those too, less pitiably, which come from within him. It is as if he were all The Dubliners rolled into one. He is everybody's butt, not least that of his wife, Molly. Yet, too keenly aware of his own different failings, to be able to outface them all. Such aspirations as he has are short-lived, stick almost in the throat, as the notes of the song might in the throat of an unconfident would-be singer. And so gently, uncertainly, yet doggedly, he makes his way along through this day as, we must suppose, through the whole of his life thus far. Why then, given all this, do we see and hear so much of him? If he can be put in his place by anyone, young or old, male or female, why do we come across him everywhere? Can the great Odysseus , strong and decisive, have shrunk to this Ulysses? Well the obvious explanation is that that is the point that our modern hero, the connecting thread that runs through the whole design, can have none of the grandeur of the ancient one. But again, and in more than one sense, we see too much of Bloom for that to be the whole explanation. We can get a little further by remembering that the affect of the screen is to present him by way of his weaknesses and limitations. So unambiguously marked are these, that they draw attention away from other features of his — his odd stock of knowledge and his quiet eagerness to increase it — his unassuming inclination for the arts, and particularly music something different from the practical awareness that comes from being married to a singer — his compassion — his steadfastness. We do not always laugh when all or any mock him. We do not always dismiss him when he is left trailing by the brilliant or the powerful. I have suggested already that he is all The Dubliners combined — the lost child, the resigned girl, the lonely or frustrated man, the seeker of false comfort — now I want to come at his importance from a different angle. The Stephen of The Portrait also knows intermittent humiliation — the brutality of school fellows, or teachers, the sole grinding slide into poverty, the self-revulsion at sexual indulgence, the after effects of surrender to the embodied authority of priests, the awareness of cultural isolation. But however low he is brought, the urgent forward and upward drive of the writing gives us such moments as stages on the way to eventual triumph. The humiliations may show us the strength of the opposition which the world, temporal and spiritual, sets up against him, but they promise too the kind of imaginative and moral strength which will raise him about it. They herald those final reverberant sentences in The Portrait. But I suggested too that the resolution — this resolution — was something that Joyce saw and wrote, not something he yet new. Stephen can confess his weaknesses, but he can go on to say ‘You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets.’ He can break out of the space of desperation. For Joyce there is unresolved business. There is first the admission of cravings, sexual and other, felt as unspeakably ignoble, and there is the unappeased fear that the very gifts on whose existence all rescue depends might be mere fantasy, delusion. That he may be destined to drift helplessly, tormented by unrealisable and therefore useless dreams. A bit of a singer, a bit of an artist, a bit of a man. If Bloom is every kind of Dubliner it is because it falls to him to transact the unfinished business, to enact it and to get beyond it without dazzling gifts. As he makes his way along within the quiet desperation of his life, he must reveal himself to us as cuckold, fetishist, masochist, outsider, victim, inferior, loser. Only that order of revelation of confession will permit recognition. Bloom is not, and will not become, a hero. He is not Joyce any more or any less than Stephen is, but Stephen can only fly by the nets of nationality, language, religion and artistic mediocrity because Bloom cannot. Bloom must accept a particular life so that Joyce need not, and Stephen must be shown in his byronic self-deception so that Joyce need not. The stories of Dubliners are not only disturbingly sharp representations from outside, they are fed too from inside by an intuitive closeness, an awareness that comes near to identification with these and those victims, male and female. Stephen and Bloom are brought together in the final stages of Ulysses so that at last the space of desperation can be closed, the vertical pull of Stephen's iron ambition, set against the downward sucking force of Blooms ordinariness. The new writing can go forward without being founded on a central lie. The most famous of all the sections of Ulysses, Molly Bloom's final soliloquy is above all a celebration of that freedom, and the freedom thus won. Molly is not every woman, or indeed any woman. She is, above all, Joyce's central recognition, exultant recognition that yearning is not defeat and identification is not a proof of some fatal inner yielding to the pull of mediocrity. The vivid renderings of human prisons that we find in Dubliners are intensified, I have argued by secret sharings. And the deepest of those secret sharings are with the child figure, the earliest stories of course, and with the women. Evelyn, or Maria, in the story Clay, or the nameless girl in Two Gallants, or Greta Conroy in The Dead. For these above all, the culture insists, must hide their wound beyond the receiving end of experience, whatever their gifts or desires. The issue of identification takes off, we have seen, in a different direction in The Portrait. For here the emphasis is on the emergence of Stephen's strength from the very depth of his own weakness. But as we also saw, that strength comes too soon, denies too much. It is indeed still there, to be built on, in Ulysses in the further elaboration of Stephen, but it cannot be fully achieved unless the wounds are acknowledged. And now it is a man of sorts who carries that acknowledgement. A man who is a new kind of victim, Bloom the Jew, the semi-talented outcast. But I said too a man of sorts, for the acknowledgement now includes crippled masculinity, and with that Joyce is free to embody and enact a different fear hinted at before in, for example, The Dead, but masked by the victim's status of the woman thrust on so cruelly by the culture. But the culture can be not only cruel but stupid. What if real sexual freedom, real potency, real power, belonged in fact with the woman? Molly's mixture of self-loving languor and irrepressible vitality is a splendid realization in its own right, but it also conjures a profound fear. And so it comes about, at the end of all the wanderings, that we find under one roof, in decaying Echo Street, that strangest of couples, Molly and Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedalus. Now at last dream and reality, part and whole, strong and weak, art and life, active and passive, can be confronted. Joyce has pulled together the separation representations of his inner world, achieved his rescue and finished his novel — cause indeed for celebration. But there is a world of difference between celebration and victory. If there is any one awareness common to the great modern writers, it is that language will not do our bidding, that good or bad intentions do not so much pave roads, as poke up odd coloured weeds through the roadway. That something actually achieved in writing gives no assurance, to reassurance for any writing still to be done. It is a version of something we all know now, and largely thanks to them. For if, as ordinary people, we are acutely aware that when it most matters the words we say are not thunderbolts from heaven but hostages to fortune, ways in which we reveal ourselves in our limitedness and imperfection. If we are aware of this, we at least know that it must always have been so. What in their different ways a , a , an Eliot, a Kafka or a Beckett — what they have had to come to terms with his the death of a tenacious pervasive yet curiously imprecise myth that somehow writing was different, that the masters of the past could in some way overcome this limitedness, that writing carried its own justification. With the myth gone, they were faced rather with what Eliot called the intolerable wrestle with words and meanings, or, as Beckett was to put it, nothing to express, nothing with which to express nothing, from which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express. In this perspective to set up as a writer at all is an extraordinary act, while artist becomes a word only to be invoked only of others, never about the self. Yet it is just this act which Joyce accepted to do. The energy and the single-mindedness with which, following on the achievement of Ulysses, he carried it through can still amaze us. For if, as I have argued, the dual difficulty of Englishness versus Irishness and of the divided self had lent and existential urgency to aesthetic ambitions and convictions, that urgency had surely gone. Dublin and the past had been exorcised, even as the new fiction had been created. But creation and the means of creation had thrown up a new an utterly unexpected difficulty. If Joyce's energy had been concentrated in the forging of a language adequate to resolve all that had been, then that language, whatever else it had done, had achieved something for him. Something remained out there which had not been subjected to the same refining fire. That something was language itself. It is to the netting of that protean reality that Joyce now bends all his energies, and my mixing of metaphors can give no more than the faintest hint of what that strange act entails. It is this that I had in mind in proposing at the outset my three notions and calling one of them, the last, language as replay. Replay — somewhere between re-run, the taking up again of a game, return match, and revenge — somewhere in that space is the verbal world called Finnegans Wake. Within the frame that we have never left, Dublin, and which we meet again in the opening sentence, is to be enacted strange as the dreaming that permeates it, Joyce's relation to his languages, to language. Past, present, future, here, there, inner, outer, self, other, quotation, allusion, portmanteau word, syllable, letter and grunt — all whirl about two poles, their names forever changing, their enduringness graspable only by initials, A L P — the river, the Liffey, the woman and H C E, the man. And as in Dreams separate realities can fuse in a single image or sequence, so here words fuse as Joyce attempts to cast in a single form the body of his culture, the depth, variety, the body of his feelings — the feelings of his body. Here indeed is the assault on the gods, Stephen's boast unimaginably extended. In view of this, it would be no more than proper and right for me to talk in some in great detail about it, but I am not going to, and not just because I have an eye on the clock, or an ear for the protest of stomachs. Perhaps I can explain, and in order to explain I'll tell you a story, a literary story. When we read Eliot's The Wasteland, we know we can never hope to speak it aloud satisfactorily. Even as the siren voices in the poem call us towards speech, we're aware that our own one voice can never hope to carry all these as we would want it to. But they do call us towards speech, so that at least in the urgency and the felt inadequacy of our attempt to speak, erm to speak those words and lines, we can act out something of the quality and kind of our response, our shadowy awareness of what these incomparable and shrieking voices meant to the Eliot who was fighting for his own voice. Such attempts as we can make are essential. Catching up, however badly, our recognition of the decisive tension between eye and ear. I can conceive no response, no criticism which does not include the practical recognition of that tension, but such is the nature of Joyce's last venture that I cannot, without cheating, read to you from it. It is to the eye that you must turn if you are to read Finnegans Wake. Here in the final work, the shaping of a total unity, there returns a crucial division, and because I cannot read from it, even badly, I will not talk about it, which leaves intact your freedom to go and read it. Read this proliferating, surging, skipping, mocking, smiling, looping torrent — what an enterprise it is — a man taking on human language. And not just some great abstract notion either, for the assault bears also on that aspect of language which embodies authority, the rules of language, those terrible received truths, which at least the older ones amongst you will remember. That a preposition is a bad thing to end a sentence with, or that you can't have a sentence with out a verb. That certain words are less acceptable than others. Above all, that the word is the irreducible, the minimum unit, itself enshrined for every in the silver columns of the dictionary. Division then returns, for this is a struggle to the death, or life. The very notion of struggle will, of course, trigger widely varied responses among readers, quickening some, frightening others, bewildering yet others again. But if writing is not done in neutral ground, neither is reading. Let us therefore remind ourselves of the huge distances, inner and outer, that Joyce has travelled, and take one final look at his total undertaking. There is a famous line by another Irishman, Yeates, a line too often thought to be transparent ‘Romantic Ireland's dead and gone’. Don't you believe it. Thank you, Hercules. I am very sure that you will agree with me, if I may borrow a phrase from Joyce, that we all hope that it's not at all unlikely that George Craig will come again to preach. His preaching was an outstanding success, and whatever exceptional divisions Joyce's work may continue to provoke among his readers, and whatever perhaps less exceptional divisions George Craig's lecture may create among some of the audience in respect of the substance of his arguments, and how could it not given the generous measure and richness of what he offered, there would be no division on the quality of his craftsmanship and the beguiling nature of his themes. If I may speak as one who has heard all the centenary lectures and restraining myself from being invidious, I will merely say: George, it was an admirable centenary lecture, and the huge spinning top of words, despite its complexity, kept the patterns clear and sharp and arguable. I got some very new insights, in fact I'm going to look up to see whether Bloom's reflections on the eunuchs in the erm church were written in the same colour as some passages in Molly Bloom's soliloquy. Most important of all, I think, there was an air of excitement, enthusiasm and high intellectual quality. What more could we ask for? Thank you very much indeed. Hello. The parents of children with dyslexia and other learning difficulties face their own set of problems. Today on Ideas in Action we'll discuss these problems and suggest some options open to local parents. To start with I went along to visit local parent, Mrs Audrey Durrant, who told me the main problem she faces as the mother of a ten year old dyslexic boy. Trying to get the child to go to school. There's usually some sort of scene in the morning. He doesn't want to get up or get dressed and get off to school. There's some worry about something — either he's not going to be able to do the work, someone's going to laugh or has been laughing at him, he doesn't think the teacher's going to understand, and it's generally a terrible problem first thing in the morning to get him to get ready and get to school. What do you do to encourage him? Try and find out what the problems are and find an answer to them, but sometimes this is extremely difficult. Sometimes he's so determined he's not going to go that we have to forcibly put him out of the door and get him into the car and get him there somehow. As a parent, what would you like to see happen in the schools, or what sort of schooling would you best think would suit your child's needs? Well I don't think an ordinary school can really cope with a dyslexic child, and I don't think it's fair to expect them to do so. I mean they have all the other children to teach and a dyslexic child has certain problems which need individual care and attention. Therefore I think it would be a better idea if units could be set up and the children could be taken out of an ordinary school for perhaps one or two or three years, according to how much time is required, where they could give the individual attention and the specialist teaching to help them to overcome this particular problem. How did you first recognise that your child was dyslexic? Well we'd always had the problem going to school. He seemed bright enough and very eager to learn, but when I went to the school to see his work I found that his handwriting was very, very bad and his spelling was absolutely atrocious, and although he was good at mathematics, as time went on he began to get very worried and very upset about it and when I looked at his work I realized that he was doing a lot of the words back to front and was getting the direction of figures mixed up. Reversing the numbers? Reversing the numbers. If the answer to the sum was twenty four, he'd put forty two, and starting the sum the wrong side and getting very confused. And then I began to become very worried about it and it just happened by chance that one Friday morning I heard a programme on Radio Brighton, and it was Doctor Wisbey speaking about dyslexia, and it dawned on me immediately that my son was dyslexia. And so I wrote in to Radio Brighton, and Doctor Wisbey very kindly saw my son and confirmed that he was, in fact, dyslexic. Do children with learning difficulties have problems other than reading and writing? Well Mrs Durrant says yes. Usually there's a co-ordination problem. Things like skipping were extremely difficult for him to do, playing football, running, all of those are very difficult. I asked Mrs Durrant what suggestion she could offer local parents whose children have similar difficulties. Well I think if you think that there's something wrong, see the teacher and the headmistress immediately. Ask if you can see the Educational Psychologist to discuss the problem with them, and really try and get specialist help. And if your child is dyslexic, reassure them that they are not the only child, there are other children who share this problem, that they in fact are not stupid, or mad — and quite often they think they are mad, they can understand what is wrong with them because they don't really understand what they're supposed to be doing. There are many adults who've had to face up to this problem and have, in actual fact, overcome it Susan Hampshire is one; I believe Hans Anderson, also, has suffered from this difficulty — that with help they can overcome this and live a normal life. I know you and other parents with you are working to set up a special dyslexic unit in the Brighton area. How are your efforts going and what do you hope to accomplish? Well we very much would like to start a unit in January, but this is extremely difficult because of all the cuts in education and the education office really hasn't got the money to start a unit now. We are desperately, desperately, in need of funds. I think it's about five thousand that we really require to establish and equip this unit. We've had coffee mornings and various other sales, but they're very badly attended. We had one yesterday — hardly anybody came. This is very disheartening and very disappointing because this is a major problem and it makes so much difference to the lives of these children. Some of these children, if they were given this attention over a two year period, could overcome this and go into the secondary school able to cope and take their place alongside the other children, and this is desperately important. Dyslexic children have so many interests and this is very frustrating for them. My son, for example, loves science, he's very interested in engineering, he's interested in astronomy, he wants to find out everything he can about them. We go to the library, he goes round the library, he gets books out that he wants to bring home and read, and of course when we get home he's not able to read them. I try and read as much as I can, but this extremely difficult when one's a mother with a family and there are other children as well to look after. The worst thing for my son is that what he would like to do more than anything else in all the world is to be able to read like other people. Where can local parents turn for help with such problems? Well one place is the East Sussex Dyslexic Association. Chairperson Mary Nash-Wortham states the Association's Function. Our Association was formed nearly ten years ago and is aimed at helping parents to solve their children's problems through a local based scheme where they may contact a teacher who's qualified in their local area and that teacher will see the child and advise the parents whether individual tuition would help him. Any parent is very welcome to contact me as Chairman of the East Sussex Dyslexia Association on Eastbourne three four seven six two. The address is sixty eight, Pashley Road, Eastbourne, or our local contact, who is a teacher, Mr David Pollack of thirty, Coleman Street, Brighton. Other options are available to parents, both inside and outside the schools, Mary Nash-Wortham reports. Local parents should discuss the possibilities with the head of their child's school, and if possible get the child referred to the psychologist, who will assess the child for intelligence. If this method is barred because the headmaster does not agree that the child might have a learning difficulty called dyslexia, then the parents will have to go outside the school system and possibly go to the Dyslexia Institute at Staines, where a full assessment is carried out, with a report, which is sent to the parents. Unfortunately this is not part of the National Health Service, and the parents will have to pay a fee. Miss Wortham stresses that children with learning difficulties can be helped with remedial work. Certainly there are a number of children who can be helped quite easily, depending on the density of their problem. The older the child is the harder it is for him to overcome his difficulty, but there are courses and there are techniques available which definitely do help children to overcome their problems with reading and with spelling and with language as a whole. I've been particularly interested in the clumsy child, who has co-ordination, rhythm and timing difficulties, and I have written a booklet which is now available for parents and for teachers who are interested, for the age range five years to eleven years, which gives parents exercises to carry out with their children to encourage the child in overcoming difficulties with co-ordination, rhythm, timing, and to help them with speaking, writing and reading remediation. What sort of remedial techniques can parents use? Mrs Durrant describes her own method. When I started I had to right back to the very beginning and start from three letter words. We did a great deal of work with music and in listening to sounds and in rhythms, and then a lot of work in which I actually read to him and he followed all the time what I was reading, so that he would try to link the sounds and the words together. And then we've gradually worked on building up the spelling. We've worked on building up handwriting. Fortunately I was myself very interested in handwriting and had taught it. It has entailed a great deal of study on my part. In fact I've scarcely been to bed before one o'clock any night since I first realized he was dyslexic. Remediation works best, though, when parents and teachers co-operate, as Polytechnic Lecturer, Rod Smart, reports. I'm quite sure that the way forward for teachers and parents is within some kind of co-operative framework, and the only way that can work effectively is for each to be aware of other's needs and difficulties, and the kind of barriers that have existed in the past for parents to get into schools I think are being lowered by the schools, but it takes almost a generation, I think, for parents to stop being frightened about what school is doing and the kind of parents who've had bad experiences themselves in schools, I think, have enormous difficulties in approaching teachers and I'm sure the answer is in terms of co-operative activity — children and schools, schools and parents, and all of them together with myriad of outside agencies that are available for children with severe problems. Local parents may also band together in support groups. Mary Nash-Wortham and Mrs Durrant agree that these are most important. I think if parents are concerned and feel that their child is brighter than his performance shows, then it is time they took some action. The path is not easy for them, because they will be blocked by suggestions from the school that their child is a late developer, he's lazy, or that he doesn't like working, but this should not deter them. They must take action and they must feel free to contact us, feel free to put their point of view across to the headmaster and to ask for a psychologist's report. And they must join with other parents who've got a similar difficulty, so that we can fight this very wide cause. I think there should be a centre where the parents of dyslexic children could get together. It's so difficult and frustrating for parents and one feels so isolated, and one needs to discuss these problems with other parents and the parents working together, of course, could do so much in erm getting units started and getting people to understand this problem. There's so many erm handicaps that children have that people can see. They're obvious. But this can't be seen — it isn't obvious — a child can become the subject of ridicule and for a sensitive and intelligent child this can be sheer hell. Many thanks to Audrey Durrant, Mary Nash-Wortham and Rod Smart. Again the local numbers to contact for information about learning difficulties are — Mary Nash-Wortham at Easbourne oh four seven six two, and Dave Pollock at Brighton six nine four three seven nine. Next week on Ideas in Action we'll discuss the emotional problems associated with learning difficulties. Until then, goodbye. Hello. When we started building the university twenty years ago we encountered a very unusual problem. This arose because although the site was nearly ideal for our purposes, right in the middle there stood a small cottage in which lived a retired shepherd, Amos Chatfield. Because his rights as a tenant were protected and because in any case the university didn't wish to be seen turfing out an elderly man whose family had lived in the same cottage for five generations, we left him in peace and build around him, as it were, expecting him perhaps to move elsewhere or maybe to pass away. But now, twenty five years later, Amos is still in our midst. Instead of finding students impossible to put up with, he appears to enjoy their company and they in turn appreciate him. He must now, by my reckoning, be nearly a hundred years old, but in no way does his enthusiasm for life appear diminished. Although publicity shy, he recently and rather reluctantly agreed to be interviewed in his cottage. And here I apologise for the rather poor sound quality, but he refused to shut his parrot and dogs in another room during the interview. Hello Mr. Chatfield, can I come in? Oh yes Mr Smith, the dogs won't hurt you, honest, they won't hurt you. Come in and I'll make a cup of tea. Thank you very much. Well let's have a cup of tea in a minute. There are just a few questions I'd like to ask you. Oh, don't worry about Corky the parrot. All right. How long have you actually lived in this cottage Mr Chatfield? Well I've been here, it must be thirty five years. And how old are you really. Well I've been I really don't know. I wasn't born really because I didn't have a birth certificate or anything so I don't know how old I am. Well you must be getting on for a hundred, because I believe you were in the Boar War, weren't you? Yes, that's right, Mr Smith, I was out there, oh I don't know how long it was. I got wounded, you know. I was a Corporal and I got wounded and erm it makes me cough. Oh, sorry about that. Mr Chatfield, you've been here for, well, as you say, thirty five years — what was it like in the old days before the university was put here? Well as you know I was a shepherd and I used to look after the Chichester Estate and we used to have a lot of erm lot of erm sheep in those days. I find it very difficult to breathe, but it was quite good in those days because they used to pay me well and I used to get up very early in the morning and go round with my dogs and that. Well you do get on very well with the students and they are very fond of you. What do you attribute this to? Well they keep complaining about the refectory food so they come over here and have mutton stew with me from time to time, and they I quite like their company. They bring me dogs bones for the dogs and they like talking to my parrot I wish I could get rid of the bleeding thing though. Well how long have you actually had the parrot. I mean life wouldn't be the same without you, of course, and without you parrot. Well the parrot he sort of came in the Boar War he did he sort of flitted on my shoulder and I've been lumbered with him ever since and nobody seems to want him. Well he is a rather unusual parrot, but not a very well behaved one . No, he's not, he cane be quite rude, can't he ? Yes, well, I think we'd better leave his ruder sayings off the air at the moment. But you're obviously very interested in animals. Now you've got what, nine or ten dogs? Well it's eleven actually Mr Smith. I used to have three but I lost three sheep down when they built the university, and I haven't been able to find them, so I thought that they'd be useful to try and locate them, you know. It's very difficult, I had to pay for the sheep when the Chichester was here. How do you manage to look after eleven dogs? We know that they are sheep dogs and very active, I mean what do they do for exercise? You're joking — active?— look at them, they're all asleep. There's only one awake and he can't do very much, and I just don't know what to do with them. They don't move for me any more and I can't whistle either. Well there are rumours that the dogs sometimes attack the students, or chase them. Is that true? Oh they don't attack them, they're only playing with them. They come out of lectures and then they round them up and put them in a small group, you know. It's quite funny to see them all in this group worried about these dogs. And what do you actually attribute your long life to? Oh that's a difficult one. I suppose erm modern living. As you can see, I've got gaslight and that's quite modern isn't it and what's this we're on — radio? What's radio? Well if you you surely have heard of radio? No, not at all. I mean nobody tells me anything round here. The students come in, but I don't know what else is around. Well I'll explain what radio is afterwards. It would take to long to do it justice. Well, you know, I mean I'd like to know. What's this thing stuck up my nose? That's called a microphone. A microphone? Yes What the hell's a microphone? Well I'll tell you afterwards. Well I don't know what it is. Okay here isn't it. Well anyway Mr Chatfield, thank you very much for allowing me to ask Well don't you want to ask me any more questions? No, I think I've asked you quite enough, and thank you very much for talking to me. Well, you know, I mean I'd like to know if I've answered them right, you know. You've answered them absolutely right and thank you very much. Would you be quiet just for a minute. Well, you know, it's great to have visitors like you Mr Smith. Yes, thank you Mr Chatfield. That's all that we have time for today. Next week we shall be Do you want a cup of tea yet? Just a minute. Next week we shall be back in presenting our current series on disasters in our Ideas in Action programmes. Until next week then, goodbye. Do you do this every week Mr Smith? Yes we do. Goodbye. Well I must have to try and buy a radio I think. Hiya. It's been a funny week. And loosing somebody as well. Yeah Tiger. Want your bear back? He's always wanting. Cheerio then See you. your bear back still gotta a little bit of chocolate left haven't you? Have you? Don't get cold. Want it on? No. You're gonna carry it? Hi Chris. Hi Been a bit better afternoon.

She like woke up Monday morning, she there was four empty vodka bottles . She was in the cab with the machine . Two telephone boxes you know, next door to each other. The job had just kicked off so the blokes used to just the phone inside you know if they wanted . think that you used to have to buy, didn't have to buy your tea, but you used to buy a tea from the chemist shop and the only person that sold it was a chemist, that was . Which is sold everywhere today, you could only buy it in a chemist shop, tea. Along with tea, that was another brand that the chemist used to sell. was a digestive tea, they called it Digestive Tea in those days. To sell it of course, but erm that was another facet of it. Did you go with your mother then shopping Oh yes, yes. And I could tell you another story as well, I maybe used to pinch an apple out of one of the barrels. But the shop, the store manager knew and it was paid for. Oh I see. You see, he knew. Ah. As a child, I can remember it ever so well, doing it, mm, taking this apple out and and invariably used to have one when I went in. But me mother used to pay for it you see. It was an understood thing, I think the kids used to do this but the parents used to, Use used to pay Used to yes used to put it right yes. He told hadn't he, the manager. But erm those were those those were school days. The school itself as I say I went to er Street School. And er in later days it was called the School. It got rather sort of upgraded. What sort of, what time did you start school, can you remember ? Nine o'clock in the morning , er till twelve. We used to have a lunch break at around about half past ten I think ti was, we used to go out for a quarter of an hour into the school yard to play and have your lunch. You used to take your lunch with you, as sandwiches. Erm I can recall my first day at school. It was a Miss , was the he the teacher. And a Miss was the head mistress. This was the junior school, we went at five. And as I say you took your little wrapped up lunch invariably in newspaper, because they was no such thing as tissue paper int hose days you know, that wasn't hardly available. And erm you used to cut it into the basket in the corner. And What everybody had to put their Everybody yes the name, your name was on written on it you see. Everyone put their lunch into the basket in the corner and in this first class there used to be a a sandpit and I remember we we had very big cards, well I say very big about six inches long by three inches wide. And each one had got different letters of the alphabet ion it and that's how we learnt the alphabet. With these cards. I think there was three or four classes in the primary school. Then you graduated into the sort of the er erm upper school. And you say in in in this class, this is when you first went to school they had a sandpit, this was for playing in ? That's right playing in, the sandpit, that's right a, a sandpit in the corner for playi we kids to play in you see. And er I remember this Miss very well, she was i , skirt down to her ankles sort of thing, black skirt you know and high collar and sort of tied hair, very dark person but she was a very nice charming lady as I recall now. And erm I think you know you you owe quite a lot to your first teachers, quite a lot. And er I I as I say I moved up into the next er school. Can you re remember what sort , oh this was a different school? No, same in the same school, in the same school yes, different different sort of department sort of thing. The primary school was a small school on one side and then we moved over to the boys, and the the boys school was on the top floor and the girls school was on the bottom floor. And we all used to we we both schools ended up, er used to use the same assembly hall. And erm we used to go into the assembly hall every morning for prayer and then we should just go up to the erm we we used to go upstairs to the er to the classrooms which were off a long corridor. There was one long corridor and all the classrooms were were off this corridor you see, I I should think there'd be er five, five classrooms, it was it was no sixth form. Can you remember what sort of s , how many children to a class,? Oh yes I can, about forty or fifty of us to a class. And erm the first class was a Mr erm Mis was a Miss . A Miss , that's right, she took the first class. That was one of the, graduating from the primary to the upper school. And I remember her very well and the next class we went into was a a Mr . Can you remember what sort of lessons you you did ? Oh yes, yes, yes, we did er we did everything, all the the three Rs and everything else. And as we got up into the classes we also had a woodwork er centre, and metal shop there. And we also had a swimming pool about, a small swimming pool. Er only a small one, erm it was real a a learner er swimming pool, but erm the less This was contained in the school grounds? That's right, yes, well it was a school yard, it wasn't, they weren't grounds a as such, it was a yard. An asphalt yard. And erm we erm when you got to about the third class I think you you was allowed to participate int he woodwork and metal er class, you used to go across for half a day a week. And other schools in the area used to use this facility as well as well as we did. And the the pool too. Like from Road at , and er I think I'm not sure whether or didn't use to use it as well. There was quite a few schools used it. Road schools, they used it. Er the woodwork centre as well. A man named was the er principal of that er of the woodwork and metal, I think there were two teachers there two instructors if you'd like to call them that. And what Erm what would you do in this sort of would you make things that you could take home ? Oh we'd make things, make things, that's right, yes,instruction. They taught you how to to saw a piece of wood and how to make a joint, a dovetail joint or a mortice and joint. Er I think I , the height of my erm efforts there was I made a needle box, a needlework box, with all the partitions in and we French polished it and all this sort of thing. And I also made a couple of erm copper ashtrays and and and beat them. And we also did a bit of leather work to, where we used to hammer the the leather and put colours on to it to make purses and that sort of thing. These are things they don't do at school today do they? Not much of them anyway. Not in that class of school. And would these be with the with the idea of teaching you almost like a trade, you know sort ? No no no no no not a trade, just to make you handy. No it was just it was just so you, I mean let's face it, er my father used to mend our shoes, repair our shoes, in fact I've still got his hobbing iron now. You don't know what a hobbing iron is do you? No. It was cast in heavy metal and er it had er sort of a a sole on one e part of it, and a heel on the other part, and then there was a small children's sole. And er you sort of pull the shoe over the sole and er then hit, my father would sort of shape a piece of leather around the sole of the shoe and then er he would sort of tacks that went through, the hobbing iron which was iron of cours tacks that went through, the hobbing iron which was iron of course would bend them over inside your shoe, just like a normal cobbler repairs shoe. Then he'd have a, then when he'd done that he'd have a erm, oh I think they used to call it a a wax ball, er to rub round the end of the sole and have a an iron that he would rub this wax into the seam between your your your shoe itself and the leather to seal that off and make it waterproof. And it all our shoes were repaired on the backyard, like that er he had no shed ad there was no outbuildings were we lived at anyway, and er he'd always sit in the summertime in the backyard repairing shoes. Where wold he get the material for ? He'd buy that from a cobbler's shop, from a shoe repairer's shop. Erm of which were there were many in those days er, not so many today of course but er er ooh I should say there were probably on Vale which was our nearest sort of shopping area to where we lived, there were probably two or three erm shoe repairers, including , and you could go and buy leather there. Get a a small piece, you could buy a I think it was called a side of leather or a whole piece of leather and cut yourselves out of it.And erm leather wasn't cheap even in those days, it varied in thickness. In ladies' shoes it was a thinner leather and the men's shoes it was a thicker leather. That's another thing they used to do in those days they never do now, a lot of men when they bought a pair of boots, they had them what they called plumped. And they'd buy a brand new pair of boots and take them straight round to the shoe repairer and have an extra sole put on, from brand new to make them last longer. You'd see men walking round on their shoes about an inch thick, you see. And the the moment that that sort of sole had worn off that the shoe repairer had put on it wasn't allowed to go any further than that, it was taken off and another one put on. Consequently their sh their their boots lasted them almost a lifetime. And er on your, on the better shoe, like you what we call, might call a Sunday shoe, you'd have a a rubber heel put on, I don't mean just a a complete heel but a round disc that was screwed on to your heel, if I can explain that to you. It's like a a rou round disc that screwed on and as that wore at the back you used to just slacken the screw slightly and turn it round until a little bit more of it wore and then you turn it round again until the whole thing was worn down. Then you replaced that, that was saving your heels. This was for economy's sake you see, you couldn't afford to buy shoes like people buy them now and just throw them away. Er a pair of shoes if you bought it had to last you a long long time. And these were the things that did And the only time you would get a new pair was if the top part of the shoe That's right, if the sho if the top part of the shoe went that was the only you got a new pair or if or if it burst around the sole and the seam. Er there was there was a erm a stud that was called a . Er that was the name of the manufacturer an you used to buy them on cards, they were all sizes and the big one you used to put onto the tips of your your er soles just in on the tips, to save the front of the shoe. And the er if you didn't have your rubber soles which er a lot of people didn't really like, I think most people thought they were a bit effeminate, most men did anyway, and they used to have these little metal tips put on, you see, or a metal sort of cross section across the heel, that was to save your your shoes again. Would would women's shoes have the metal soles ? Oh yes, women, yes they'd have little tips, little put on, but theirs were little tiny ones. Erm we boys, my father used to s what we call stud our shoes, and they were round sort of metal studs, and these were sort of knocked into your soles to save the leather. This was innovation all the time just for economy's sake, you you as I say you you just couldn't afford, although you could buy er a beautiful pair of shoes for twelve and six, that was a lot of money. Where would where would your parents buy your clothes? Would you go into the city to buy ? Oh no, no, no, no, local shops, local shops. I don't think I ever I have ever anything out of the city at all. Er th the main shopping area for us when we li well it was when we, for both places, was . Well Main Street catered for almost everything. There was everything that you particularly could want from a grand piano to a pin sold in Main Street. I mean there were erm draper's stores, there were furniture stores, there were all the butcher's shops, grocer's shops, greengrocer's shops, chemist's shops, ladies' outfitters, hatters, tripe shops, er seed merchants, er bakers, millers, erm I can't say there were wallpaper sop shops and paint shops as such because there wasn't such a thing as a wallpaper shop specializing it usually went to the hardware shop for wallpaper and paint. And paint wasn't as you know it today, there were perhaps three colours in paints, green, brown and cream. Everyone's house, and that's another thing, if you wanted to paint as your house inside, the cupboards and the doors, they were painted brown and that was a lifetime's job, they were never done again, not like you do now with this freshening up of paint every so often. Er wallpapering erm you invariably did that yourself or there were there were paperhangers and decorators about. Erm if I remember correctly the pre-War price for hanging a wall up, a roll of wallpaper was about sixpence a roll, and that included preparing as well. And if you wanted ten rolls of wallpaper they'd paper your room for five shillings. In fact I have a bill somewhere where the next door to me at at the shop on Street was papered from top to bottom and the total bill for the paper and labour I think is under three pounds and that included el e e e eleven rolls for a staircase. So most rooms were papered you didn't leave the walls just painted ? Oh no no no, there was no such, there was there was distemper as it was called, er not like emulsion is today, there was this distemper that was called but er oh no that was that was for the pigsty the distemper was, whitewash. People used to whitewash their ceilings. Erm with whitewash not with er emulsion, that was too expensive, they'd buy a packet of a packet of which would make so many gallons of whitewash and you'd whitewash the ceiling. But er if you had to paper the parlour was always papered in the ceiling but he kitchen was always whitewashed because we had these, if I explain to you these er fireplaces that er weren't very successful burning coal you know and the smoke would rise and before you knew where you were the ceiling was black again so sort of every so often up went the whitewash brush and you'd whitewash the the ceiling. But erm the paintwork was always, inside a house was always brown, like this is, as you can see it's woodwork, it was it was a colour like a chocolaty brown. And er I never remember er my parents painting anything in the house at all. I don't think my father would've known how to use a paint brush anyway. You know what I mean i i it wasn't done, wasn't done. Th th when the house was built it was painted and I think that used to last it's lifetime. Mind you it was paint then it wasn't like it is today, it was sort of good lead paint was put on, and it did last. And that's another thing I mean where erm as I got I mean cleaning was sort of a a spring clean was springtime and that was it. You had a turn out then and I think it lasted till the next spring, not like taking curtains up and down like people do now and hoover for the carpets, course the carpet would be taken out and beaten as you as you know, they weren't they were slung onto a line and beaten with anything that was handy. There was no such thing as a vacuum cleaners or anything like that you know.And er er that's just how it went on. It was an amazing thing really when I when I look back and think about the decoration side of it because, those fireplaces were had to be seen to be believed because they were, if the wind was in the wrong, you we , the room was full of smoke. And the kitchen was just through there and er my mother when she used to bake and cook er the blue smoke would be everywhere and er it must have been terrible when you think about it you know, terrible, it must've been. But er they they managed, they managed, they coped. Just going,you were talking about decorations, with going back to the school, we were talking previously about school, Yeah. h what were your, can you remember excuse me. what the classrooms were like? How were they Oh very vividly. Erm now the the it was it was a it was a mixed school but the girls were all on the, it wasn't a mixed school in the sense of the word there was mixed in classes. There was the the boys section, the girls section, and the juvenile section. Now the juvenile section was on one side of the yard, the school yard. And there was this long building on the er the other side of the er yard. Now the down floor or or the ground floor er th was the girls, and the assembly hall, the big assembly hall, and the boys classrooms were above the girls, you went upstairs, you see onto one wing. And there was a very long corridor with a mo what must have been I should think five, there was no sixth form, so there'd be five classes, five classrooms off this long the hallway perhaps as wide as this room which is what thirteen feet. And er the classrooms were off this with sort of wooden petitions and glass, in the door. And erm the er the first class was right at the very far end of the corridor. That's where you graduated from the junior class as a boy, you'd move up to that first class on this er this long corridor. And each year you moved up whether you were good, bad or indifferent you moved up one class, you see. You were you never stayed in the same class two years. Erm you you came up this that's right class one and then class two, and then class three, class four, class five, that's right, right to the very end. And the headmaster's room was at the very end of that corridor where the fifth class was. Er and we called er his name it was a Mr , we always called him Gaffer , it was never Mr , it was the Gaffer was the headmaster. And er he used to pop in and occasionally take the fifth class, whether it was because it was near to his office I don't know. But erm that was your final one and er that was run by a Mr , I remember Mr because he was also the sports master as well. So each class had mixed ability groups mixed ability Oh yes, yes yes, oh yes, it was just d if you was if you was behind then it was just too bad. Because erm even going back to those days it was the bright ones that were pushed forward and the the sort of dog take the hinder most sort of thing you know. And erm I think I was in the middle somewhere, I wasn't er brilliant but I must have been somewhere in the middle I suppose. I I can't complain, I had a reasonable education there, as to what was available, as to what was available. But erm it was good, the school life was very, very very good because the teachers, they were they were excellent men when I look back and think about it, they really were. And er what I see of the modern teacher I'm probably looking out with three different eyes, they don't seem to come up to the same standing as those men were, at all because one thing that I I remember very vividly about them all, and they were family men, what I call family men. And er I don't know they seemed to be sort of more worldly wide in many respects. Probably weren't I don't know but they seemed to us I may be looking at it from a child's eyes but er that's how they seemed to be to me. I mean er I remember one year we had to we was asked to write an essay or a composition as it was called then, not essay, composition. As to what we were going to do in our school holidays, and if I don't, let's see, the teacher was named , it's be the fourth class, and er two of us decided we were going to, and this was before the days of hiking as such, we decided we were going to go hiking. We didn't call ti hiking we were going on a walk. And we described what we were going to do on this walk and where we were going to go and both sort of referred to the same composition and there was a prize for the for the one that was judged the best. Anyway this boy and I was judged to be the most original and the best you see. And er the prize was a erm a trip into the with a teacher, on his motorbike and sidecar, he'd got a motorbike and sidecar. And er he he wen he took along on this jaunt right out to , into the,he showed us the erm major oak, I can remember it very well. And he came, when we came back again, he brought us along the erm main road back and er and er he we visited er Bridge. Now this was the old wooden toll bridge, before the new bridge was built, I remember that being built in nineteen twenty eight. And erm this was the first time that I'd ever been sort of as far afield into the country as this, and to go and see the erm er Toll Bridge at , that was, and top go over it, because it was a long wooden bridge that used to go over, and er we thought that was absolutely fantastic. That was our prize for writing an essay, but he was a human being, this this teacher, he seemed to be so friendly towards us, you know. Although erm on the other hand I'd plenty of strap, what we call strap you know. Was what form of discipline ? Yes, oh yes. The cane, cane and strap you used to have, the teacher used to give us the strap, the headmaster used to give us the cane. Erm What was the strap, can you describe ? Oh yes, it was a leather er erm a piece of leather with three tongs on it and a handle to it, and er you used to have this strap on your hand. Not your body at all. And er er it varied from one stroke on one hand for a certain thing or one on each hand, up to I've had as many as six strokes of the strap. What what would you have done wrong to get say one strap? One strap? Erm talking. Persistent talking you would get two. In fact I had it six for talking in class, I remember very vividly having six strokes of the strap on my hand. So Oh we used to shake our hands, we didn't use to go home complaining. We didn't report them to the authorities, or anything like, we knew we'd we'd earned them. I had strap many times, I remember once, on my desk, in my desk, they were lift up desks at the time, and it it and it was teacher was a grand fellow , and I got under my desk, underneath my desk, written underneath it, erm God helps them that helps themselves, but God help them that I catch in this desk. And of course we used to have desk infect inspections, of course we used to take that down before a desk inspection you see, this we had a surprise inspection and lifted it up and saw this and read it out, read it , Right, he said, And we'll go God's going to help you do something else, come out . And I had three strokes on each hand for that. So he'd hit you in front of the class ? Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, we used to get punishment in front of class. Now anything really deadly serious that took place then you taken to the headmaster's room and he dealt with it. What were these serious Cane. With a cane. Now being late, the headmaster always dealt with you fro being late, that wasn't a teacher's responsibility at all.You used to have to line up all those boys that were late, you used to have to line up outside the the headmaster's room, one at a time, I I jus on each hand, you used to have a cane on each hand. Never on your backside like you see in the films, that sort of thing, always on your hands, never anywhere else, never got hit your body. Erm After you'd had this erm punishment ere you expected to go back to your lessons straight away, how long did it hurt, did your hands Immediately, of course it hurt. Your hands were red, you used to shake them, and go back straight back to your work. And I never remember any boy ever cry. You didn't cry, nobody showed it like that. And er I think in the junior school, it was in the juniors you didn't get punishment there as children in the first school, you stood in a corner, that was your punishment. Like I I see it done today I think that sort of thing, you used to stand in a corner. But erm oh no we we er we we took it and and that was it, you accepted it. Accepted it. And er another thing that we never did in those school er very very very rarely did a boy erm oh what did we use to call it? When he he he evaded going to school, play truant. He he very rarely played truant a boy didn't it's er in fact I er I don't think I ever did, to my knowledge played truant at all during school. It was a very very rare occasion, er you had to be ill to be off school. You never thought of just taking the day off ? No no no no no no no never. Never even even your last day at school you you didn't take it off. You were there. Why do you think that was? Well I think it was the discipline that you'd got in those days. It just wasn't done. Er school days were school days. You went to school at nine o'clock, you came home at twelve, you went back at two and you came home at half past four. And erm we never thought about playing, I suppose there were odd boys that did this sort of thing but er they were very very rare, very rare. In fact you you the classroom was always full, there were no spare seats at desks or anything like that, and if one was empty you knew something was really radically wrong. Er I think one of the greatest er causes of s absenteeism, it wasn't so much ill health er not on the part of the pupil, I think it was more er if something was wrong within th family, particularly if you was an elder daughter or an elder boy, you see and erm, if your mother was ill or or confined you see, you were probably kept at home er for those sort of reasons to either look after the the younger children at home or to help to to look after home. I mean there was no such things as home helps and and that sort of thing in those days, it was a case of of doing it yourself. And I think where where youngsters were away from school that was a greater reason for them to be at home, to look after home, whilst their parents were ill or if probably one of the other kids were off ill or something like that you see, because in most families there was what three and four children. I mean ours was a comparably small family with two. And erm as I told you before we had, I had two aunts with eleven each. And erm I should say the average family was around about four, four mark, four and five children mark. So what, elder children had res had quite a bit of responsibility ? Oh very much so, very much so. Very much so. Very much so. In fact my own wife, she came of a big family and and she had to look after most of the the younger children until they started work you see and then it was the next one that had to look after them again you see and so on, and that's how it went on. But erm er the school days I think were were really the best days of our lives, but they we were the happiest days anyway because I enjoyed them and most kids enjoyed school in those days, not like it is today. And er we had some marvellous school parties. Erm when I say parties that's probably not the right word because erm party indicates sort of food and games, we had concerts and we used to put on these concerts, the pupils used to put them on ourselves and our parents were invited to come and watch these concerts. What at Christmas time ? No no no, that was a special one. Er the Christmas party, that was always a special party. The whole of the school would join in that, boys and girls were together, they were se segregated in the hall you didn't sit next to a girl or anything like that, the boys were on one side, the girls were on the other side. But the the Christmas party was something out of this world. You used to have to take a er a erm your own cup and erm that was for your for for whatever we had we I don't know I remember we had lemonade or pop or whether it was tea or we had er we had to take a cup, and er most of us invariably took a a big handkerchief with us. Now you might ask what the big handkerchief was for. And I assure you it wasn't to wipe your nose, it was to bring home any surplus cakes, that were left on the table. And you were you were invited to take those home and they used to say, Put them into your big handkerchief and wrap them up. Erm either for the younger children that were at home or your parents to eat. And er nearly every boy used to take a handkerchief along with him to the, that was to the Christmas party because that was the only party you had a meal at school. And er as I say we had a concert after this but th th I can't remember whether they were professionals or whether any good amateur people. But we had some fantastic concerts, we had a stage at the end of the assembly hall, and they used to put on this erm concert for us, singing, dancing and the piano, I remember that very well, the piano. And er it would you would have tea at about er half past three, and probably the concert'd start at about half past, about five o'clock, half past. And we should come away about sort of seven o'clock in the evening, it didn't go on till late at night, you know, like some of them do now. You'd go with your parents? No, no, on your own, no no your parents weren't allowed to that one, that was that was children's party. That was a it was a party. And er the trestles and the tables were all laid down the assembly hall and then we had a er er after the erm when you had your your meal, which consisted of sandwiches and cake, that was all. It wasn't a knife and fork effort at all. And er we'd have to clear all those away, and the chairs would be put into rows as I say, the boys'd sit down one side, the girls would sit down the other. And the junior school would sit on the floor in the front and that's how it used to be arranged. That was every Christmas there was a party of some sort put on for us at school. But erm Mr was, he was the headmaster, he was another great character, a great fellow, he was a very big, he was a tall man, about, well over six foot high. I mean I can't remember really but I should say he'd probably be about six foot two or three. He always used to wear a bowler hat and very dark clothes. And er he'd only got to sort of look at you and er that was it. With him. But the discipline was at school w it was when I look back it was marvellous, we we were never really bad lads. We got up to mischief obviously like a lot more, youngsters do even today, but er there was none of this sort of vandalism, we didn't use to destroy anything. Erm if we broke a window it was accidental. I mean I walk around the town and I see a factory or a shop or a house, it only got to be empty about a week and all the windows are smashed. We did nothing like that. We broke windows accidentally, we were throwing erm in fact I was only talking about whip and top the other day, and erm er which was a a game we used to play . And there was the erm there was a top called the window breaker, and it was a special top that had got a long stem on it and a big round like a mushroom, it was like a mushroom almost. And erm these things used to used to sort of wind the r the the the spring or the leather thong around th top and start it off to spinning you know and then you'd keep whipping it like that and you could make these things jump into the air, in fact a friend of mine was telling me, we were talking about it the other day. He said, He saw one boy hit one of these tops and it went straight over a house top. So high. Now these things used to break windows obviously, you can imagine it can't you? And that's why they were called a window breaker these tops. And it you broke a window you had to pay for it. Or your parents did. There was none of this running away and, I haven't done it, and this that and the other. You had to accept the responsibility if you broke the window and your parents used to settle up for you. You got a good hiding for it but but that was it. You you you used to break windows but it wasn't done like you see now people, kids s picking up bricks and just breaking a window for the sheer delight of it. And that wasn't done. Erm but erm we we've gone through the games haven't we the marbles and that sort of thing we we played that Can I talk about your erm school holidays, what Ah. say the summer holiday what what would you as children have done in That your school holiday? Well Easter er and er Whitsuntide wasn't a holiday, Easter was a holiday. Now Easter was taken up with the sort of playing in the streets virtually. Er whip and top and marbles and all those sort of things we used to do. Come the summer holiday which was August Bank holiday, for this I think we were away from school a month. Now er first few days you'd be feeling your feet of course, you'd be playing all sorts of things, you know being free, er in the street, and all this sort of thing. And erm er where we lived it was adjacent to what I call Well. Now as a as it as it's pronounced there, is the town, but this was called Well. Now this was a li a piece of common land adjacent to Cottages, which was on the sort of the north side of . And er there was a a sort of a a cliff, a sandstone cliff, and er out of this cliff side Sounds of the seventies Bit depleted today. Alright, it's alright Hey th they'll be here. top minutes you got there Peter. Th they're blacker than black I had a lot of trouble with the photocopier, right.

Number two, I sent off a letter saying about people not coming and er Wentworth haven't sent a I dunno. Oh. Er shall we affiliate to the Christian Union. I haven't been able to get any tickets for the Word as yet. Er bookings, that's been sorted out. Gossip scandal, Vanbrugh bop is being heavily restricted. Er but in actual fact, it's like a major thing here, but he did very well. Would you like to make a small report on that, Mr Vanbrugh? Er yeah erm the smoke machine thing we got away with now, we went to see them. And er use our smoke machine as long as the porters can see how many are in the bop. Long as the porters can see their own hands . Erm yeah. Basically, yeah. It went okay went down to four hundred people in the whole area instead of five, but apart from that. The, the bloke, the health and safety man said it was all okay. Well, Except for the will, will your take actually increase for four hundred? No, cos before that You were you always could get away five you were allowed five . So y your limit has now been set at five? Yeah. Okay. Erm yeah we can take things into the hall as well now. Hurray. Oh excellent. Very well done. Thanks very much. So sort of general appreciation to Vanbrugh for having their act together. Yeah. I think they deserve an Round of applause. Right. Any other business? Right the quiet period I have some dates for the quiet period. Ooh er. Why? Pardon? Dates . Do you wish to What like dried up, dried grapes prunes that are no longer in top condition. Okay, so if you're all gonna make a note of this right. by the way. The quiet period starts on the eighteenth of May and it goes right through until the twenty first of June. Right er okay that's the quiet period. Er Alcuin want twenty fifth anniversary but nothing's come about that has it John? No. What's that? About the Alcuin twenty fifth anniversary even though it's now now No, no, no the twenty sixth. No. All the J C Rs are represented so we can't fine them. Shame. . Right has anyone got anything they want raising from that list? No. Frank. Number two, electrical safety. I've had a letter and er there's various lists of people you might all have got one eventually, I don't know, but it's from the university engineer. And it's about the free electrical checks for electrical gear. And it says the remaining dates for the free inspection and testing of equipment have been cancelled. With all due respect to those who intended to avail themselves of the free offer, the first two appointments were not met with sufficient organization to permit cost-effective equipment testing. My staff were faced with untidy heaps of apparatus apparatus in equipment rooms, and received little or no help from the student representatives So and then it sort of flabbers on a bit saying they're not happy. I do hope that positive arrangements are made to contact me in writing and that we can continue to work together to provide safe working conditions. Please accept my apologies if you're already working towards this arrangement of the new cancelled dates . So that's a bit poor there, I feel. So Yeah that's very poor. Maybe so Who's er which colleges? He hasn't, he hasn't named colleges. Well I'm going to our own the timetable Simon. If the first two weren't very good, and we've got a copy of the timetable We could we could deduce them if they don't own up. I dunno. It's just I imagine it was Derwent, I mean It mightn't have been Derwent. Yeah, well like please do take this seriously because it's, it's quite important as regards to insurance and having As Vanbrugh proved last weekend,y we can do a good job with your stuff put together, and if like someone got fried, then you may end up in trouble. And they wouldn't be happy. personal. The electrical man from Langwith. Stevie cos he tried to fry himself the other week Yeah. If you're, you're plugging in and it sparks, four way adaptor. don't touch it. Right, so I just feel I'd read that out, so please try and work with the admin, cos we don't want to upset them. Cos it's a pain. I imagine so . Right. Er number three I had a phone call, oh I forgot the term planner. Never mind. I have seen it though, it should be good. I had a phone call last er yeah Tu Monday night from Warwick University who were organizing a conference at the Youth Hostel Association in York. Friday, Saturday and Sunday, week nine. They're like, obviously that's like the first weekend of the holidays, and they wanted to book the P A and some stage blocks. And I suggested charging them like sixty pounds for the three nights. Because with it being What, per night? Well, he was on a, aye he was going on oh how I hate what a band. Never mind about the Hank Wangford Band. Er but I said I couldn't give him a definite quote for a price, because I wouldn't have the Committee. Now normally like three nights would be a sort of Off campus. Off campus. We'll be getting two hundred Two hundred quid. pound. Plus Is this the full P A though or is it just the speaking P A? He wants the speaking P A and stage blocks. Oh that's it. So I think about a hundred and fifty pounds Right. for the er Can like th the late arrivals make sure you put your names on Yeah, I've got my name down. Sorry, I only just woke up. Both. Both. Did you sign both? Yeah. Okay. woman might want to slap her name down. So with it being another student union and it being like a conference in aid of the homeless and that, I didn't really want to sort of give them a load of grief so I suggested about sixty pounds. Er does anyone have any comments on this, with it being money for Ents in general? Well, it's money we wouldn't get otherwise isn't it? It's money you wouldn't get cos it's in the sort of holidays. Erm are they going to pick it up and set it up Does it involve us doing anything? No, no . Er well Tony's going to deliver it and pick it up on the Monday. Oh that's all right. And I said he'd have to pay extra for the minibus hire. T to shift the gear, cos he wants a couple And obviously, they'll have to still give the deposit. Yes. Yeah. But he's still not sure. When he, but then he said, like he said is there anywhere else where he could get a stage from and I explained to him that people come and hire the stage off us like Saint Michael-le-Belfry church, who are paying in cash. So I don't know I just think it's an extra little booking that we shouldn't really turn down cos it's money we wouldn't normally get. Warwick University's really nice. I've been there. It's great. But it's not in Warwick though is it? It's south of it. The the booking isn't in Warwick is it? No. No. in York. Right er number four er the National Entertainments Conference organized by the N U S. I have since secured some money from Executive Committee to send two representatives to this Committee, and it's in the last week of the summer holidays. I was sort of hoping any other people who were interested in standing for re-election might have came along to this Committee to show their Support. support, and interest in entertainments, but obviously they've not turned up. Ah Mm mm. Interesting. Mm. Er so it's at the remit of this Committee to decide who can go to the conference. Er Exec was saying it was probably me and somebody else or would the Committee like to wait and see who's elected tomorrow, and then decide next week? Like cos they said it's up to the Committee as a whole. Is that not at the same time as Glastonbury and all that? Oh wow. Gla Glastonbury's the first week. I'll tell you the dates of it. It's er it's in the Easter holiday. How are you getting down? The sixteenth of between the sixteenth to the eighteenth of April. Eh? Oh. Fair enough. When's Glastonbury this year? June. Er it's the twenty sixth of June. Yeah it seems a bit early though. Yeah so do you want to sort of make a decision now, or wait till next week or Where is it? It's in Oxford Brookes University, which is probably Oxford Poly It used to be Oxford Poly, yeah. I know someone who went there. Fifty pounds plus VAT plus travelling and then you sort of tick in er various boxes if you're a vegan or er Yeah. whatever at the moment. Well Sort it out then. if you're a vegan really. What is it? What do you do? I don't know, I've never been to one before. But it's like basically a conference where all the record company reps and that turn up and try to get bookings for their bands. Isn't that about the P A as well? No, that's a different thing. No, that's not . Could erm Aha. Reaction's over. Julia's reaction's now been completed. It's finished, yeah. Excellent. You've got to I don't know if it's excellent but Ah. You've got to sign a thingy. You've got two things to sign Julia cos we're being ethnographically studied. Right so has anybody got any sort of strong opinions about who should go? Or Who wants to go? Well I said I would go, but I might have been like un-elected Deposed. tomorrow. In which case I won't have a Leg to stand on. post on this Committee. Except Tony says I can return to being Security manager. Yeah. Quite correctly You haven't done it! I've had nothing to do! And I've done it very well. Ah sure. Right, I'll sort Nobody's got a sort of decision on Oh is it? that? Look do w Right. Does anyone want to go? Does anybody like, do you want to go? Want a free weekend out? In Oxford. In Oxford. Yeah, well Right, well, me and Andy will go then. That'll be a laugh. No, I'm busy. I'm washing my hair,me hair. Yeah, but will you get to meet all high-flyer record company executives. Yeah you're bound t you're bound to get on the telly then, man. It'll help your quest for stardom. Yeah. a bit odd though, it's a bit pointless, as Look I'm not going to be here next year. Barry White might be there. Never mind about Barry White. Right, number, we'll come back to that next week, number five the post van. On my way back from Ents Committee last week, erm the internal mail bloke was delivering some gear to computer services, and he left the back of the post van open. And there was a stage board in the back and when I said , what's that doing in there? He said oh we use them as ramps. heavy gear. And I'm a bit distressed at this, cos they're not designed for That's ten quid a time isn't it? Aye I think we Ten quid a day. I think we ought to er And write to them there was a lot of trouble early on this term when people couldn't find stage boards, and like they were all missing and it turns out that they're like the The university have claimed one. At least one. At least one. Well, probably one for each van. But like probably one for each van yeah. So, there are, does this Committee think that I should like write them a letter saying Definitely. either we want like a lot of money, No, I think we want Yeah. a lot of money. Tell them that we want we wanna be paid for them, and erm all we want Yeah, every day is ten pounds a day sort of thing. Yeah and, and Back pay. and we either want them back or we want, or we want money to buy some new ones in addition. Yeah, because the ones that we've did cost like I think it was Eight hundred ei pounds. e eight hundred pounds for twelve, so that's seventy pounds each. Sheesh That's loads. They were a lot of money. So They look really crap as well. Yes . You can either stand on them, or look very stupid on the stage. So, right, well I shall write to them, and tell them that it's very naughty. Cos I I am not ha not amused. Okay. They should send a representative to Committee for grilling. Aye. Head, head of postmen? Head of internal mail come. Right, any other business. Has anybody got any Well other business? bookings. We got bookings. Well I haven't done bookings. But I'll, I'll put that into . Right Ah, Julia's got something that's quite important, that's annoying her, about Derwent dining hall. Which, which oh, that bit. Erm Derwent? Give us, give us the tale Julia. Okay, the, the tale is that in January I booked Derwent dining hall for a barn dance next week and got a phone call yesterday but I wasn't there and she rang back this morning,said oh I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but you can't have it, I'm very sorry . On and on. So I said you know we've got P and P out, we've started selling tickets. Erm we haven't bothered to book a stage because Derwent has one, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And then later on, oh and then she was going to see room bookings and try to find me another dining hall cos I said it's pretty late notice, and she said oh no, it's a week and I thought well I had booked it two months ago. well, it's a week for both of you. Not just a week for you. Well that's it. What she'd had was a double-booking, effectively, cos she'd had this dinner which was meant to be in the private dining hall, but the numbers had suddenly shot up, and because they'd said originally they wanted either the private dining hall or the main dining hall depending on numbers, she should have really booked them both and decided later and told me to like try somewhere else, but she didn't, she told me yeah the dining hall's free. Off you go sort of thing. Erm but then she rang back later, I don't know whether she contacted room bookings to try and get me a dining hall, but she said they might be able to have their dinner in the S C R. So that's alright, I'm okay. If not has any one booked the for next Wednesday night? I don't want to book them now, but I'd just like to know. I don't think so, no. Right, I'll leave it for now. Can I just say, this has shades of the Kingmaker fiasco? Yeah, yeah. Yes, it's like just walk all over the students again. Erm For, for like It's her mistake, it's not the fault of the other people not booking, cos they had said they might want the main dining hall. No but they're still giving, yeah but the priority But it's and, yeah. Yeah. For tho for those that, for those that missed that er, last year Alcuin J C R booked Kingmaker as part of their massive big mega-media global world tour. And then a fortnight before the end of the, the summer holidays they were told they couldn't have the dining hall because the day after the Freemasons were having their That was the day after. And it wasn't even the same day, but the day after, and as a result, er a man called John , Who we don't like. Who we don't like. Er And who's descended from the . Is he? Gosh. ? Yeah. Oh there you are. Yeah, anyway, he comes That's amazing. from Gladstone and Gannon, and er he gave an awful lot of people at the S U and at Alcuin J C R a lot of grief over the provost, who then wrote them a letter saying I, Jim am the fault of all this and just generally made the students look even dafter for As though they just couldn't organize . They just couldn't organize anything and as a result that's why we'll probably never get Kingmaker or the Ned's Atomic Dustbin. Or anybody else from Gladstone and Gannon. Anyone else from Gladstone and Gannon. So We don't need them. There's not a lot we can actually do. Apart from, did you get your room booking form back? Yeah, I've had it confirmed by room bookings. Oh, I'll have to see wh she's going to ring me this afternoon and say whether they can do it in the S C R. I'm gonna try and persuade her that they can, because there are only forty people at this dinner and they'll look stupid in the middle of the dining hall. Mm. We could dance round them, there'd be enough space, you know. Well offer the, offer the forty people reduced tickets for the can't go on no, wow, wow, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom . What? he get's down on his Microphone when we start singing. Go on break the . We don't need nothing Oh, what we need is Richard over here to give us some of his crazy comments, yeah. never came over today did he?. Do you wanna tell me what number it is? .
