sort of use the Marxist model and apply it to China and what the Com Well you should be able to. Chinese Communist Party was doing, well why should you? Yeah so that's the classic claim of Marx's model innit? It's like the theory of history. You should be able to Well maybe the Communist Party realized that it wouldn't work. Why are they a communist party then? I mean But is, is, is is it possible that it is actually very useful to have classes, to, to have inequalities? I E Well yeah I there, there, there is, I'm not saying that this and er and I do see what you're saying, yeah. I E In what way? In the political sense in that how , yeah. Yes politically. I i in terms of mobilization, in terms of, of revolutionary struggle, in terms of revolutionary progress. Er it, it does seem to me it would've been an enormous problem for the Chinese Communist Party had absolute egalitarianism worked. It would have left them with, with no mechanism to go forward. They actually had a vested interest in having inequality within the coun er er because it, it retained classes and therefore potential class conflict within the countryside and therefore it offered a way forward to socialism. But isn't it sort of very much an view, you know this that this is the theory for justification for the, their policy or was it theoretical erm ? Er production. Yes. Erm well e e I, I quite agree. Absolutely. Erm but one, one one, I mean cl clearly the policy which was pursued was one of inequality and there was a rich peasant economy and either you say well yes there is, there is an economic imperative for that and that's the explanation or you say well there might have been a political factor involved in this that there was a recognition that progress was going to come through class conflict and therefore if you are actually promoting the kind of you might realize it was happening and you might be more prepared to Mm. Because you would be saying well if we have classes this provides us with a way forward for the future in a way that if we have absolute egalitarianism that, how would we make progress through to socialism? But why did they go for absolute egalitarianism in the first place then? Was it just so that they could, for political means again to get peasant support? Erm, yes. Yes if, if you go back forty six forty eight that was it. So you're saying that they were driven more by there political desire for power than by their ideology because had absolute egalitarianism worked then they should have been satisfied with that because then they were fulfilling their ideology. Yes. But it obviously hasn't worked. No but you were saying before that had it worked it would've given them a problem. The way I It would've done. I see it is that had it worked it would have fulfilled their ideology. It would have fulfilled their ideological aims. Why is that? W w w cos, cos one aim is equality, the other aim is socialism. Mm. But don't you get equality through socialism? Isn't that the aim? Yes. Rather than equality Absolutely, yes. And they're also looking for progress too, they want to increase Right. everybody's S s so we're looking for, in a sense, for three things, one is is er paving the way for industrialization, one is equality, one is the ideological movement to socialism and somehow you've got to allow for all of those three. And I think in a way absolute equality would've provided a problem in terms of both paving the way for industrialization because you would have created a subsistence economy and that would not have helped anybody. Secondly I think it would actually have created problems in terms of ideology. This whole idea of a subsistence economy is something I'm not really, I'm not really sure about it because erm what, what would exactly, you're saying that if everybody was the same then erm then you're somehow necessarily going to be producing at a subsistence level so erm so er and so it's, so if you can only extract surplus by effectively taking it off something given to others. Yes. So you're virtually condemning some people to operate below subsistence Yes. in order to allow other people to extract a surplus which you then give Yes. Yes. Right. So why, why, why can't you just erm why can't they just take a bit off everybody in that case and, and inflict the same degree ? Cos you're inflicting, you're inflicting or, or people at the very bottom of the scale, you're forced to operate below a level of subsistence because inequalities. Yes. So why don't you just run a middle peasant economy but take what you need from everybody else? But surely state intervention should have been the best way of achieving both goals? But how could the, the s By taxing people. how, how would the state have the means to intervene? Just go give us your taxes, build a few factories. Where are they gonna get these, how can they impose taxes unless there's some kind of a healthy economy? You know an economy that's Well I mean collapsing and is in such a state. there is, no, cos there's a surplus right? But there's There will, I mean but, but would there? I mean is, Yes but how great is this surplus? Well look there's a finite amount of resource in the economy. You've got some rich people, you've got some poor people. Yeah right. Right? Now there's gonna be a surplus no matter who you give it to, no matter where, I mean Why? Why? That surplus probably has Because those people on subsistence level are surviving right, and if they're surviving Yeah. it means that they're there and that if you take something away from the wealthy peasants and equalize Yeah. amongst your old'uns, whatever but it is gonna be But isn't there a, a different expenditure pattern between the rich and the poor? That Yeah yeah but erm what I'm saying is you can tax them take that surplus, cream it off, create an equal society direct state intervention invest it in factories, whatever. Right. I don't think it'll really help, I mean No. But, but i i i i if you went yes I mean er in a sense that th there are one possibility is to redistribute the land, and do that equally, but if, if there, there was not enough land to bring everybody up to subsistence level er I mean some were, the, the argument is there wasn't enough land to bring everybody up to a landlord's subsistence level. Or at best everybody could just come up to but nobody would be creating re er a surplus, nobody would have the resources to invest to enable them to come above subsistence Yes. and if you then taxed you would, you would pushing everybody down below. Right. And tha that is no way then that is no way forward. What I'm Yeah. Yeah but as far as I can see there either is a surplus or there isn't, you know, that it shouldn't depend on where you organize the a aggregate. Why not? If y the way, if you Because any sur any surplus you're extracting from rich peasants is an artificial one because it's only based on, you know, basically imposed suffering of poor peasants. You're not allowing Bu but, but the rich because they have more resources are more highly productive. So they have a higher income. Yes. Which you can then tax. And you will be able to,y y you, your tax revenue will rise because you've got a group that is rich. And then but also with the poor peasants I mean you, you've given them a, enough land so that they, they still can't meet subsistence, given them some land but not enough, but you know because they're resourceful and they've got other things that they, they don't need to have enough land to give subsistence, they'd rather go and do something else and make it up. So that therefore in, I mean it's like a form they just they just get by. Yeah but I, but I cos I can see the arguments but then I mean I'm just not, I'm not entirely sure whether i i it couldn't work, that it couldn't work being a middle peasant economy and that these erm these inequalities would er sort of Y y y you could certainly extract a sur er extract a surplus for the government Yeah. which the government would then have spent on the industrial sector so agriculture would not have moved forward. And no middle peasant would have then had the investment resources to improve his own I E the, the agricultural sector would, would not be left with enough resources to improve. And Why do say that? I mean why, er with this surplus they've gathered, I mean what you're saying is that the rich peasant economy effectively are better investors Yes. they're more productive Yes. but that needn't be the case. I mean if the government is er taxing and pr channelled that money properly then it should be able to do the job of private investors so surely the arguments hinge upon the fact that perhaps the government is likely to be inefficient, corrupt, bureaucratic, whatever. Possibly but i i if, if you say it is a,i it's an honest government and er er the tax collection is, is straightforward and honest, the government is then deciding what it does with that tax revenue. I, I E you, you're saying in effect that the government is taking all of the surplus from the, from agriculture? Yeah. What little surplus, what little Yeah that's what I'm sa surplus there is, and then it redistributes that surplus and given that the, the, the priority is industrialization most if not all of that surplus is going to go to the industrial sector. There will be no resources for the agricultural sector and agriculture probably will not be able to support the industrialization process. Whereas if you go for a degree of inequality within the countryside, A you will have, you might get the same, same tax yield because you, you have a higher rate of tax on the rich and their revenue's going up so that tax revenue will increase Mhm. and you've got a group, the rich within the agricultural sector who are going to invest and they are more likely to invest in agriculture. You have the problem of how much to tax because on the one hand you're trying to promote this rich peasant economy and not erm tax them too heavily because you don't want to, them to not invest with Yes. and then you also need to have a surplus so that you can erm pay for industrialization, and you can't tax, tax the poor too much to fit into your ideology so at the end of the day, you know, well it's a matter of just balancing all these factors Exactly. Exactly. to get a compromise. Right. So the creation of a rich er along these lines of the creation of a rich peasant economy is a necessity as the Communist Party see it in terms of paving the way for industrialization. It is a better strategy to create resources for industrialization to go for a rich peasant economy than to go for a middle peasant economy. What I'm also saying is that, that in terms of sort of the context of ideology that, you know, from a Marxist perspective it is actually useful still to have rich and poor peasants because potentially you've got classes, you've got class conflict and you've got a means of making further progress towards socialism. And the two come together. Wh what you're also saying is, is right though, that within that the danger is that inequalities get too great and you would also need a set of policies which would stop that inequality. So you're trying to promote it, but you're trying to limit it. And what, well how do you do that, I mean if Right. that is totally inconsistent, if you're trying to create class struggle Right. then you're not gonna stop it, I mean if there's class struggle no one can stop it. Yes. Yes. That, that's gonna be a problem. that political argument seems, I mean you can't win in this game can you? If you've got inequalities and everything then you say ah yes, it's all very good, we need this, the Marxist class struggle, I mean that just seems like a ridiculous argument to me. But w was it, was it the size of China that made this necessary? You know the sort of uncontrollable nature of, of most of it that, that meant they had to get on with it. I'm not sure size is, is the reason. I still don't see why, why you're saying the government couldn't use their erm policies, fiscal policies with erm and then actually take an active part in the economy. Why couldn't they create, improve the agricultural sector by I'm not saying, they, they could have done. Right, but they didn't. Cos the various things you've been saying about the rich peasant economy, I mean Because, but you don't you, you well if you've got a rich peasant economy you don't need to because you're saying the rich peasant Yeah. can do it themselves. But, but it's highly, I mean I don't, it doesn't follow to me that that in any way is compliant with Marxist ideology because surely you want to get to your socialist state Right. Mm. as quickly as possible. Yes. So if you could create equality this er government intervention policy, you'd've achieved your goal. Erm right. And I don't see see why Yes, yes. they couldn't've invested in, in agriculture Sh sh all this in the private sector would've sure,th th th that is your other option is, is that you go for a m a much more equal policy and the, the government takes money in taxation and puts it back into the, the agricultural sector. Right. I think the reason they probably did this because it's, it's, it was politically harder to do that, they would've had to taken a lot more responsibility. Yeah th that was, that was the that was my point about the size of the country, and I think Oh right. Yes. that so,th that sort of policy would be very, would've been difficult you'd have to have a huge sort of bureaucratic structure Yes. to invest in . Right. So, so sort of technically, politically that would have been quite difficult to do because of the manpower involved etcetera Yeah. etcetera etcetera, yes. Whereas creating a rich peasant economy will work immediately cos that's what a significant number of people in, in the countryside will actually go along with and want. Mm. Because it is, it is en it is encouraging people to become rich and basically people want to become rich. But it seems to me like it's passing the buck a bit in the way they're just sort of taking responsibility Yes. Yes. and saying well you know that if we, if the sort of rich peasants were Mm. Yeah. gonna be pretty safe, it's gonna be pretty stable, we don't have to get our f hands dirty erm you know future cos if it doesn't work you can always economic about Taiwan and there's a great deal of irony in this because you know here you are in the nineteen fifties in China rich peasant economy which is accepting and preserving inequalities Yeah. and yet you go to Taiwan and there's some sort of,land reform which ends up in, in a very equal distribution Well exactly what's happening. A and erm and I think it is being conducted by the government which has just left China Yeah, that's right. Yes. Right. This,bu but isn't that only because of what they learnt from Oh absolutely yes. their experience of China? But if erm, if they have learned that why, you know, why didn't the communists? Perhaps they So which is always are you saying that they actually deliberately were trying to Right. Erm right. Zoe would you like to, to carry on from wherever you want see, see what you have. Alright. What then were the economic effects of land reform and the preservation of the rich peasant economy and how successful was it in raising productivity? Land reform had profound impact on the distribution of rural wealth and income and through this on both the motivation and complicity of the rural population to invest, improve farming techniques and to increase production. The degree of the immediate impact of land reform however is a matter of debate. The spef specific impact of land reform is extremely difficult to evaluate. Land reform does not necessarily lead to an immediate rise in output, neither does it increase a physical supply of land, nor does it significantly alter the ratio of peasants for the amount of land available. Furthermore the exact economic impact of land distribution is difficult to identify in test because output is the function of many other factors besides land distribution per se. The scope of the economic analysis of the immediate impact of the land reform period is further limited by lack of statistics. Official economic data released prior to nineteen fifty two were confusing due to lack of standardization, contents and coverage of data. According to one, data especially on output for the immediate post land reform period were later corrected and adjusted by officials causing one to question its credibility. In addition statistical data from the pre land reform period is patchy. Most historians use Buck's land survey data and statistics erm work by the for the nineteen thirties to draw comparisons with official data which was collected for tax purposes from nineteen fifty two onwards but there's very little data from the period of land reform itself. In view of these factors my discussion can be confined to three inter-related aspects of the economic impact of land reform. Since the agrarian reform swept away the landlord tenant relationship it altered the claims to the output from land. These effects will be explored first. As a consequence of the abolition of the landlord tenant structure, reform to the tax structure was necessary. The second aspect considered here will be how the C C P structured their tax system as a means of both investment in industry and as an incentive to agricultural productivity. Finally an assessment will be made as to the effect of redistribution of land reform to agricultural productivity. So what was the overall effect of rent transfer, of agricultural output as a result of the abolition of rent landlords?estimates that the rental land was thirty three percent of the total land area in ninetee in nineteen thirty and about thirteen percent of the total value of agricultural output was transferred amongst households as rent before land reform. Land reform primarily meant the diversion of rent payments. In addition to the redistribution of the actual rent payments the abolition of landlords meant the abolition of other charges, local taxes and surta cha surtaxes, rent deposits and interest payments to landlords. All of these further contributed to the post land reform potential o of the law set to maintain and increase its income, or for the Communist Party to tax. I'll now consider how much the peasants actually benefited from these gains and how much they paid in tax after land reform. Prior to land reform most agricultural taxes were levied to the land itself, assessment per unit of land being graduated according to the quality of land proportional to output. Land taxes were paid to the ? and provisional governments. Tax evasion and tax was widespread. maintains that the actual sums collected by these agents were sometimes as much as ten times what the government received. She explains that there were generally two stages to changes in the tax system, the tax system initiated by the Communist Party. There was expansion of the tax based levied on production per household assessed on the basis of nominal annual y yield. This was the harvest that could be reasonably be expected in an average year. The levy was set by cadres based in . Tax rates were applicable to the total household income derived from agricultural production divided by the number of members in the household who depended primarily on agricultural production. Commercial income was tax exempt. During this first stage tax rates were steeply progressive from three percent on a hundred and fifty per capita per annum to forty two percent. The C C P's aim was to gain peasant support for land reform and to emphasise class divisions. Once land reform was under way, the peasant support of the C C P regime was more secure, the C C P implemented a second stage of its tax programme in the newly liberated areas. From nineteen fifty one to fifty two it re-graduated the progressive tax rates, raising the bottom rate from six percent in the same threshold of a hundred and fifty per capita per annum, and lowering the top rate to twenty five percent. The main incentives to agricultural production embodied in the tax system First production over and above the nominal family unit was free of tax. Following from this there was thus an incentive for peasants to invest in large scale improvements without fear of tax on rises in productivity because the N A Y was fixed for at least three years. Further, because the N A Y was based on grain as a standard, this encouraged a switch to cash crops which were of a higher value relative to grain. The tax system extensively encouraged all peasant owners to settle down and get rich because the tax rate remained fixed on grain output from each household but the adjustment of the tax rate was more advantageous to the rich peasant than the poor, especially in view of the fact that the rich peasant still owned proportionately more land than the poor peasant. According to it did not seem to make much difference to tax on income differentials, rich peasants were still about two and a half times better off than poor peasants. It appeared however that the Chinese Communist Party was rational in its tax policy, taxation was crucial to the C C P to control inflation and the supply of grain to the People's Liberation Army and the population as a whole. estimates that in nineteen fifty the tax amounted to nearly forty two percent of the national budget receipt which was clearly a significant contribution. Turning to the economic impact of land reform on productivity Can I just, can I just stop you there for a minute. To ju and just take taxation bit of it. Do you understand what Zoe is, is talking about? Do, do you understand what the tax system is? No. No. Right. Actually you're okay, it was extremely clear but it, it's a, I think it's a complicated issue. Mm. Is, is what you're saying that, that the tax was on a, a kind of expected yield that cadres would, would, would go into a village and they would say look erm that is the normal yield for that bit of land. On, on, on past experience that's roughly what the yield has been, on an average year you would expect to get that. And, and we are going to base our taxes on that normal yield. if the yield is above that, we're gonna keep the tax base the same, so i if, if your yield goes up, if you work harder, if you're more productive you, you're going to be much better off. We, we will not raise the taxes because your increment's gone up. So, so there's that, there's that kind of incentive behind it and, and, and, and that normal yield is, is gonna operate for three years, if there are improvements we're still gonna keep that the normal yield tax based exactly the same. So there are significant incentives to improve the land. So what happens after three years, the er the yields are sort of therefore reviewed and the reassessed? Yes. How would they do that? So basically what you, you, what you would be likely to do is rip o rip off the system completely for two years at a time Yes, but then er you face the possibility that er because your, your, if you like, your normal yield has risen Yeah, that's it. you will move into a different sort of tax bracket. it's a strange incentives aren't there? It's like in the first year the first year of the three year period you've got an incentive, Yes. the second year you increase about as much but the third year you're gonna bring it right down use hardly anything at all. Yeah but the point is did they actually have to claim how much, I mean er you know they produced, cos all we're saying here is they're just taking a a nominal amount which they stipulate at the beginning of a three year period, and they're just gonna take that. I mean they're not gonna have any information of how much you've produced over and above your tax. So how do they follow But er but at the same time I mean how do they go about reclassifying Ah. That's, that's going to be a problem but that's, that's three years off. And presumably No but by that time you've got the personnel and you've Oh I see. you've got much more information and, and, and you would But er what information? I don't see Well presumably would go back in the village and if you asked other villagers look how much has X grown on that bit of land they will tell you. Tax erm I can't remember where it was that, I think it might have been one of you saying that how that a peasant of subsistence level erm would still have to pay eighteen percent of its income Right. in taxation but that still the peasant was, even though this might seem like quite a bit, the peasant was still in a better position than he had been previous because rents were at least thirty percent. Yes. Yes. So it's a matter of ho I mean er greater equality was achieved, but they could've erm I mean a hundred and fifty was a very low threshold okay let's just work around that. What, what you're saying is that I mean broadly this is, is quite an incentive based system, at least on the face of it Mm. er in, in that you, you are, you, you're sort of fixing your taxes and then you're allowing, anybody who increases their output will keep, will benefit from that. So, so basically it's an incentive system for, to increase production. And it, it's clear that, that production was higher than, than normal expectation so it seems to have had a positive effect in terms of. And you're also saying that, that there is some equalization going on because erm the tax rate erm and th th th the top tax rate, at least to begin with, is forty two percent, the bottom tax rate is only three percent. So there's, there's an equalization going on. But what you're then saying is that the taxes start at a very low threshold I E you, you, you start to pay tax at a hundred and fifty Cantonese per person. about eight hundred for subsistence. Exactly. So you are taxing peasants at well below subsistence level. Now either, either we have,ei either you accept that and y y you're saying n not only in terms of land reform is the Communist Party prepared to see poor peasants being allocated less than subsistence land but even when they are allocated land they're being taxed on their income even though it's well below subsistence. Now ei either one sort of accepts that view Would that be because the Communist Party didn't want the rich peasant to think they'd be s they were being singled out? That how that their policies were being applied to the whole society. Would that be Erm the justification for it? There's there was an element of that, yes, that Why should they be concerned about the rich peasants? Because they're promoting the rich peasant economy in the short run. Yeah but promoting the economy doesn't necessarily mean It does if we wanna keep them happy. You have to keep them happy in order to I mean inconsistent with what we were saying about What? the objective of politically going for a class struggle yes, sure. Well, they're not gonna have any incentive to invest unless they know their interests are gonna be protected. You know Invest in what? Sorry? In industry? Yeah. Or whatever. I in increasing the surplus, agricultural surplus. But if, if, if that beginning, you know,i if you're going to go for a rich peasant economy, you've gotta convince them that it's, it's their advantage and it's gonna last. There's a sort of, I mean, it is a very favourable tax system in, in relation to the rich. Okay there might be in all sorts of ways, in terms of equality, in terms of socialism, it's, it's all a bit dubious erm but the other reason for taxing down is that, let's face it, the majority of peasants as we, as we saw last week are still poor and if the Communist Party is wanting to maximize its revenue, if it was gonna say okay we're not gonna tax anybody at under six or eight hundred erm you, you're gonna take out er half the population and you would have to get that income by taxing the rich even harder and that would be a disincentive. reasonable system wouldn't it? But it would have been a disincentive on the rich. Erm what proportion of the population was living at subsistence level roughly? Cos, as an idea. Erm well er er the figures we looked at , well i i i it, this is the problem it depends how you define your subsistence level. Now It varies from village to village doesn't it? It's gonna vary from village but it's to an extent although the amount of grain you needed, the amount Yeah. of grain erm But if we say it's around eight hundred Now, yes I mean i i in, in terms of two thousand calories a day it, it s it seems to be six hundred and fifty, seven hundred calories, er seven hundred , right, now th th there are those who argue the hundred and fifty is starvation level. I E it, it, it's it's about a quarter so you, you're on five, six hundred calories a day. So they wouldn't be able to pay the tax would th they wouldn't. Well i i it implies that the Communist Party is actually taxing p taxing poor peasants at three percent of their income even though they are at starvation level. But would they, wouldn't they just in practice overlook it? No. Erm I, I, there were provisions that where er more than ten percent of the population for any area was at the level you would be able to tax at a higher rate. Why, why? What! Your revenue I guess, that, that you need the revenue. Were there, were there people starving?starving. Well I ca what I can't quite understand is, is that why anybody should have come through land reform and still only have that level of income. Erm it may be that the people who were right down at the bottom like that were people who were doing other things as well and were say blacksmiths or whatever Mm. a and, and that I think would not be taken into account, so we're just looking at agricultural income Oh I see yeah. and these people were not depending on agriculture alone. If they are people depending on agriculture along i i it seems an extraordinarily harsh Well they'd be forced out wouldn't they? They would be forced out yes. and work in the factories of the, the rich peasants. The factories of the I think. Well you know what I mean, workshops or whatever. Yes. Yes. Erm but it might mean that in fact we do need to reconsider what we mean by subsistence income. I E bare subsistence might have been three hundred, four hundred . Now if, if one is arguing that then the, the number of peasants who are really below a very basic subsistence level as a result of land reform is, is much lower. Mm. I mean if, if your cut-off point is six or eight hundred say six or eight hundred yo you're gonna, you know, you're into a very large section of the population, if you will come to four hundred and fifty you are into a much, much smaller proportion. But you, you're right that if we stick to somewhere between six hundred and seven hundred as, as a erm even a basic kind of subsistence I E you've just got enough in just, you, you're just not using enough food to get yourself up to two hundred, two thousand calories a day at that rate you were still being taxed on,a at a rate of almost twenty percent of your, of your income. Which meant that net of tax you would,y your, your yield would have to be about eight hundred in order to, net of tax, give you just under seven hundred. How could they before pay rents then? Because that was even more. Right Yes. just don't, you can't reconcile it. So had they put too high a sort of level for subsistence? I mean what did peasants expect to live on, what were their expectations? That's what really matters. I mean this is I er er there, there is a, a fundamental problem here I think th that i if you do the calculations in terms of how many calories per amount of grain it does seem that, that for what we regard as being an adequate diet and then again it's a diet which is not being supplemented by meat okay there will be some vegetables but basically it's grain, you, you do need somewhere between six and seven hundred . And it is clear that there were, that a very significant proportion were not reaching that level and it's being taxed. But they are still surviving and they were surviving and still paying rent on land before nineteen forty nine. But were they? Because quite a lot of the peasants didn't Right. wa wasn't it when, when we were studying about landlord tenant relationships Yeah. that how that erm landlords in practice had to reduce the level of taxation Yes. have loans and stuff, so it just Right. Yes. prolonged Yes. payments. Th th th there's all of that and there is obviously the, the option to borrow and there is the opportunity to work as, as hired labour or handicrafts etcetera. But the assumption must have been that before nineteen forty nine there was a lot of that going on Mhm. more than seemed to be indicated in the figures that we've got, because Buck's figures for the extent of supplementary income are I know they're significant but they're not enough to the kinds of levels people had been living at. But I, I, I think there is a conflict between what we would regard as being a, an acceptable subsistence level and what it would appear that the peasants could possibly have been achieving. I mean it's, it's difficult to bring those two close enough. It's, it's hard to, I think there is this erm farmland I would imagine a very very hard Yes. that may not have involved, been involved in a cash economy. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Right. But I think we, we, we do have to recognize that, that not only are we looking at a land reform process which is providing a lot of peasants with what subsistence land and the Communist Party was taxing them, they were on that below subsistence income. Now that would not be what one would expect er two months ago if I'd said well look you know that's that's what the revolution's gonna bring about you would've said I don't believe you. The only way you can justify it is by saying it's a means to an end. But it, you could equally say that well Yes. But at the same time the Party could argue that it was attempting to equalize things or at least limit inequalities in the sense that, that, that the tax rates were . What i what is really extraordinary I think is the way as you say that in nineteen fifty fifty one, fifty one fifty two, they actually, actually changed the tax schedules so it goes not from the three percent of the bottom, from six or seven percent of the bottom and only up to twenty five percent. But it could also mean that erm they were getti that it they had been successful in getting taxation from what they'd done since the beginning of cos they felt they could go even further. Yes. It could apply to their original taxation policy Yes. But, but, but, but it's a it's a major concession to the rich. A a at precisely the point where one one would expect them to be in the position to be able to encroach on the rich they are actually this is, this is the promotion of the rich peasant economy. Mm. Could that stem from a problem like sort of Marxism is really a theory developed from the g an industrialized, industrializing country Mm. and you've your idea from that but then China is a completely backward country. Oh I see. But it's not only, it's not only There's, there's, there's, there's there's room for it in, in Marxist theory isn't there? Yeah there is. What about Asiatic methods of production and all that sort of thing Yes. I think they were originally for it, I just think there's it is just so backward Mm. that there haven't been any forces of change for a thousand years. I mean perhaps the forces of change that were normal were not inherent in the Chinese Yes. so that they really had to be brought out. Yes. Or created even. Yes. Absolutely. Yes I mean th th th th the fact that you've got a whole range of problems an an and you, you were bound to come up against those problems if you try and define Marxist in a strict sense, and therefore you, you were always seeking to sort of make . Can we just come back to Mm. Can you just go on with your productivity bit. Okay. What I'll do is I'll just quickly skim Yes. through the stuff. Erm that offic regarding productivity from economic impact of land reform, official statistics claimed that between nineteen forty nine to fifty four gross output value of agriculture increased by fifty eight percent. Erm those are the only sort of figures we have and, but nineteen forty nine seemed to be a bad base state because it was about half so that meant that it exaggerate . Erm that had er most economic histor historians agree that between nineteen fifty two, nineteen fifty fifty two there was a healthy recovery and then a slackening off and that erm another consequence of land reform was to decrease the output marketed by peasants and this was because, as we mentioned earlier, the peasants have a high propensity to consume and lower marketing land was rich peasants erm and that one says that there was a new air reported then in the countryside unleashing unprecedented wave of productive enthusiasm, initiative and creativeness but there was also evidence of instability and uncertainty which hindered erm the advance of erm productiv improving productivity and investment. Erm and that how that but through land reform it meant that how that you had erm credit difficulties and that how that landlords who prev previously provided the credit were no longer there and so that meant that how that erm that exasperated problems of increasing productivity and also there was a severe shortage of farm implements and animals cos they weren't redistributed, there was only the surplus that was taken away from the rich peasants and landlords, it meant that how that the, the rich peasants erm you know, got back er they sort of were a self-perpetuating elite in that how the poor peasants just didn't have the means to improving their production. Erm so the Communist Party, to try to counter this sort of erm advance of the rich peasant economy which they saw was getting a bit too far, tried to encourage the formation of mutual aid teams erm but they were very, there were problems in that in erm the implementation of this because peasants were unwilling to share their tools, they weren't compensated for it. Also peasants joining the mutual aid teams feared that erm it would hinder their opportunities of working in other forms of erm er getting other forms of income and that says that only twelve point six percent of the total farming households in Penang, which was quite a progressive place for mutual aid erm teams, er erm were members of MATs in nineteen fifty two. erm I, in m I in my opinion that the Communist Party aim of increasing productivity wasn't actually achieved and because of all these problems erm could that their policy of favour of erm promoting rich peasant economy didn't significantly contribute to industrialization erm I mean there was a little bit of an economic growth but that it wasn't particularly significant. However the agrarian reforms of nineteen fifty wasn't a complete failure and it did provi er play a vital step in socialist transformation of agriculture. It had got rid of this, the old order and new power relations had been established and so it shouldn't be regarded so much as an economic failure but as a profound political and social reform, which is an important step towards the Party's ultimate aim of communism, and going back to the beginning of my paper that how that they had always seen industrialization as a means to an end and that how that socialism and ultimately communism could only be achieved through stages and so that, although it was an economic failure, it was a sort of a social Yes. success. Fine. S so the, the, the really important outcome of land reform is the political and social changes not the economic changes Yes. and although it is being set up to promote a rich peasant economy in order to pave the way for Chinese industrialization, that has not been particularly successful either in terms of the level of output and therefore the levels or in terms of inequalities in that one of the, one of the worrying things that comes through, that comes through, despite the tax system there are still very substantial inequalities and i is the promotion of mutual aid a means, a perceived means of reducing or containing those inequalities? Yes but in practice it, it didn't really work because the Communist Party didn't really erm sort of make a concrete commitment to promoting them and just encouraged them And n u up until nineteen fifty two? Yes and then afterwards. Right. But what, when they do get going it is, it's clear that the mutual aid process does reduce inequalities Erm in that productivity within mutual aid teams goes up. I, I mean But I mean you see the problem is that how the rich erm rich peasants two different mutual aid teams which meant that how that they didn't ha the resources they were sharing were pretty much the same. But, but their productivity still did rise within the mutual aid, of the poor. It, it's the poor that go into mutual aid teams Yes. their productivity rises Is it only marginally though? Well but it comes up to closer to the productivity of the independent middle peasant. Mhm. Perhaps this is, this is something we could we could, we could use to talk about in some revision seminar at the beginning of next term cos we, we, we've sort of got up to nineteen fifty two erm maybe it would be helpful if, if sort of you know we just sat there over the vacation and then come back and sort of have look and see where this has got us. Erm is, is that acceptab Sorry yeah I, I It's, it's not your fault it's, I mean there are once you get into this topic it becomes quite a big one. Erm but if, if you can have a look at, at some of the taxation stuff and about the mutual aid and, and pull the things together a bit. Well the mutual aid people should look at the Yes. and also for taxation is very sort of there's one chapter which quite sort of ? Yes. So the second one, yeah? The second one, yes. And that, I mean it's very very readable and I think if you just read those two books that should give you quite a good But doesn't talk, he does only talk about the economic Erm Wong, are you talking about Wong, that blue one?

I said Mags, look at this! The girls Wendy's girls was making a tape last night for their grandma and granddad you know. Ah! And Keith was acting silly and bloody barking like a dog and miaowing like a cat. Excuse me . Sally can you . Look you moan about everybody else. Practice what you preach. I don't want to lose Maggie, okay. No it's too heavy. Ooh reckon it's gonna snow don't they. That's what Dave was just saying No that's not. I'll never get up on the wagon. Well just hope just pray and hope that the temperature don't go up slightly. Cos if it does then it will. Well they forecast don't they? well no if it's cold then all of a sudden the temperature will suddenly rise. And that's the time when you get snow. It's not. We don't have no snow February do we? So did they all have fun nosing at your hamper when it was brought in? Well I came back from coffee and it was nearly put away. Did she tell you about my Oh dear. sagging is he? She said Maggie you're not gonna leave that cupboard like that are you. I said why what's wrong with it? She said you stand here and have a look. Mm goodness. got ours down there and in here. Yeah. You got to hide all the booze away here. Had to hide We've had to hide the booze. Donna'll be here next week. Now is that supposed to mean something! Say no more innit? Yeah but David's coming with her. And a mate of his as well and the kids. So that's it. The booze has got hid. Got to hide everything away. And Clayton's not allowed to open his big mouth. Put it in the shed and lock it up. out of sight all your tins and glasses. Yeah. outside like. Yeah. I er I forgot about them the night before and I forgot to tell her about it last night so. Veronica came up didn't she yesterday to see where her er has Sally got her stuff please. Good grief. And I said no she hasn't. I said she can't get in to the shop. Not this week. Well it's tough. she told me there ain't no wo , no point going in now before for the night anyway because everything's so dear. That's it. get's a list Well that's it. I just get what I can. Yeah well it's cheaper for us anyway. Cos they'll try and sell it most of it off anyway because they have their stocktaking. They'll restock won't they in the new year? To start off again I suppose. Yeah. They try and get as rid of as much as possible. Do you wanna cake Maggie? No thank you Dave. Sure? Mag? Quite sure thank you. polite to you isn't he? What's wrong with he? Here you are, you can sit here Well being as he tried to squash me twice behind the back door. He's got to be polite. Then Didn't squash your arse behind the back door. There isn't enough room. Hush up you. He stuck his cold angle down my neck. Oh why is it every time I sit somewhere he's always got to sit somewhere near me. Well Like on the bus. He loves you Julie.

I thought oh god here we go. Were you there were you? Yeah You were sat in the back seat were you? Well not not when he got pulled but he I was sat in the backseat when he was pissy. He was talking about it and he can get really pissy. Then we goes in the garage. Well have you tried to park in the garage at Don't bother. It is so narrow. There's no room to manoeuvre and we got no lock on our car. You should have seen the state he was getting in when he cos he couldn't get round the bloody corner. Found it hard to get our Cortina round. so heavy. Listen to this Rover three five manual, alloy wheels. No m.o.t. or tax. Two hundred and fifty pounds. cos it's an old car. Mind you. He enjoyed coming out with us last Saturday didn't he? Oh he well yeah. He was getting D'you go round and round. To go down?loving that. Oh my god. foot on the brakes Oh I was, yesterday that well was it yesterday? Yeah yesterday night. I was following a car home. I know it was a learner like and obviously it was her first time out. She mounted the pavement three times. Oh. Anyway. He was coming along, there was a push-bike in front. I said to him watch this now she'll sit all the way right to the end behind him. She did. So anyway we come up to the roundabout and she never. She just had to turn out, and there was nothing coming down , foot down, opened up, got I was at the top of the hill and she was nowhere in sight. I thought them poor cars behind me. Oh. Because she was terrible. We went out Saturday night. We got up the top there . Up here where up you know going up towards like Wellings way. And a bloody car was in front like that. We was here Oi! That's my fucking tea Ah. Oh. Language! No good saying oh! . Julie said here's your tea here. No I never. You did! Well I didn't say for you. You did love. No I never. Don't Oh well. Anyhow. As we were saying. Car in front. We're here. Car here. And he just decides to pull over like that doesn't he? No he pull outwards from there. Well explain. He was stopped. He pulled out That's right pulled in. Pull in. Then he pushed straight out. Oh no. Didn't to indicate he was coming out. signals or nothing. Just pushed out. He must ha , he was looking, somebody looking for a house. Realized it wasn't there. Didn't bother to look in the mirror see what on behind. Just pulled straight out. So David was jolly happy weren't they, that lot? da da da da Yeah I'll bet. Yeah nearly on that bend as well. You know as you go round Mm. Where Terry used to live. Yeah. Some crackpots on the road mind isn't there? It's like on that bike Pick our Dan at Saltford look. Go up the roundabout. Straight on down there and straight towards The Globe on the corner? Oh I know, yeah. And coming back the other way. He always cuts somebody up along there because they're going too fast. You see they see a straight road on the outside lane. Go straight down decides to indicate an attempt to deny polytheism, but there are lots of places in the Bible where it hasn't been consistent and where God on occasions speaks in the Bible erm as if other gods could exist, like I, I, I'm the Lord, I'm a jealous god. Why should he be jealous if there are no gods to be jealous of? There are lots of bits of evidence that suggest that the Bible has been consistently rewritten to make it more monotheistic than it really was in the beginning. In the beginning, okay believed in and or whatever you wanna call it, but it also believed in other gods as well, except he was the chief god, he was number one god as it were and he's the one you got to follow. These other gods exist, but they're the wrong gods. There was a tendency says Freud to eliminate all the wrong gods and say there is only one god but the whole point . That of course is exactly what Akhenaten tried to do at the beginning another example the return of the repressed its original religious intolerance. Well it's an interesting thesis. As I said I'll be having quite a lot to say about in the lectures, so we'll just regard this class as a kind of prelude to that. Er Andrea, er it's gone eleven I mustn't detain you any longer. Congratulations on excellent paper, first class er well done. Next week are hearing from Simone who isn't here. Now folks if you see Simone remind her. Anybody know Simone anthropologists? Okay Yes. Yeah let me tell you actually yeah the following week. Oh okay. Two weeks today okay. Great opportunity to pass on genes effortlessly, though the female has a limited number of eggs which has specific requirements for survival and therefore temporar temporarily stalls her reproductive success. So from the moment of concep conception because females are biologically out-of-gear now have a much higher potentially accepted success. Even if relative initial differences in intentionally productive success they have the groundwork for different male and female receptive strategies. Now first the receptive strategy for males. For males the characteristic meaning of strategy is the continuous pattern of low or no . Because of high potential reproductive success and their effort to earn the parental care for seeking additional mates. internal behaviour in in most species. Another reason for low in males is the . In species where fertilization is internal, they are also much less pertinent with genetic relationship of offspring because investing in unrelated offsprings one's . Furthermore, males minimize vest investment in attempt to their potential for reproduct for a high reproductive success. This takes a great deal of effort because simply having the potential for a greater reproductive success in females does not necessarily mean that they actual have ha actually have greater reproductive success. This is because males vary greatly among themselves in success. Such males have large numbers of offspring while others might have none at all. Erm so we still that in general erm males have potential for greater reprodu reproductive success than females, but erm this, this doesn't actually, they don't always er actualize their potential because erm some do there's a great difference among males and erm just some of them will have great er large numbers of offspring, whereas other males might not have any at all. Erm for the females the variance in reproductive success is of the, the differences in the female condition such as the ability to invest in offspring, erm or food producing , but among the males the variation in reproductive success are a function of male competition and female shortage. Males compete with each other for females and for ever more are subject to females for particular members are not the reproductive strategy for females. For females mating strategy differs due to and reproductive success of biological specialization and parental care, such as the gestation . Consequently females are expected to select mates most capable of investing resources in their offspring. Possible strategies include the domestic strategy where the female recognizes domestic qualities in males in advance and therefore benefits herself by choosing a male with qualities. An alternative strategy is the where the female is resigned to getting no help from the mate and concentrating rather on selecting a mate with the best genes and in this case . So as a result of combining both of these strategies the differing male and female strategies Come in. Hi, how you doing? erm you end up with four different er types of er reproductive strategies which are of monogamy, polygyny, polygamy and polyandry and the first one monogamy is when you have one male and female and er this minimizes the differences in reproductive success and the way it does that is because erm it, it minimizes the difference between the sexes because monogamy takes the limitations of the male erm to reproduce only with the one female so the male to female ratio of reproductive success the same in monogamy, and er what happens to that is this little in er more equal towards their parental investment . Er the second polygyny where you have one male and then females and here reproductive success erm meaning that there's a large again you'll have the males who'll have the large reproductive success than males who have none at all and erm of course often differences between male and female because the male has and the male has opportunities to erm try to control success rate the female biological and er consequently with this kind of system from female choice and male competition and er are about eighty percent and er polygamy is when you have many males and many females and er is also and er I would assume it's kind of like males have opportunities . But again the result of that system the main difference with that would be you know if they had different erm partners, whereas other one partner. Erm polyandry's the last type of example, he has one erm many males and one female and with this system the differences between the sexes is the first and er males that do their larger parental investment females and it's a very rare . Now on the other side of parental investment is desertion. The other alternatives of parental investment is desertion. When investing offspring, when investing offspring results in increased males stay together, but if it is possible to reach by deserting a partner, then the individual is likely to be erm you can't decide on based on potential opportunities made parental investment. because of the those offspring can survive without further parental investment and if parental investment is therefore . The decision based on a number of current offspring, larger numbers can be greater benefited with and therefore it's more likely that if the parent had a lot of er offspring then he would continue with the investment and erm the conclusion from now is that males have a greater reproductive success, therefore they are more likely to desert because they can erm and erm this and erm the basic argument of this is one parent can get away with investing less share of erm resources they're likely to spend more er then they're to do it, so in other words erm if, if one of the, of the two is being to get away with having the other they can go out to er pursue their own and therefore erm each partner force the other to invest more. Okay that's basically erm I have to say. I have a few questions of my own erm in, in doing it and erm was er when you say that, that males had males parental investment erm I was wondering how they, how can a male when the male decides to desert how can they be certain if the female is going to take care of the offspring, because I was wondering if erm if probability like the based by their genes it doesn't matter if one female doesn't take care of the offspring because they produce more offspring I think that would depend on the species wouldn't it and the, and the local conditions, for example in that erm case I mentioned in yesterday's lecture monogamous birds with long breeding groups where you get desertion. What seems to happen there is the bird that's deserted has to stay with the existing family because if he or she erm deserts, those chicks will, will, will die, so er it's what is sometimes called the Concorde fallacy that if you put a lot of resources into something, you've gotta see it through, because if you pull out just before the end you can lose everything, whereas i if, if you stay on even if you know it's a failure, erm at least you may get something out of it, so the, in that case wi with monogamous birds the parent that's deserted the one that's left may have to stay, because if they desert then they can have no reproductive success whatsoever whereas at least if they stay they get something. Erm in fact a similar effect happens, I'll be mentioning this in the lecture but let me just mention it now. A similar thing can happen with so-called piracy in fish. Erm one of the problems fish have on this is that they lay their eggs in gravel or something like that and where males have their own nest sometimes another male comes along and er takes it over, hijacks it piracy and interestingly enough what happens in those situations a pirate male will come in, displace the existing male from his nest and fertilize a few eggs and then buzz off. The resident male who was displaced then comes back and looks after all the eggs, including those of the pirate and the reason he does it presumably in the first place he can't distinguish which eggs he's fertilized and those fertilized by the pirate and secondly, he knows he's fertilized some of the eggs and therefore it pays him to stay and look after all of them. So erm in other words i it wou would depend on the circumstances on how much has already been invested. In the case of human beings of course you have to notice that men seem to have an advantage because as I think I mention i in the lectures, it's perfectly possible, you see this happening in our own society which is supposed to be monogamous, perfectly possible for a man to get married, raise a family and then in his forties to desert his wife and raise a second family. Much more difficult for a woman because by the time a woman's got into her forties, her child rearing erm career is usually rather short and even if she wants to continue, it becomes much more hazardous for her and for her offspring, so er in, in the case of erm modern societies with erm monogamy bu but divorce as we have, you can't help thinking that to some extent the, the odds are, are loaded in the favour of men as it were in terms of their reproductive success. It's paradoxical because often divorce law reforms thought of as favouring women and in circumspect that allows women to get away from an unreasonable husband and that kind of thing, it's certainly true, but at the same time you have to notice that in terms of reproductive success it may benefit more er men more . Okay, now so I think what one may have to say it depends on the species and the circumstance. Does that answer your question? We can come back to this, I mean have you got any others? Yeah, erm modern when in choosing a mate and er connection with that because with the assumption that males generally don't give any parental investment what really benefit them to you know biologically can, can support the offspring themselves short period of time why can't they then go you know to have their own I mean Right, right Yes, I mean you put your finger on an important problem here that we need to discuss and that is that if you concentrate on human beings in general, and this is true on our own society but I, I think it's true of just about all societies and it's emphatically true of primal hunting adult societies then men do make a lot of parental investment don't they? I mean you think about primal hunting adults like the bushmen or the Australian Aborigines, the the men do the, do the hunting for erm for meat and women do the, do the gathering for and the point is that er meat is very nutritious and it's an important part of their diet and men go hunting and they come back and they share food with their wives and their relatives or someone and male parental investment is terribly important So women for instance if you ask David McKnight who's a world authority on the Australian Aborigines and has spent many years living with them, say what do women look for in the traditional society, what do women look for in a husband? His answer is immediate and emphatic a good hunter, he says you know what a woman wants in a, in a husband is a man who can you know bring home the bacon literally, er it's not smoked of course, but it's fresh! But you see the point, so in our species and of course in most societies this is true men are breadwinners whether in an agricultural society or an industrial society erm you know one often feels that if you're the man in the family you earn all the money your wife spends it on most of the time erm it certainly happens to me er I spend most of my time working while my wife spends most of the time shopping but erm she certainly spends the money, but erm but the, the Well I think you know you've gotta, gotta speak up for us poor husbands sometimes erm the er but you see the point I'm making, in our species males do contribute. Now, this contribution is not direct, it's indirect in the sense that males, a male for example who is provisioning a wife who is pregnant is not directly invent investing in the offspring clearly you can't do that she has to do that, cos the offspring's inside her body, but indirectly he may be feeding his wife, protecting her and providing for her in, in a way that is absolutely critical to her reproductive success too. So it's important to notice that in many species and certainly in ours, although males need not as you say make any contribution apart from their genes in principle, in fact males are heavy investors in offspring, albeit indirectly, so that must be important mustn't it and that must But the thing is that it seems that we're a cultural the way the system is set up Yeah I mean to begin with then obviously the female livelihood they depend on that primal investment it's, it's a situation the way that that it's divided up Well presumably the reason why the men do the hunting is that they're they figure they're more aggressive and are not gonna be pregnant or incumbent to children. Well,i i i i in that sense it's logical that they're the ones that do er the hunting and I guess the way it's set up logical I think Mm but I don't see, I'm trying to make it like a genetic connection or something I mean or some kind of like you know I mean to me it's just set up Yes, yes sorry Katherine? Erm I think well the which is erm which is directly extrapolated to like what happened now Mm. and there's this thing about I mean you know that there that we may be behaving, there may be erm ways that we behave that aren't actually functional th the, the society we've got now might not actually be functional because of the technology we've got Yeah well that's the problem Yeah. I mean Yeah then but when that becomes No, oh no, certainly not, but, but I mean before we get to the prescriptive level which is quite er a, a long way down the road, at the analytic level I think, I think Anne-Marie's point is she's trying to understand erm just what the the significances of these difference in parental investment are. Er the point I was making to her was erm in her paper which er was excellent by the way, I forgot to say and I think you put it all very clearly and very nicely,y you, you very nicely set out the basic idea that the consequence and that in principle a male need contribute nothing more than his penis. Th th the point that erm we were then discussing was that in practice of course males may,m ma may contribute a lot more an and, and the question was is this er something to do with the adaptions of our species or is it just the this was the question you, you asked me wasn't it? And Katherine's point was what the system today of course is quite different than what and that is of course completely true. Erm, the, the question remains however I mean er you, this is, this is your point really to what extent other other characteristics er may erm may be part of the same erm of the same thing for example if, look at sexual dimorphism. Human beings as we know are sexually dimorphic and tha that figure seems to fit the er the, the pattern, but erm women have a lot of characteristics that are peculiar to them, like for example erm more youthful looks, women will retain more youthful looks longer than men do and it is normally regarded as important and a lot of women spend an awful lot of money in the modern society on trying to remain erm looking er looking youthful. Now why is that? Could that be for example because males with resources would want normally to acquire youthful wives, or perhaps it might in other words it could be couldn't it that if males provide resources to females that they can use for primal investment, this would then have selective effects on females who will want certain things in order to get erm the investment and one of the things they might want to do is to look youthful. I dunno it kind of figures doesn't it or not? Alex looks very sceptical. No I don't, I'm still thinking about what you said yesterday about premature ejaculation Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. and younger men Th it all fitted together did it oh I oh I see I was sort of like more light-hearted sort of er like er got plenty of money, but it's crappy pay. Oh yes, I like the joke you know er er where one women says to another how could X possibly marry him you know Yeah he, he, he's Got a nasty cough, providing disorders you know he's short and ugly an and the other lady says to her but er you should see how tall he is when he stands on his wallet. I mean Yeah and he starts premature ejaculation Erm I mean it could be or it could be the reason why er why younger not Yes, I mean it's generally true isn't it I think of all societies I can't think of any o of, of any exceptions that it normally is older males who have more resources. I think in all societies I can't It can older males that Well gonna say you know yeah There's an interesting study in the book printed by Bergahoff, Moulder and so on all those you know there's four, thing, thing and thing erm human reproductive whatever it is, it's on the reading list, of Kipsigy Payments now that's, has anybody read that? Well that's interesting the Kipsigies are er traditional people who live in Kenya and if they have , in other words er men have to pay a certain amount to the erm you know, woman if they're gonna marry her and what they did was they study the and related it to the, to the girl that was actually getting married and what they found of course was that it fits the predictions of our theory er just as you'd expect, given that the cultural things you have to allow for like, like for example in that most traditional cultures they like er women to be plump as we'll see in the, in the actually fat is critical to female fertility and er so they might not have been plump, so what they did was they simply weighed the girls and they compared their, their, their weights with, with the, with the and sure enough strong correlation the fatter the girl, the bigger the . In a way they were and they had two they had two disabled girls, there are two girls who were erm you know physically er disabled, I forget what was wrong with them I think one had a clubfoot or something an and they were almost free they weren't completely free, but they were nearly free because of their disabilities and Yeah, exactly, so if, if you look at it in terms of the Kipsigy you know system, you can clearly see that what they showed was youth and plumpness were the critical fac an an and attractiveness, if the girl was young, plump and attractive she got a high and if the girl was older erm, if she had something wrong with her or she was skinny, then the less and that's, so it's quite interesting Did they find that the older men ? Well, yes now in fact we know they have not in that study. Now that doesn't the Kipsigy was just the study of the erm you know it's a good statistical it's good hard-hat social science you know with distribution and everything it's all good stuff, erm they don't say that, where we do know this is something I have researched myself very carefully, the Australian Aborigines erm we have rich data on this and I've read an awful lot of it and I compared notes with world authorities like David McKnight and erm erm what's his name erm Shapiro authority on this, and they agree that er that's definitely what happens. In Australian Aborigines the young, the young girls go to the er the older powerful men . Of course, if you think about it the consequences of that is these guys die and when they die, those wives that they married as young girls are now middle-aged women or possibly younger, anyway past their youth, but th th they, they may not be . Certainly they're re-marriageable and these are societies where every woman is married but no spinsters, so they're redistributed. Very often they have a bit of a say in it, because you know that the young girl hasn't got, but erm interestingly enough they tend to get recycled to young men and it's the older men that get the young girls from their older male and it's younger men who get . You can sometimes get a situation that occurs where a man is married to a woman who is in fact his grandmother, this can happen. This leads to horrifying you think that if you work if you, if you think about it, in other words he has married a woman who is the mother of a wife of his father who he calls mother. I happen to think this is the key to Australian classificated kinship society very stressful . What is really going on is they are rigging a system to hide that kind of it's clearly anonymous to marry a woman who's your grandmother. Yes, in the sense that y y i it can happen and apparently sometimes does that the young man will receive a recycled wife who is in fact the mother of a daughter who has married his father and so he calls her the daughter-mother, her actual mother is his wife. I see Absolutely and this is why I think they get round this, they've solved this problem by saying okay folks, we will adopt a purely erm classificator or in other words fictitious, rigged system of kinship and we won't call there and that's what they do. What effectively, I think, I mean I've never actually sat down because it would be an enormous mistake and nobody would thank me for it, but my guess is that those enormously complex classificated can be understood as a method by which old men rig the system for their own benefit and hide this kinds of ridiculous anonymous and the anomaly basically is the young men end up with old wives When they get older Right, that's what happens you see. When they get Could it be also that erm children I mean I dunno how they, the children are reared and what sort of situation . Could it be that er evolution in sort of Aboriginal societies are more harsher than that allowed for a more experienced man to teach a young child how to live as opposed to, it, it's beneficial for Yes experience That's right. Again that, that is, is very clear and it's representing initiation rituals. Because what happens you see in these societies and Australian Aborigines are with no exceptions is that if you want a wife if you're a young man and you want a wife you first of all gotta get initiated. There's no way you will get a wife until you are initiated. In fact you won't get any sexually mature erm er woman to have er any relationship with men, unofficial or otherwise if you're not initiated because they'll just say you're a boy and, and er and er an adult woman would feel it was demeaning you know to sleep with a mere boy, she'd insist you've got to be a man and to be a man you normally got to be initiated and that normally means being circumcised. Now the, the initiations are controlled by the elder men who have all, all the wives and if you don't behave and join the club and conform to what th the crown elders expect, you won't get initiated and i if you don't unless you say you won't get any wives and the guys who are doing the initiating the initiated are the very same guys who have all the daughters. So a young man really has to get initiated and conform to what the elders expect if he's going to have any reproductive success at all and that's exactly what happens. So these guys undergo these horrifying initiation rituals to prove you know that they want to join the club band and i if they pass the initiation test then they're joined in and then they're given a wife. In many societies David McKnight tells me the man who does the circumcision who actually chops off the foreskins as it were, owes you a wife for it and he says in many of them if you give a man your foreskin then you've got a right to demand a wife. He says he knows cases where wives weren't given, and there were then very serious er conflicts broken up, because the man who didn't get the wife then thought he'd been cheated and apparently his complaint was you know er wife I give you my foreskin. Apparently they talk like this. David McKnight says this is the language they use you know. Australian Aborigines are very direct about this so they, so they do expect something back for the initiation an and it's a kind of reciprocal thing where okay, you initiate me and I'll put up with all this crap from you, but you know, you give me a wife, you've got daughters I want a wife and er if I don't get it, there's gonna be real trouble and this is how the system works. So you're quite right, the elder men have a tremendous control, not over on the over-supply of women, but also over the younger men. How can that be beneficial I know what you're saying but Well I think the answer to that is you've got to remember this kind of hunting is cooperative and cooperative hunting does rely first of all on having other men to go hunting with you which is, which is important and also or so I'm told by people like David McKnight and Warren Shapiro an awful lot depends on information, we want to know where the game is, who saw what where, what did they catch you know, was there rainfall over the so and so ranges and so on, and you need to know that information if you're gonna be an effective hunter and you need good communication with other men. Er very often Australian Aboriginal societies you meet men the corroborees at these ritual gatherings and if you're one of the club, then in the ritual they'll tell you, they'll say hey, you know, you know you know you say where did you get all these kangaroos you know oh we got them over at the so and so ranges or down at the so and so water hole that's where they all are this week, and this is very important information for man. If you're not a member of the club and you're not accepted the rituals and people don't like you, they won't tell you and as a result you won't be an effective hunter, you won't be able to support many wives even if you wanted them and if you have wives what they needed, because if a man doesn't feed his wives they, they, they all eventually get up and go, they'll say two fingers you know, you can't feed us. This is one of the things I want you to se see today and this wonderful film I was gonna show today and I hope I'll show next week, third time lucky, they actually interview the wives, the polygynous wives of of some erm erm guy in Africa, some African erm and they to them they actually ask the wives, why do you, you know why are you married to this man and they say well he feeds us, you know th that's why we're married to him, he gives us food and he's apparently got five this particular man they interviewed, three of them were active and two of them were elderly, and the three active wives are quite open about the fact that this man's a good provider and therefore they stay with him, but they, they wouldn't in the case of Australian Aborigines, they wouldn't stay if they didn't get fed and they only get fed because he's a good hunter and to be a good hunter you need to go on good terms of men and that's how it works. But of course it's, it's a very tough deal for women, I mean women in erm in a way really get the raw end of it because that to some extent they're at the mercy of the whole system, even though they can if they absolutely have to. It's not easy and where's she gonna go? You know she's gotta find someone else to go an and live with because by and large you can't survive on your own in the Australian outback certainly not if you're a woman, hardly if you're a man. So it, it's as you say it's a very tough, hard life and in order to survive, people really do need the help of other people and that's why you've really got to conform to a large extent in the society and you haven't got a lot of choice about erm you know wh what you'd like to especially if you're, if you're young and female and not much men not if you want to get any wives that is. So the erm but as, but as Katherine reminds us, I mean if, if that's the kind of life our emotional parameters are my, my guess is that that, is that that's probably the truth, certainly a persuasive argument . Then when you look at the other range of human societies, then you have to say well you know how is it, how is it working out in other in other types of societies where all the basic erm conditions of life may be different and that of course is one of these big erm big and small problems that we still, we're still really at the at the starting point fact. I mean does anybody think that parental investment theory is relevant at all to modern industrial society or is it completely irrelevant ? Matthew you're a, you're a sceptic and a, and a, and a and an independent thinker what do you think? I don't know, I'm not very sort of convinced one way nor the other That sounds judicious. Dean? Well, I'm, I'm a supporter of it, which you know erm it, it strikes me being far more effective than other forms er of er explanation. How much ice does it cut in the modern industrial society? I think, I think it think it must cut quite a lot because I mean there's certain I don't these biological constraints. How would they show themselves I mean? What people to look you know in the modern society women don't have to rely on men or don't have to have traditional sex roles, this is a point of view isn't it? Well I think er I think, well I think you have to have, I mean I don't really parental investment and stuff like that gestation period. I think, I think that in any, I mean in, in, in, if you wanna, if you wanna look at it in terms I mean I think labour it it's always gonna have to be there and I think the biological constraints put the you know, sharpened device Well there are ways aren't there I mean even in traditionally, I mean what of wet-nursing I mean that's an example isn't it where a woman gets another woman to do the job for her. Darren is that, what point were you gonna make? Well I think, like I said two ways one is erm Mm Or if you look at it another way that is men and women are equal and we haven't yet got round that they are very different but they are equal. I dunno, er you know you can put woman staying at home having the child for instance when there aren't enough children to fill the schools realize that having children is a very important in economic values what with nations increasing staying at home Yes I must say I, I personally sympathy with that I mean I think that erm, women's er role is er very much despised and disparaged it should be because if you think about it they're having the children and bringing them up, well this is one of the most worthwhile things to do society you can't going to survive unless you have a woman back in the having the kids and we might see that as a you know you laugh when I say that, you know Well he doesn't survive, he might survive Alright, alright this is what I mean yeah, yeah but you know it's really difficult discussing this topic without people sniggering and getting all upset . It's that they have equal decisions, really so you can't say . It's only how we of behaviour Well but they are really equal because without one another, they're not gonna I don't think, I don't think it will, I think erm certainly from a cultural point of view the questions that comes up of erm in that type of society they think sod this I'm going hunting, but the fact of the matter is the men . I mean time of physiological difference and strength needs of their strength that they could just about fire a and he couldn't even pull them back and so they you know, fine if you wanna go hunting use the boat Yeah the arrows, but the Yeah, yeah and, it's but then it's a question of where a woman a woman could, but you know is it that easy to jump out cultural you know cultural investment provided by that and er you know y y y you and if a man is slightly stronger other way round so he can collect, collect more food and another argument which is that Yeah, it's the, it's the with the word natural isn't it that er you know people often use the word natural to mean good and right and therefore something you should do, but of course no not always I mean if I said to you death is natural, nobody here would think I was advocating suicide or that er we shouldn't have hospitals to try and save people's lives I mean er when you say death is natural, what you mean is death is one of those things that we just have to put up with, we'd rather we didn't but we're all gonna have to face it in the end, some of us sooner than others er but erm but there we are. However if you say erm oh well you know erm boys will be boys that's natural,tha that sounds as if you're kind of making excuses for them and condoning them, so I think you've got to be very careful about how you use the word natural and clearly it raises the whole question of how far you can, you can push erm cultural ideals against natural constraints an and what really is the issue. You see it may be that Dean's right I must admit I think I, I agree with Dean I think he is right that the real problem is that natural selection may have fitted us by, as it were, rigging our emotional system. It may be at a, at a truly rational level we can all perfectly well do all kinds of other things rationally on a truly rational level, because there we have this this er high degree of that comes with rationality, but at a deeper, kind of gut level,the emotional feelings we, we find that it's, it's much more difficult, and at that point if you don't try and change things and do things that are unnatural, you find you're kind of going against the emotional grain and er perhaps some people find it easier than others, but perhaps everybody will feel a certain erm tug as it were, certain erm discomfort or a certain emotional alienation from themselves which er perhaps is because we're trying to do something more basic we just weren't designed for. I don't know I mean this would Would you sympathise with that Dean? Yeah, yeah question so, so we're, we're saying that the difference between male and female roles in this disruptive selection. Sorry remind us what you mean by disruptive selection again. Where, well where er disruptive selection i i i is very huge differences between men, male and female and this was then accentuated over a period of time Oh I see what you mean yes, fine, okay. Okay, so are, so, so it's just tha tha tha that along with this a psychological context, so you got a biological and psychological going hand-in-hand simultaneously. Yes, I mean this is the point I'll be developing later, later in, in, in the lectures, I'm currently spending a lot of time kind of researching and thinking about this, but i i it's ultimately the question of genes affect behaviour and more and more I come to the to the view that they probably do so erm through what we call our emotions, that our genes kind of erm guide us to do so and things through various subjective feelings like when we're hungry, we, we know we're hungry and it's a subjective feeling of hunger. What is actually happening of course we know in that case what is actually happening, because nerves erm er neurones in, in the base of the brain are actually sampling the blood flow as it goes through with sugar level and when the sugar level drops to a critical point, some of those neurones start to fire and as they fire gradually the message is passed on up to the higher brain centres and eventually you get the feeling you're hungry. Now, you, you're, that's a subjective feeling, you don't actually know that there are neurones in your blood sugar level, but you, you certainly know when you need something to eat and it, it's a kind of subjective feeling and it's not farfetched in the least to claim that our genes have rigged our brain in that way to do that because obviously we'd like to have more reproductive success if you know when you're hungry than when you don't and it may be that a lot of, in a lot of other ways genes affect our, our behaviour through similar erm effects, that is subjective feelings we have, often of an emotional nature to make us want to do certain things and an an and dislike doing others, and it may be that we, we're really kind of lumbered with that. Why is it in the genes why is it people are able to adjust their diets Well, oh yes, I'm sure I'm not saying that's the only thing that controls people's food intake I mean clearly there are things cultural some cultures, the Japanese seem to love eating raw fish, I mean how they can bring themselves to do it I do now know, I mean the raw is I don't think I'd want to eat again, but er erm not always if they were cooked either, but erm the, the er and certainly if you look at the Australian Aborigines even though we take the Australian Aborigines as our kind of primeval people, they have astonishing food taboos, I mean their attitudes to food are very very culturally er effective to, to a quite extraordinary extent, some so that somebody somebody discovered that eating a tabooed food by accident, they'll get very ill, a kind of psychosomatic illness. So I'm not saying th th that there aren't these th the important other inputs, but, but what I am saying is that if you ask yourself where the kind of gene behaviour interface really exists is clearly in the human er in, in the human mind and it may be that the basic kind of parameters erm have, have been set for our emotions and I really don't see how we can change those. I was thinking for instance when you have generation of young men how do you, what's the time left to something extreme can be done culturally and people can be sort of you know convinced that they're right and that they go out there and get machine guns can be done culturally, whereas Well it may be of course that that kind of thing has always tended to happen gather of society skirmishing goes on and young men are expected to go and find very often Yeah, yeah, more immediately, but I mean when they're sort of it has Well then I agree, then I, then I think you do need a fairly sophisticated psychological theory to try and explain er how that could come about. That's one of the reasons why I'm, why I'm also interested in er in Freud because I think Freud provides that, I happen to think that Freud's studies of, of crowd group psychology actually explain that, although it takes time to you know, certainly not at five minutes to four, it takes time to explain, but I think there is an explanation there and I think you c y y you can claim that there are certain emotions to do with identification and idealization,th that our genes have a programmer which things like erm nationalistic erm, erm er kind of jingoism can exploit in a modern culture which in primal cultures would have primal cultures people identify with their, with their local kin and their local culture and that's that might ultimately promote their reproductive success, but that in modern cultures, this identification occurs with erm on a completely different level and with lots of people will not merely because you need so many more people modern cultures you have much more erm much bigger groups and you just meet many more people that, than you were ever th there is some interesting research, research recently published for instance which shows erm organizations seem to have a critical size and that people are not really able to track more than about two hundred and fifty other people, in other words you can have face-to-face relationships with up to about two hundred and fifty others, but once it gets beyond two hundred and fifty it's too much and you start forgetting somebody as if the brain was primed to an optimum group size and once you get above that you just can't keep . Have you read about that? That's right, I would say so Yeah That's right, yeah yeah. Yeah That's right yeah. Is there also something to do what's happening in Eastern Europe . They say you know Swiss Well you see the, the, the great Soviet experiment is a good example isn't it of, of a whole civilization was based on a o o on a kind of great social experiment was based on ultimately on erm unsound principles and then a part of the scenes. Er and I suppose the great you know lesson of social sciences in, in some ways if it's, if it's for anything it ought to be to try and avoid that kind of disaster, because erm if we understood ourselves better we might you know in the future try and avoid that thing because we just wouldn't attempt if, if that wasn't an attempt to be . So erm I mean the justification for this kind of course I would claim is ultimately to try and make people more realistic about what is possible and er the, because th th the advantage of knowing what's possible is you can avoid impossible experiments that ultimately result in disaster for everyone. Well sceptical silence, but that's what I'd like to think that we, we were doing. Well yes. Drug, anti-drug legislation may be another thing. Of course drugs is, is one of the wonderful examples that the very thing that Katherine was talking about, something that wasn't there in the beginning and that has been produced by modern technology and is now a big problem, but is not a problem to Australian Aborigines because they don't have any drugs er to speak of, of course now they do and alcohol is a terrible problem with Australian Aborigines I talked to David McKnight about it. Absolutely awful . Well the Australians are at least trying to didn't have much success apparently Really? and they went loco Folks it's four o'clock erm just a second erm just before you go let me remind you next week it's Laura. Okay? And Darren we gotta, I'll see you in just a sec. Hello. Ah really? Erm, who, who gave you the message? Oh er, I, I don't think I ra I don't think I rang you actually, er I wonder if the message was from someone else. Erm, I do need to see you some time erm let me just just see erm, but I've got your erm your last term's report here that we need to meet to discuss. Er, could, could we make a date? Erm, as I said it wasn't me that phoned originally, my guess is that there may be somebody else at the school who is trying to contact you, but while you're on the line, let's just make a little let's just make a little date. Erm what about, when would be convenient for a quick tutorial? What about Thursday? Right. What about next week, what about Monday? Right y your day off, well that means you don't want to come into the school? Okay next Monday, what time would suit you? Right. Right. Could we make it at erm two P M? Right, that's two P M next Monday the first February, okay. See you then. As I said I didn't phone, I dunno who it was. Erm, it might be an idea to try and get hold of him whoever took the message cos it might be something important, but anyway I'm glad you phoned. Thanks, bye . Right now, sorry to keep you waiting for a minute. Erm, now did we, did we do your reports? No. Right, let's, let's do that first cos that's important. Erm, I'll have to sign the form. There we are, right. Right I got all four here of course I didn't bother to write a comment cos I'm delighted. I've given you an A for participation B plus for written work and that gives you an average of B which is good or excellent. So that's alright there's no problems there. Now Mr 's philosophy Aha. has given you A for participation which is good, C for written work which is satisfactory and B minus for assessment, so it actively participates er gave a paper for the class, but no second essay. Does that mean you owe him an essay or something? No,essays, you got both you've got two essays. Well, right he's, this was probably written before he got the second one, because they would have done this last term They were handed in on time, handed in on time. Well, perhaps you ought to bring that He marked them both. I should raise that with him He's marked them both Has he? Yeah. Right. I mean I got pretty bad marks I find it difficult, find it very difficult. Really? Well, it's frustrating the hell out of me you know. Why's that? I've never done any ooh well. Right what can I do for you today . Er you sent me on I'm gonna go, and I came up before the receptionist. She said something about changing it. Oh aye right, right that was for your x-rays Robert. Right, aye, that's right. Starting to show a bit of arthritis, in the knee. That's what begun you your trouble, down there. Basically like I say it's just when I, when I bend it, Mhm. to extension like, you know. That's right. Thirteenth Is this when your line's due Robert? Yeah it's roughly about. Round about now. Aye. There we are now. And I think he'll have it in for you. Right you are, thanks a lot, Doctor . Okay? Right. Just keep that knee moving as much as you can. As I say it's when I take the bandage off at night. Aye. to the wife, Aye. if you get what I mean. Aye. Listen you you've got you've got to watch, don't let it down, bandage it all the time, Robert. Give yourself an hour or two at night Aye, aha, aye. just getting it keeping it moving. Right you are. Keep the joint,what's happening is the the the smooth side is starting to get a wee bit rough and if you can keep that rubbing off the other bone it smooths it down. Great. Aye, aye Okay? So you're taking a file Aye, aye. and filing away a rough edge . If you do it'll keep moving for years and years and years no problem, but if you let the two of them sit Aye, got you. They'll seize and that. Aye. They'll they'll weld, they'll weld together Robert and that'll stiffen, stiffen and stiffen as the years go on. Right you are. So just keep that slight Aye. movement in it. Cheers. Okay? Right you are. Okay, cheerio now. Ta-ta. Long fingering of manuscript and I thought the fingering. I now it's putting it on I thought the long fingering of man should was a lovely expression Where was that, you said that? Isle of Isle of oh Isle of and they sh what she went on to say is erm I hope to redress this in the shortly in other words she's shortly going to but I must say I like the expression long fingering you know bloody idle you know. Mm. So you haven't got it back? No, no she said she's gonna redress the balance very shortly. Erm when I find my glasses I Now I've got to leave at three thirty. Okay well we'll Okay Kath, right. Erm let me just see if I've got a I made a whole page of notes here dunno whether any of its important. Erm I've got the Observer Ghost Story winners we can leave that for another week. Erm the talks erm Gillian Thornton is gonna speak to us on the 23rd of February just to remind you and I've actually prepared some notes on play writing which we can fit in some time during this sort of session. Erm homework I'm Come and sit down Janet. Ann Hello, Well let me just say quickly we're being recorded there's there's someone er who's gotta er a project organisation by the Oxford University Press who's interested in our spoken word Right and he's going to ask each of us to sign a a permission form in the end, because we have our we all own the copy right you know our own spoken word and er in order that this man can use what we actually speak today, is showing to want us individually to sign a form. I don't think there's any sort of danger in it it's it's in fact for use in constructing a dictionary really. Erm so it's they're really interested in our use of language. Erm I told you about that chap Michael Bell who wrote to me about using my book as play, I'll read you his letter some other week. Erm John's Dream the National Playwright's Network actually wrote back to me and said they're quite happy to read your plays for a fee erm but I intend to re-write that before I put it in er for a reading erm Oh,I I sent a poem called Pleasure to Woman's Weekly in June last year and I suspect they were actually planning to use it but they've had a New Year's clear-out and I got it back yesterday. Erm Foxes in the Garden with the R S P C A photos I had rejected yesterday as well, so that was a good day. Erm I brought in the old flurry tape,I 've I've taped I taped our when you've read my play for me, I erm I taped it and I made a copy for Dave I you know, erm Cybil makes a good effort in that so eventually I'll lend you the tape. Yeah that's eventually I'll lend you the tape for that erm we can pass it round. Erm Mr. Parish I mentioned, sorry your name is Jim? Jim Jim did you say? Jim and he's proposing to listen to the group today with the views to joining. Jim has written, like myself his background is in technical writing for a living and he's gotta particular interest in American writers and the use of American language er I gather. Right well I'll start today if you don't mind and we'll go round in the normal way erm when we come to Pat. Pat has got five thousand odd words to read to us, so if we can scoot round fairly quickly today. Well we'll leave him till last if he's got Yeah well that's, what I was like that yeah In other words you know you What I was Pat is five thousand words is really too bit a bite you know if you really want people to criticism off it, you wanna break it down into sort of two thousand word chapters really. I couldn't get to the first part again and yeah that's right Even though you you feel it's off your back you've written, you can still read it out I could go er that wouldn't be a bad idea, because part of it would make sense to finish. Yeah well if you like. Yeah. You know five thousand It is quite a lot to read I mean I read a short story last week. Two seven . It was Two Seven and that even seems quite long you know to That's right It's quite long in the reading five thousand is as Yeah as Cybil mentioned you know I mean if if we want to criticise your first ten words it comes a bit hard up to five thousand you know. something that makes sense to carry on Mm Okay Can I just mention that nobody's read that but you'll see the last sentence says that whatever you put on that tape the dictionary keep the copyright you see and that's all right when you're on conversations, but if you were to to read in an and it was a short story, if that's you know i if they reserve Very observant yes, yes but Jim makes the point he said that if if if when you sign a declaration you say Er yeah exclude your short story, otherwise it could mean on you know it could be taken out and sold somewhere and then in interest you would sell your own for selling your own word you know that could be a possibility. Well nobody's really saying in case when any of us sign it, we must sign excluding the written work yes, yes, yeah read out and if you exclude it, I think if all us do that the best thing is to read something we've already had published. Well I think it's something like that Oh, the one that keeps up to date and updates the Oxford English Yeah, I think Even so, I think as David says, it would probably be wise to exclude your exclude your written work. I mean by the piece I'm reading you today, I've already submitted to the B B C and if I sell it if it's something that's If if they they take it, then I've sold the copyright to the B B C and I'm not in a position to offer it to anybody else anyway erm So will the tape last for the whole two hours? Yes, apparently. B B C. Yes. I don't want any of your bad language Janet . Right well let me just surely . This this is I I I'll start off as I say I've I've written a covering letter to Bank and Mitchell of the B B C and I I thought I'd read you the letter as well, because the letter does what train is going at a constant speed of ninety miles per hour how far will it go in two hours ? Hundred and eighty. Right. Do you like teaching us Terry? Yes it's quite erm quite a challenge. Oh yes if I've got a skill to impart I don't mind helping people. How far will a plane go in four hours that has a constant speed of five hundred miles per hour ? Oh one, two thousand miles That's right, good. It's been hot this like summer today isn't it? It's been lovely hasn't it? Mm. And all the bulbs are coming out now nicely as well. Everything's, everything will start growing with the warmth on it. And loads of people are mowing their lawns like summer today. Mm. I in fact mowed my lawn yesterday. Oh. No it was the day before yesterday. It's been hot all the car is going along the motorway at a constant speed. It covers a hundred and eighty miles in three hours. How far does it go in one hour ? Sixty miles. That's right. Write down its speed . Sixty miles per hour? Mm. The 's top speed is two thousand three hundred kilometres per hour no kilometres er, yeah how far does it fly in three hours at top speed ? Oh No, careful. Oh three times That's right. Six thousand nine hundred. That's right kilometres per hour. Yes. No kil kilometres sorry. Kilometres. Yes. It is one thousand and fifty from London to It is what did you say? It is one thousand fi and fifty kilometres One thousand two hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty kilometres from London to? kilometres from London to Veneta Vienna. Vienna . Where's Vienna? Don't know. Italy? No. Oh. Venice is in Italy. Oh yeah it is. Vienna is the capital of Austria Oh! and it's right across the other side of Austria from us. Where you went skiing is this side of Austria, but Vienna is about two hundred and two hundred and fifty miles further on across Austria, very close to erm Czechoslovakia and erm Yugoslavia. Right so it is twelve hundred and fifty kilometres from London to Vienna, can a Concorde do the trip in half an hour ? How far does it go in an hour? Two hundred and Right. thirty. So can it go twelve hundred and fifty kilometres in half an hour? No. How far can it go in half an hour? Erm one hundred and One thousand one thousand an one hundred yeah, yeah fifty and fifty, right, so the answer is no it can only do eleven hundred and fifty kilometres in half an hour. Right, average speed Ha oh Terry Mhm? Will you take me letterboxing one day this week if you can? I don't think it's gonna be possible this week but perhaps in the Easter holidays erm Okay we'll be able to manage it. Yeah. Okay. It is a hundred miles from King's lions King's Lynn. King's Lynn where's that? Erm do you know where The Wash is? No if you think of a map of England erm the south coast is there, there's Dover, there's the estuary for London, London is here erm then it comes up like this, the east coast of London, the east coast of E England like that this is East, called East Anglia, here you've got Norfolk and Norwich and then you've got Ipswich here and then you've got Suffolk there and Essex, right? Can you remember that bulge in the map of England? Well that piece up there is called The Wash Oh. and King's Lynn is close to the wash, King's Lynn is in this area here. Oh. So from London to King's Lynn is, they say, a hundred miles and I'll take their word for it, London to Ipswich in fact is seventy miles. Oh. But, yeah, that's about a hundred miles you see, that would be about right, yeah. Oh. So that's where it is. North of London. Up by The Wash. Right it is a hundred miles from King's Lynn to London, the train takes two hours to do the journey the train does not go at a constant speed, it speeds up sometimes and slows down at other times it also stops at stations on the way and on once of course as it, as it's stopping it's going more and more slowly and as it's er moving off again it starts slowly and starts to go quickly but because it takes two hours in all the train goes a hundred miles in two hours we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour. It says if it was travelling at a constant speed of fifty miles an hour. It doesn't, sometimes it goes more slowly sometimes it goes more quickly, sometimes it stops but because it takes two hours to do the hundred miles we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour. Its real speed changes during the journey sometimes it is more than fifty miles per hour, sometimes less but in two hours it goes the same distance as it would if its speed was fifty miles per hour all the time. Oh. So we say its average speed is fifty miles per hour. There used to be a train called the Cheltenham Flyer there it is it went from Cheltenham to London a hundred and twenty miles in two hours do you know where Cheltenham is? Well if there is the south coast along here and Devo C Cornwall is there and Devon is here and you get the w the Bristol Channel going up here and then you c the coast coming down here and there's Wales is here right? Bristol is there, right? And if you go up from Bristol on from here you go up the motorway to Bristol and then you go along the M four to London well north of Bristol, up where the River Severn gets quite narrow and can be bridged is a city called Gloucester and Cheltenham is just inland from Gloucester. Oh. So Cheltenham is about there, and it's about a hundred and twenty miles from Cheltenham to London. Mm. Right? Okay. So there's Cheltenham. Right so it went from Cheltenham to London, a hundred and twenty miles, in two hours, what was its average speed? Mm Well if it, if it average speed is a hundred and twenty miles in two hours how far in fact would it go in one hour? Sixty. So what was its average speed? Sixty. Sixty miles per hour. Oh It wasn't its actual speed there will be sometimes it will be going very slowly, sometimes it will be going much more quickly but its average speed was sixty miles an hour because at sixty miles an hour it would cover a hundred and twenty miles, which was the distance, in two hours. Oh Right? This book isn't very big is it? No, none of them are really are they? Well this one's very small isn't it? Yeah cos look Oh well you're gonna get on aren't you? Great, yeah, you're half way through. Ha! Only got s nine pages Mm. Right so that was C one, C two it is a hundred and fifty miles from Hereford to London by rail Hereford is north of Cheltenham, it's going up from Cheltenham is Hereford the first train in the morning takes three hours for the journey what's its average speed ? Right Can we go on the computer today? Well there might be time, we'll see how we get on. Now it says B what did you do with th the numbers one hundred and fifty and three to get the answer ? Divided a hundred by three. Right so you write that down, you divided a hundred and fifty by three. I wonder what my brother's doing now. Well at the present moment it's about, where he is it's about half past five, twenty to six, so he is probably waiting for his supper I should think his evening meal. He won't be, he'll have finished skiing now. Mm. Does it get dark over there quick? It probably gets dark about the same time as it does here. It's not dark quicker there now would it? No it would probably be, you know, no it will be about this, be a little bit darker than this. It gets dark, it'll be dark there before it is dark here Mm. mm because it's further east so the sun is further away from them because the sun rises in the east so it gets light earlier that's why we put the clocks on when you go to Europe, one hour. Oh. In America it's loads isn't it? Well in America it's the other way, in America i i it is after us because they are further west than we are. Yeah cos it's about six hours different. Mm, that's right. Right C three I've been to Penzance. I know Yeah. where that is. That's near mile end no what's it called Land's End. Land's End that's right, yes. Yeah. It's right down at the far south west. It's it's more than a hundred miles from us. It's about a hundred and thirty miles from us down to Penzance. So you know we're about two hundred miles from London, so we're about, only about two thirds of the way from London to Penzance. Have you been to L erm Land's End since they've Yes. done it all up? Oh I don't know since they've done it all up, no probably not. It's good there now. Is it? Yeah they show you this Mm erm you go in this place and erm and it shows you all the boats and things, and you can have a go on, there's this thing where they crawl up . And then you go through this door and it's all old like things and then you go and see erm and you go into this place and it's like telling you all the erm history and things like that Does it. and it's got like rocks and things and erm statues doing like erm digging up gold and things a and it's got Oh yeah? erm like a ship Working models? Yeah. And it's got a ship and erm there's people on there and it shows you this thing round the ship erm they have a storm and suddenly the sh the erm what do you call it? The th that big long thing? Mast? Yeah that's it, all fell down and it went like that yeah . And there's lots of other things there as well. Right,Penzance is three hundred and five miles from London by rail the train leaves Penzance at five eighteen A M Ooh ooh and gets to London at ten eighteen AM . How many hours does the journey take? Five hours. Five hours. And B what was the average time speed of the train? Erm five into thirty goes ei si sixty five? No. Oh. What's five into three hundred and Fives into three hundred and five. Fives into thirty goes six Sixty one. Sixty one. Good. Right C four from Carlisle to London is three hundred miles gracious me, you see if you've got a map of England, we haven't got it on here but if you imagine England going up here, Carlisle is right now just think about it if you go out of your front door My front door and you turn left turn left and you go to a junction don't you? Yeah Now if you turn right at that junction The train station! What? If you turn right at that junction, on which road do you go? The no the erm goes to Yes, which road is that? What's it called? I don't know. You don't know! No. If you go out of your f well go out of the gate here and turn right Mm and go across Church Road don't go left down Decoy Road, keep straight on Mm past all the new houses that have been built, past the playing fields Yeah? and you don't know the name of that road? No. It is called Coach Road Ooh! and it is the er it's called Coach Road because that is the road that the coaches used to go along to Totnes Mm. and from Totnes to Plymouth. And it is the old Coach Road. So a hundred and fifty years ago you would have the stagecoach going past here. Were these houses there then? No. No? No. What would of been here? That house might well have been here that big house just there across th in there which has now been turned into flats. Mm. Er I don't know when that was built, it might not have been built but it er it's Victorian so it could have been built like in eighteen thirty soon fa certainly soon after eighteen thirty that would have been built. When were our houses built? About nineteen sixty nineteen sixty six. How old are our houses? Well if they were built in sixty six, and I think they were, they are now, how old are they now? Sixty six did you say? I said I think they were built in nineteen sixty six. So how old are they? Nineteen th eighty something years. No! Eighty four years old. No! Nineteen sixty six, what are we now? Nineteen ninety two. Right, well how many years is that? I don't know. Fifty seventy eighty ni three thirty years? Well ninety six it will be thirty years. So twenty twenty four years? About twenty six years. Yeah! About twenty six years. That's oh I thought they were very old. No. Where have you lived in? Would you a hou the house did you live into it when it was new? No. No? No. I don't know ho certainly I know there had been at least two peo different lots of people living in ours before we moved in, and I would think there were probably more than that. Cos we moved in in about nineteen I think we moved in in nineteen eighty nineteen eighty, nineteen eighty one we moved in. Oh Mm? in the house that she's lived in that she's in now all her life Who? My nan. Your nan. All her life since she was little. She Gracious she, she came g went to the house when she came back from hospital and she's still living in it now. Good lord. Right come on me girl let's get on a little bit. D, otherwise we're not gonna have time to go on the computer Oh! D well yes we can because you can, you can finish it off at home can't you? Yes, right. So D calculating journey times Oh oh look it's got the place. You know there, Poole, is that Yeah no it's not is it? I don't know. Is it what? No cos, can you go across there to France from there? I don't know erm Portsmouth more likely. Yeah that's where I'm going to go Yes. Mm yeah Portsmouth. Oh Portsmouth is here. It's not marked but it's there is Portsmouth. I'm going to France from there. Are you? How long does it take to get to there from our house? Or from What Portsmouth? from Newton Abbott? To, to, to Portsmouth? Yeah. Well, three hours, three to four hours. And then it's eight hours on the boat. I like boats even though I haven't even been on one. Oh do you? Good. Yes. Do you like boats? Don't mind them. You've never been on a big boat? Have you not? Haven't been on a boat I don't thi o only like little, you know, Oh. Oh that's gonna be quite an experience then isn't it? You haven't been to France then? Yes you have, you've flown of course. No haven't been to France. Well you've been to Austria. I've been to Austria, yeah. Yes but you've flown? You haven't done a, been on a boat? Mm. Yeah, no not on a boat, no. Right. It's nicer flying. A motor boat has a speed of four miles per hour this means it goes four miles in every hour Oh. how many hours does it take to go from Lulworth to Bournemouth ? Twenty four hours? No. Oh erm silly me It's twenty four miles. Twenty four miles? And how, it takes a minute a mile doesn't it? No. What does it say it goes? Twenty four miles. Yeah but what is the speed of the boat? Oh! Four miles per hour. Right. Six. Right, six hours. Six hours. How long does it take, how many hours does it take to go from Swanage to Ventnor? Ventnor. Where am I? Swanage Well it tells you how far it is, look Yeah so you can, there's Swanage and there's Ventnor That's in the Isle of Wight. That's on the Isle of Wight. I haven't been there. Have you been there? Yes. Have you been that part there? No Have you been to that part there? No I don't think we landed at Cowes I think we landed over here further. Did you fly? No, went on a hovercraft well wen went on the hovercraft and came back on a, a ferry on the boat. What's a hovercraft? Well it's a very specialized boat in a sense, I mean it goes on the surface of the water and it literally goes on the surface of the water, it's a hovercraft is a sort of a it's a vessel which has got a skirt all round it Is it a rubber one? Yes, heavy thick rubber skirt and that the engines do two things, they, they drive propellers in the air and they pump air from under the vessel onto the surface of the water and the skirt round the boat Keeps dry keeps a cushion of air under the vessel so that really it hovers on top of the water and the air propellers drive it like an aeroplane Oh but it skims across the surface of the water and it's very quick, it only takes half an hour to go from Ramsgate to Dover. Mm! Right er from Swanage to Ventnor is thirty two miles so how long would a motor boat take? Eight hours. Eight hours, right. Colin's dad's got a boat. Has he? And how long would it take to go round the Isle of Wight, which is sixty miles round the Isle of Wight? Er erm fifteen? Fifteen hours, right. Right D two how long does it take to go from Ventnor to Swanage in a launch with a speed of eight miles per hour ? Oh Ventnor, where's Ventnor? Ah twenty two miles four Right. four hours. Right, now you get the answer to D two by dividing the distance by the speed Mm? thirty two's the distance divided by the speed which is eight, thirty two divided by eight is four this is the rule for working out a journey time distance in miles divided by speed in miles per hour gives you the time in hours. Right. You need a calculator. I need a calculator. Ooh How many hours does it take to go seven hundred and five miles at forty seven miles per hour? Fifteen hours. Right. This is fun I like talking into This diagram shows the reach or an airline distances are in kilometres the figures for them are only rough one, a jet flies from Beirut Beirut to to Bombay at four thousand kilometres. Its speed is about eight hundred kilometres per hour Eight hundred and fifty fifty kilometres per hour to work out the time it takes we do four thousand divided by three er eight hundred and fifty. The answer on the calculator is four point seven O five double eight two three hours but we do not need that as that To be as exact as that because the distance is because the d not exactly four thousand miles and the speed is not exactly eight hundred and fifty kilometres per hour . The nearest whole number of hours is good enough. The nearest whole number of hours Do you take it by that number? The nearest whole number to four point seven the wh nearest whole number to four point seven nought five double eight two three is five because to the nearest whole number you look at that four, it's either gonna be four or five depending upon what that number is Mm. isn't it? If that's five or more then you pu increase that by one and make it five. So the journey time is about five hours. So D four work out these journey times to the nearest hour. Bombay to Perth at about eight hundred and fifty kilometres an hour Bombay to Perth eight Hours. Mm? Eight hours, right. Rome to Beirut two hundred and Pardon? Two thousand two hundred Two thousand two hundred, right. Four hours. Right. London to London to Geneva Oh. Geneva. Geneva. hundred and fifty. One hour. Right. It only takes half an hour to go to Austria doesn't it? No, it takes an hour No it takes an hour and a half. Mm, yeah,It takes four hours to get to Lanzarote. Six hours. Good. Right E Now this is quite important, you've got to think about this calculate as work in decimals . But we usually think of time as hours and minutes and seconds too if we are being very exact. This scale shows both minutes and decimals as an hour. Thirty minutes half an hour, nought point five Mm right? Erm fifteen minutes nought point two five. Forty five minutes three quarters of an hour, nought point seven five and all the different calculations in between fifty minutes is about nought point that's nought eight, that's nought nine so it'd be nought point eight one, two Four three isn't it? Just over three. Mm yeah. Right? So it says this scale shows both minutes and decimals and now use the scale to change these to minutes . Now what's point three of an hour in minutes? Ten point No nought point three's there look Mm now you want to read off the top of the scale for minutes. Fifteen minutes That's ten minutes Yeah. that's twenty minutes that's fifteen minutes Mm. what's each of those little divisions? One minute. Right so point three Fifteen minut er fif eighteen minutes. Eighteen minutes, right. B nought point seven five of an hour ? There forty five minutes. Forty five minutes. C nought point four three hours nought point four three Oh! four Nought point four three There That's right, well what's that? Twenty and six minutes Si twenty six minutes. And nought point nought five of an hour? There Mhm in minutes. Three. Three minutes. Then E, change these to decimals of an hour twenty four minutes Nought point four. Nought point four. Fifty one minutes? Nought point eight five. Nought point five, good. Five minutes Nought point nought point nought eight. Right. And thirty five minutes. Nought point five eight. Right. Right well we'll just do this then you can have a go on the computer. The distance from London to Weymouth is a hundred and forty three miles the train takes two hours forty two minutes for the journey Mm? we can find the train's average speed like this change forty two minutes to a decimal of an hour what's that? Nought point seven. Right. From the scale above forty two minutes equals nought point seven hours Mm. that means the journey time is two point seven hours , two hours forty two minutes is two point seven hours Mm. divide the distance by the time hundred and forty three divided by two point seven equals fifty two point nine round off to the nearest whole number that would be? Fifty three. So the average speed is about fifty three miles per hour. Oh. So do the first one here Okay D two, London to Bristol, a hundred and eighteen miles at one hour twenty seven minutes . Nought point f n nought point four five. So one hour p one hour point, point forty five? One point four five Yeah. Nought point one nought. So that's the average speed? Yeah er What did you do wrong? Divided it. Yes, but what did you divide by what? Divided a hundred and eighteen by No you didn't Oh. you divided one point Oh no four five by a hundred and eighteen. Oh. So what have you got to do? Hundred and eighteen Right, divided by by, I've forgotten what it was now. One point four five. Aha! What's that? Eighty one. Right miles per hour. Yeah. Now just for interest's sake do what you did before, divide Okay one point four five by one one eight, equals now that's the wrong way, you've done it the wrong way haven't you? Mm. So push that button Oh! Oh!! It's turned it the other way round. It's the reciprocal button Oh and a half, one over two the reciprocal of a half if you turn it the other way round it's two over one Yes. so it's two. Mm. A half is point five Mm? the reciprocal is gonna be two. Ooh. Right? A quarter Oh haven't we? That one we had first so Oh finish that yeah, yeah just find it in the fridge I bought some ham as well today you know Yeah because I like chicken with Yeah and then some time, these the erm, you know they had some sausage left over, so I thought if I cook them then you know, if you wanted to we could cook the ham Yeah or we can have ham tomorrow Yeah or something, but I cooked Have you got potatoes? Where did I put that? You put it there and I put it somewhere else What's that? The mat? I thought I put it over there, erm I would only want half of these potatoes, would you manage those? Ha, I don't know I'll have one anyway, I'll see then when I, whether I can manage the other half afterwards or not, cos it looks enormous Well they're all big now aren't they? They are, that's right There was one that I had to throw away because it was erm Oh is that so all damaged at one end and I, you know, erm thought I'd cut that away Yeah but in fact it was bad all the way through Mm so , I must confess when I say that we've had bad, like that time when Did you give er Lucy back her English? Mm, mm I thought she was clutching it as she went past here but erm, oh you've had some? No I haven't, I haven't, when you've had yours This is the cheesy one I bought some beetroot the other day, they had some nice little ones, which I must cook, they were ever so cheap, I've forgotten how cheap but you know they were really cheap Mm Now can you see what I did with the lid at them? Yes Oh perhaps I never had it a man came here, from somebody or other double glazing Oh I heard the bell go I thought it might of been Pat sort of at that time, but erm when I looked out I saw a man with a billboard thing One of the little maps in the book shows the Isle of Wight with some towns round the Isle of Wight, and it said Poole so she said Poole, she said the boat sailed from out of France? So I said no Portsmouth oh she said that's right she said I'm going from Portsmouth Oh is she? Oh I said, yes she said, I like going on a boat, she said not that I've been on one she said she's never been on a boat across No I don't think any of them have you see Oh, she's you know, when she's been to Austria of course she's flown Yes that's right so she's erm, quite looking forward to that She is, gave her some of the warnings that er No I didn't actually, but I shouldn't think it great easy to fall off a boat actually would you? No well having said that, if you're fool enough to sit on the side Oh yeah but I mean if you're sitting on a seat or if you've got sort of have the rails Ah, mm, mm, mm looking at the water, I think you would have to sort of climb up over the rails to fall in wouldn't you? Oh yeah, you'd have to perch up on them, sit on them, you know Mm well I mean you know, you know what children are, you never know what they might do I always took the point about the children in the hall didn't they? Mm, mm They hadn't thought about that do you know, I reckon that Sister Josephine erm behind all this, she wanted that hall and she and Father used to talk about this you see they want to extend the church back and do away with the car parking area as well, oh that's alright, but erm sort of can't see any point in it, I mean congregations are going down, they're not increasing, the church is big enough for what is necessary I would of thought wouldn't you? Don't need a cathedral in it Well of course you never know I mean if they close Saint Gregory's I wouldn't of thought they'd do that Mm, I wouldn't, but They'd of more like I would of thought close King Staiton because Saint Gregory's was a purpose built church Yeah but I never forget the way that Doreen when she said we were doing things, she said you shouldn't of started it she said, you'll only get kicked in the teeth at Saint Joseph's Is that what she said? Oh yes right from the beginning Did she really? I didn't know that oh Yes, when we came out here I'll never forget Mark, not even saying thank you, not, not even for raising the money I mean I wouldn't expect that from the parishioners, that's what we should be trying to do, but even for the food and that, till erm Kitty and and the way he got up then and said it, most ungraciously Yes mind you I had to admit, you know me, I know, never have been very impressed with him With him , well for some reason he doesn't like us, well, you say I was thinking, I've been thinking as you know this is the sort of thing that I, gets on to my mind, but I was thinking to myself well really and truly we are so honest people ourselves, we don't go round you know and screw sort of fiddling things, I suppose it comes to hard to us when we discover other people have Yeah but I know Kay wasn't very pleased with Sister about these sort of erm stout things, cos Sister said well if they're not collected by the time of the next jumble, we sort of empty the cupboard and put them all in for erm the jumble sale Kay said to me they're not hers to do that with Mind you No, no, no that was, I mean Kay did what she had to do and sort of got the person Yeah, fair enough to do it, but Sister wouldn't of even have that, she would of just erm, chucked them, but I know Kay put a lot of work into, she's not coming Who's not coming? Whoever is due to come Good evening, hello Richard, mm, mm they have turned it down, oh good Our prayers have been answered tell them Mum says our prayers have been answered mm, good yeah, of course, yeah, oh was it? Oh good, no well, erm, I bet you were too, mm, mm Some justice yet that's right, yes, cos she was thinking it was Friday, oh, you were there were you? Yeah, was there a lot of discussion? No yeah, yeah oh yeah, very good, oh yeah I'm sure you are, jolly good, mm, yeah, fine and there's some, Paul off half term of course, yeah, yeah oh is he oh very good oh of course you're going up to Cardiff aren't you? Yeah, oh well I hope Helen gets on well, yeah When are they going, tomorrow is that? When are you going, when is it you're going? Wednesday, yeah, oh well have a good journey, mm that's right, yeah, mm, mm, okay love thanks for phoning, bye, bye I was thinking of him today, at this erm Planning planning, what did he say? He, it was unanimous Turned down Turned down he said now of course we have to wait and see whether they go to appeal, as, as of course he said they're entitled to do, but er She'd say they've just had a restaurant there, that wouldn't be so bad as a take away But getting back to the finances, I mean the Two Hundred Club over the years it has been in operation, I mean with what it gets this, what they get this year, supposing it's not a thousand, supposing eight hundred, it might even be about eight thousand mightn't it? It might be eight thousand, yeah Mm and I was just wondering if that is your girl who is due to come at a quarter past six then she erm Oh yeah And I thought they were going to the meeting er on Friday because I knew they were both off Mm Are you having any more of this? No thanks, that was very nice Mm, it was weren't it? Yeah I don't know why I've done this whole plate lovely I mean when you consider that the cost of those chickens Yeah somewhere else, mind you they were very cheap ones, where was that? Was it in erm Sainsbury's? I don't know, I can't remember Could of been Mm in Exeter last week, took, made me think about him I think in the fridge Oh leave this washing up, come and have your erm, sweet Oh yeah, well this won't take me a second er, well there's hardly that much to do there actually That's right this thing, this erm, sort of a dinner I think Yeah Alright? Yes, very nice Is it alright, you know quite happy with this? The Father came out this morning to say that the hall could, one of the first things Father told him was that the hall couldn't be insured, I mean it even staggered erm Doris , cos she's not heard of that before, impressed, I don't know what impressed is, but I understand the go upstairs and get erm You see, you there? Yeah jointly insured for major contingencies and potential legal liabilities, the recent re review however has highlighted that we can only insure our own legal liabilities and that we cannot insure or assume responsibility for your prudential legal liabilities This is to the rent is? Yeah hall hired from you for a function injury due to affect the hall itself, E G the floor tile, it is likely that the responsibility for the floor tiling ensuing claim would fall upon us to be dealt with, however you're insured to lack of supervision public liability insurance but you see we can We insure only insure our own league and so it, I mean insured for major contingencies and that I mean you showed that to Father when it was all, cos wasn't there something No I haven't showed this to er, I haven't showed this to No not to Father No Father Michael Oh he gave me this That's right he gave me this to Yeah to send out and I sent it out to all the users That's right but, so they've got some sort of cover Anyway, I think we'd better say well look Yes Father we're too old to be Is that for birds, that fat? Yes Before you throw that water away we need to wash the grill pan now sorry I just ha, see anything else Pardon? apart from anything else we might not be allowed to do anything like cooking or having sort of things to sell like that in the hall Yeah I mean it is, it is ridiculous because we've had that November party down there, and if it does need a bit of planning, you just put the heat on a bit early anyway Well I can't be bothered any more No, I think you just wash your hands, that's it, cos we've done long enough and I mean from say the Sunday thing, I mean we've never ever thought of the Sunday making thing, being a profit making thing have we? No That was always right from the beginning That's right it was always sort of for social thing and pe people couldn't pay well that was alright, they didn't pay as you say, we've done our whack really Too true we have By the way is there anything we need to record, something No is, I mean I have to be out by half past seven, actually, something on half past seven on, you know, on the other programme that'll be worth recording I think, something about There is a ski safety in America Yeah that's right, mm, that's erm what's his name, isn't it? John Stapleton Yeah so we'll certainly record that But is there not something on at seven? No I don't think so, not today On I T V, I make, I make the erm soup sort of peppery have some Right High Wycombe please, John seventy and that could well be, my mad, bad numbers , thank you very much, thank you, bye Hello there you are How are you today? Thank you very much Thank you Thank you A bit thick isn't it? Isn't it just? Yeah, okay Oh you're coming down It's got one of those letters Father gave you, Father Michael gave you Yeah erm on the way it might be an idea to take it down with you Well if I see him I mean I think you could say that while you were only a short time ago Yeah you know and Father's given you this Mm to give to any of our Yep erm well I was gonna come down as you know and sort of do something about the loos, but Oh no what, what I wondered was if you can take some bleach down, I think there's probably some down in the loo downstairs, and at least put some of that into, can you do that? Yeah I can do that And, what are you doing afterwards? Coming back home? Well yeah I mean I'm, I shall go up to the bank but that's all Well I was just wondering, I wanted to go up to, or if you're at the bank you'll be near the income tax office wouldn't you? Mm, mm And if you could pop in there, you know what it is I'm Yes wanting, you know say that I sent away for erm Yeah for erm tax credit you know but, but Yeah okay about three weeks ago Yeah I'll go in to them you know and if there is a form to fill in or whatever Yeah you see cos you've got to get it filled in, in this financial year Right, okay, well I'll go into the tax office then No I cannot see any bleach down there Isn't there some in the nothing in the loo Well do you think you could pop upstairs and look and see if I've got by any chance have I've put, put this heater on which might give us a little bit of, a little bit of warmth Well I don't know, er up in the loft Oh er, I mean you know it's, there looks like some like, it's almost like jumble isn't it? It does doesn't it? Well if there's stuff that's you know, you don't want and it's all right for jumble, I mean if you want it for jumble take it, but if not we'll have it for jumble, I mean you know it's erm It's all the same kind of thing It's all the same sort of thing yeah That's right, yeah What are you going to do about this bottom cupboard? It's gone, it's empty Oh it's empty, you've emptied the bottom have you? Yeah Oh well done Good, all is oh very good There's this, what you see here is actually for your jumble Is it? Yeah Right, okay that's fine that one was intended to go I expect yes that one was intended to go Yes erm is this rubbish here? Oh this is er, not that Cos I mean we might We could of done with a plastic bag under it Well we might be able to put some in a wheelie bin Oh yeah, that's right, yes but shall we get, shall we Let's get, get on with these Yes Oh well What? old semaphore flag eh? Well they're meant No to be but they could of been should of been but they're the wrong colour tis the wrong colour innit? I think that's what, that's what I, I run a school you know for signalling, morse code and semaphore Do you? Yeah, they should be Yeah there should be stripes across red and yellow or blue and white, but still they're I used to know my semaphore I'm, I've never really mastered the morse, but I used to know the semaphore Aha Come to that I mean I can put some of this in the car and dump, just take it over to the tip Er yes alright, let's see how we get on and er, there again absolutely That , that has come off Oh that cabinet hasn't it? it has too, oh yeah, I'll put that back up there Put it back up and I'll nail it up some time when I bring up erm, I'll bring up a hammer I'll put it that way then That's right, yeah see exactly where it is, right, well we're er Shall we, if I go up and hand stuff down will that be the easiest way of doing it? In fact some of this can be thrown can't it? Can I drop that? That looks like a Er yeah drop that Can you manage there? Yeah, alright You be careful won't you? Yeah This can be chucked, I'll chuck it down Alright Old things here aren't there? Really a lot of this is Quite a lot of it almost chucking isn't it? Yeah well that's, that's right I think probably if I can get this in a box it'll be a lot easier, cos it's a lot of loose stuff, that's a saddle, I'll chuck that down, erm, I don't know about these things, but er We'll ditch them those Ditch them I think don't you? Yeah Tell you what, this is a bit of exercise this innit? Yeah , well they say every step you go up adds a second to your life Yeah yeah me too erm er this is, is a lot of school stuff in here, powder paints and paint, I'm just wondering whether being a school might like it, oh I don't know it's empty, that's empty, that's empty, that's empty, no Ah, put it all in with, what's that er Yeah put a use this you know What, oh Yeah you can use this Right that's fine, oh right, great, yes can use it alright, I should be up there on Saturday, I shall load the car up and take them Let me can I Wait a minute You get down a bit lower and I'll drop it down to you Wait a minute, see if I can just You be careful Whoops that's right yeah, erm, I don't quite know what to do about this, this is, I've taken some stuff out, if I can slide it down the Yeah If you, if I hold this at least until you get a bit down Yeah, I don't, wait a minute, wouldn't you want this for your own kitchen window?

Before the war people would of screamed out for that Well I mean people say, you know, there's, there's so many poor people about, but there's no, there's not the poverty there was oh Right, that's it, that'll do, I won't go any further and I can get the other things in well we had er, we had an aluminium friend, a double glazed enormous window over our landing and it was, the aluminium was so cold and it was conden there was so much condensation that we had a new window P V C put in, but I tried to sell this other window, cos it was beautiful you see, nothing wrong with it except you know, but nobody wanted it and I kept it and I had it for about two years standing outside and then I thought I can use that and I cut, it was a three section, three lots of glass all in one, cut down, divide it into two and one, and got myself a plant house under the erm Yeah under my verandah Yeah, yeah er right I think we've finished Have you got to go to the tip? That's it Yes Alright, leave the car there just for a bit I want to go over and see the dentist just for a minute Right alright?

A beautiful bank full of them. And you see they say that erm snowdrops really want The best way to sort of erm increase them is just sort of pick out a lot of those and then put them in another part of the garden. yes yeah. They, they're two ninety? Mm yeah Should be nice fuchsia there fuchsias. Forty nine pence each or four fifty for ten. Oh yes. It was three fifty for ten. Mm someone's scarf? Yes mm child's by the size of it. Thank you very much. That's the second person that's c said that in the last three days would you believe ? Yeah Now what was that that went behind us? I thought it was a little er blackbird. Oh was it? Mm. I w I would have said it was an animal, you know? Didn't, didn't fi Oh yes Erm you wear it Right you're Oh isn't it nice? skiing. Oh yeah Right Let me get my broth back. Oh Oh we'll go back home if that's alright. Unless you want to go somewhere else. No I, I was just sort of erm A wondering and B wondering whether to go back a different way round and Well it's up to you cos I'm quite happy to go have that little walk, I wanted a little walk. But that's enough? Oh no no no, I mean I'm alright if I sort of get on a a straight because oh these that are coming out Mm that is out. No I'm alright as it happens, so that's okay. it's still okay left if you want to nip over oh back this way. Mm Did you hear Christopher saying that he was going to be getting erm a new Cavalier? Yeah. Having, having booked it that morning That's right, it was twenty pounds cheaper was it now? Was he No it was twenty pounds a month less. Twenty pounds a month less was it? Mm. Oh I thought it was more than that. They hoped it would get through. He says he was gonna have to get something anyway wasn't he? Yeah oh yes. Sort of a yellow Yes tinge to that, don't know Oh look Yeah, there's a rugby pitch there, I didn't know there was a school there. that's one of those erm handicapped Is it? . David could have gone to it. Remember your mother taking David up to Birmingham way where they had erm big new Oh I thought it was me making all that noise. I was breathing and I could hear sort of I was thinking first of all it was coming from, you know somewhere outside like somebody sawing a tree or something. Widening the road here or something. Yes, just widening it and straightening out some of the bends. cos that was a bend there wasn't it, obviously. Mm. Gosh the valley goes really far down there. Yeah it is deep down isn't it? one or two houses, you know, when I caught sight of it first I don't see them now. He must have been fishing. Looks like it doesn't it? He's got a big keeper net there. Was the disabled toilet alright? Yeah Nice little waterfall things. Yes, a weir. It's good to have those on the ground, you know, for people who are gosh who are you know incapacitated. But sometimes people think well they're only for disabled but I don't believe that's so No I don't think it is either. because I think to myself well you know if there are no disabled people about, and more often than not there are not why shouldn't anybody use them? That's it. Yeah we're going past. Mm big erm tree tree that's making it fall down yeah. The thing is beginning to look you know light comes They're gonna get, yes through it. that's right. had to take a sort of erm south to erm not just thought of both the names and the other one but they would be nearer to Exeter but it wouldn't be sort of in Exeter itself I was thinking, you know, probably get erm you know, see if there's any new houses being built there and what sort of price and what have you. Yeah. I'm not quite sure where you mean. Well it's sort of on its way to Exeter. Chudleigh Chudleigh Mm we haven't been through this way for a long time have we? No we haven't. I could certainly do with a drink. Could you? Mm. Well I suppose it's not far to go home for a well it'd be nice if we saw somewhere that was nice. Or do you know somewhere? No I don't know anywhere, no. The The Olde Lion, don't think we'll go there. open for lunch and dinner. The Coach The Coach House House Funnily enough I was going to say to you when we were out at erm Dartington instead of buying that ice cream, we should of had a cup of tea probably would of been about the same price, and so Yeah. Probably the tea would of been better for us. Small development, that must, that must be down there somewhere. But you see practically anywhere here would be within Christopher's Yeah erm you know, distance into Exeter. I mean he was saying that er erm what do you call him? Yeah he lives in erm in, in No it's warehouse units going up there, I thought it was gonna be housing, more houses. Oh there i there is new housing, you know, there's more Mm. development er back there, that's what made me think of it. They wouldn't want to be near warehousing units of course but erm there's a lot of new building going on and with so much competition Thinking of Imelda for a job, I mean there's, there's loads of places here as well for her Exeter Hospital you know the Torbay. Somebody mind you was on about Torbay this morning on the radio I think it was saying that there were so many complaints and nurses are under such great stress. And I was very naughty I, I felt like saying well some of their, they, them aren't er do you remember the very last time we were up in the hospital at the waiting area, there was those two nurses that walked up and down Mm mm about five times doing nothing. That's right. So really and truly I mean it's not all nurses that are so stressed. I'm sure there are some who are you know, are in a bad way and they're having to do other things that they shouldn't be doing. But this is the trouble with everybody these days isn't it? Yeah. Everybody just wants to do what they should be doing whereas with my job it never even thought about it did we? No, no. Tell you what erm when we get into you can just drop me down to the greengrocer near the church because I'm out of erm spring onions and if I wanted to add up to that bit of salad that we've got Right. tonight, if you're gonna have that, oh I can have a bit some other night then Mhm But this week is the last that we can go to the erm Beefeater and get that Oh ha have you got that voucher still? yeah Oh. off the cost of a meal. And then you get half of a bottle of wine as well or something. Got double lines coming up that's funny stuck there like that Well I didn't sort of notice what it was. Oh it was just two Oh I see, well some signpost, yeah poles for a signpost see them? Yeah I can just see them in the rear mirror. Oh could be for a signpost, yes it could indeed. red car's coming, coming as well. And another one as well coming. Oh he was far too close you see, he was far He's going to tr she, he or she is going to try and go now. he was far too close to it and he didn't see what was happening you see. The other car did. He is telling it to go now look, you see he's put on his lights. Yeah Wonder why the police car put its lights on at that moment. I don't know but erm Oh you were quite legit Oh I was legit, yes, nothing wrong with me. I was well clear. Yeah. The other one's not in sight, the whole of that straight. It never came did it? No. But I think the, the tractor driver put on his lights Yeah to say it was clear. I was thinking when Daniel was down here that erm Paul you know and all his girlfriends, various girlfriends, for a long time now and I said something to Daniel well you know are you sort of courting yet? No no, he says no, no No. And I don't think Tim is very interested. I think there's many more women driving now aren't there? If you look. Yeah. going round anyway so she's going round as well Well I think I'll go round actually cos they're queuing up,we want to go to the grocers so er if we go up The Avenue we shall just come past the front of it. Colin something or other? I forgot in that second what it was Yeah always happens to me. It was Colin somebody. It is well worth going down Yeah. I should think in this day and age they could Now there look at that lot as well. I mean it's amazing isn't it? All on to one post. Yeah. I think this building is dreadful for the poor people living in those houses just behind it. Mm. Oh but this is the erm council office as well isn't it? well there's in gonna be income tax isn't there amongst other things. their light and their view and everything, I think it's dreadful. And it would, I mean they, they wouldn't of even had expensive houses anyway but they must have taken their value away tremendously. at the back of the houses there but erm There's that and then there's students doing the exam right, two things first of all I mean I think this is the first one and once Napier get it up and running I think it's exportable yes but I think when you look at how it's structured and whether it's modular structure and its content it's got to be written that it will be United Kingdom exportable not merely sure I mean yes Napier have Well I think it's been open to any higher education institution to grab this idea because it's been around for a long time, the great beauty of Napier is to some degree it's a centre of excellence it's got its B A course so has Queen Margaret but at the bottom end but why should I say the bottom end at the bottom end it's got the B A communications course at the top end it's got apprentice training for printers. So everything's there, printing presses repro separation houses, sheet film, computer set up and Apple Macs and everything is there, it's actually a very impressive set up erm, the Queen Margaret's course, I'm slightly dubious about I once had a colleague I'm going back a decade who had been employed on the basis of doing the communications course at Queen Margaret I think, and it turned out that it wasn't communications as we understood it, it wasn't our sort of communications P R newspapers and things like that, it was communications on a much broader, broader front so it didn't actually fit in to the world of P R and what happened was I then had to sit down and train this woman from scratch and get rid of a lot of the preconceived notions that she had come in with she had brought from Queen Margaret's College. I mean I've had Fife College on the phone as well saying you know why can't we do it and Alec we're really now we can do no more until Napier come up if for some reason Napier fell down on the job then I think I've got enough knowledge about what we're doing now but I would start running it round the other colleges including Telford who are doing a distance learning course Oh yes but they've been doing distance learning course they've got the biggest distance learning course in Europe Yeah but they're doing the distance learning course at the moment on publicity and P R I think erm I had some papers about that somewhere well this is the open learning opportunities here they've got erm various things including the communications and so on right they're doing an H N C in communications for business and there are modules in that that would actually suit some of our who have you met down there I haven't met anybody they mail shot us um I thought I'd brought it with me cos I've met I've met with them before aha on some of their things and in fact two of their people came to the intellectual property thing right so I think in a way it would be quite nice to sit down with somebody from each of the colleges to hammer out the syllabus because Napier will see it from Napier's point of view about what's easiest for them to teach and what this and what the other whereas I suspect if you also sat down with and and people you might get a broader discussion base I have a built in um caution of those who wander in the groves of academe I always feel they're a bit divorced from the real world I don't think you would I certainly don't think you would find divorced from the real world because he's involved in consultancy work and research work with the national companies out with the organisation I'd like to see what hard nosed er B A I E people would make of it you know people who are making a living from doing the same well you know when I employ somebody coming into the business this is what I want them to be able to do um this has always been of course an a criticism yes could we sit down and write the two of us some pages to put to this next meeting so that we have actually got some meat in front of us? Well we could try and do that my I've got a workload that would choke a camel at the moment because I'm also the admin officer at the moment for the Public Relations flight of the R A F E R. Because of a lecture I gave last weekend I've to write a paper on how P R audits can be applied to the military which is great fun and an acknowledgement that people of a senior level were listening to my lecture but, um it's put quite a bit of work on me. But by all means if you've got something bring it along and that would give us a starter for five I'm keen to see us also trying to once we've got this going going down the S P Q road ah had lunch with the other day at I mean it was I mean she wasn't meeting him necessarily wearing a B A I E hat of not um and I think she I think she touched on that though while while while they were lunching. erm I put down progress because I was thinking of the Pilgrims Progress at the time erm Yes it's quite interesting I mean the if you go and look at the computerised facility that I'd found about communications training, there are something like three hundred and ninety two sources of training in Scotland. Those obviously include all the further education colleges that do the basic um and the basic things and then the H N C H N D it gives you the open learning things which includes then the private sector people communicate and all sorts of other agencies, erm it depends really what you see as a beginner, do you mean a beginner in the communications field in its entirety, or do you mean a beginner as an in-house industrial editor or a freelancer by definition a beginner is not likely to be a freelancer? Aha That's right, it would be somebody of one rung down perhaps from and half a rung down from if you can put that in context I mean is an absolute beginner she knew nothing about this business two and a half years ago What had she done before she came to you? She was the office junior right And she had one or two hires including higher art and then somebody said oh that would be good for the P R department is looking for staff so she now is doing a superb job running a marketing operation, editing an internal newspaper it all herself and erm all of that I taught her, now I want to move her on to the stage where she can get professional recognition for this, now that is what I call an absolute beginner yeah so do the certificate to do the certificate yes and then with great rapidity after that the diploma so that she could be erm do you know I'm still foxed about saying to do it well but the important thing is she's engaged to be married I would reckon by the time she's about twenty-six she'll be looking for time out to have a family but by that time hopefully she's and when she's thirty-two or thirty-three can come back into the business and say I've got a and the door opens that much more easily Of course, I mean the government view is that people will come back with S V Q's and that is what's going to do it. Being certainly lost an opportunity by not being it's only body there is an editing element in the book publishing section from the P G B and there are elements relating to us in the S P G of the Periodical Training Council and there will be bits of them in the public relations in the marketing one of which I've got a copy of the draft, but you know there is nothing all embracing B T E C do graphics and journalism but there is no single forum, I mean that's what so astonishing and interestingly somebody at B T E C told me the other day there's been a bit of a problem about the the book editing part of the editing level three element um, and that's partly political as to editing versus production because production's level four and editing is level three, and that has made some problems apparently right, right what I see as an interesting possibility the papers that we got in this week from Telford College that came to me About open learning About open learning and they've got an H N C in Business Communications, now they also say that you could do this as a student at the college. There are three elements of that that fall within the scope of B A I E type learning one is an interviewing technique, one is an introduction to public relations yeah interviewing in terms of staff interviewing I don't know it was a two liner, um an intro an introduction to marketing and P R and an introduction to internal communications were talking about you know the house newspaper, now that's the and this is distance learning? yeah yes This is three elements out of about nine or ten, now if they could be persuaded that if people phoned us up and said blah blah blah I want to learn this we could say well Telford will let you do this one unit of the course, they learn the one unit of the course, they say right I'd now like to learn about let's say photography and we find out that Queen Margaret's College in their course have an element on photography so we point the student in that direction and then they do this hold on a second but you can't you can't dip into modules of that can you don't you have to do the whole thing? Why can't they dip into modules because once they've learned that they then come to us and we say right you're at the stage where you can do the certificate in Industrial Editing sit our exam But I think the difficulties buying into sections of an H N C course Well that would be up to the colleges, if they're commercially astute they'll say right yeah twenty-five quid for that, in fact it would be a lot less because it's only for three months but I don't think, I don't think I think you have to pay a candidate fee as well as the course fees so you right, well that's the sort of things that I think we want to find out and in slower time I was actually going to ring the yeah at Telford and say speak to me about this and maybe pop in one morning on my way into town and just say this is the idea how does it grab you and if they say you're not on fine, but it's things like that that I think we want to explore. Napier have said that once they get this course up and running there's absolutely no reason why experienced people like us can't dip in and out for a one off ya the other people who I think would be quite interested at looking at something like that would be the new Business Development Centre at Queen Margaret I think that's much more up their line is this erm is this Ann Packard enterprises this? No, no no this is them wanting to get off a course off the ground right in fact the girl who did the mailing for them didn't do it properly so in fact it's unlikely to happen erm they asked me because I know that since she's now leaving the Vice-Principal through network erm and and they were thinking of getting something together like that, I didn't write this that's not my writing but just let me tell you I don't write a twenty- four clock, twenty-four hour clock with full stops in it aha right it's a bit odd isn't it? erm so no certainly they asked me about it and so on but I think that rather like their food forum they might like to get a communications forum going erm because they've been thinking about having a Business Club and various other things because they're involved with the Management Programme and all sorts of things and they maybe going to do some training for heads and people like that I mean this is something that we could maybe be of help to in fact maybe something that I could be of help to them on because I actually do lectures on public relations how to assess what I mean at a very basic level you want to communicate with press how do you do it but before you do it why do you want to do it. Have you made up your mind what your message what've you got to tell the press this is how you go about targeting I know I had to explain to somebody in Chambers the other day something to do with the Corpus that it wasn't where was the story there wasn't a story right erm people get great ideas we want to give this a big show at the press to which I say well ho ho ho step back but they are going to be running short courses there about well, if they were interested in speaking to me I could probably put them on to not just myself but members of my flight, it isn't my flight it's flight erm and there are several of us in Scotland who could come in and do things like that for a modest remuneration erm ya, they're feeling their way it's only been open I mean you know well is probably just about to become a member of our flight I mean he's going through he's just about to go to the R A F College in Cranwell yes to do what? There is a specialist Public Relations Flight in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserves yes and in the Air Force Reserves he's just about to come into it Oh really Yes He's the young lad who was at S T D he's now working for himself that's right, that's right and now that he's shaken off the Scottish Office I invited him to come along to it as well so we may find but how do you I mean do you have to be taken on as officers of the R A F You have to go through a short course at the R A F College Cranwell and then once that that teaches you the R A F side of it makes you into an officer because at the end of the day you maybe there to do public relations but if the spaghetti hits the fan you're an officer and you're a combatant and you know you carry a gun around when you're in a war zone and you know you're expected to use it and if the senior officer of the unit next to you gets shot and you're the most senior officer then you take over you're then commanding the unit it's always a bit a it came home to me with great a vigour and enthusiasm when I was walking round the kitting station at R A F Innsworth with a supermarket trolley getting it filled with kit and when I got to the end they handed me my dog tags and my gun, I thought what have I let myself in for because I'd never worn dog tags before and I'd never had a gun with live ammunition in it that got strapped to my hip and you suddenly realise, I'm going into a real war it was quite a nerve racking experience for a few days But had you had presumably training in all these things oh I trained in all of these things yes where did you do your training here or down Catterick usually Oh really, yes with the R A F regiment yes um I mean that's where we do the military side of things in fact I'm just organising that now for the flight for February but we have the probably the most famous member of the flight for it was founded in nineteen forty was H E Bates Oh really erm now I was reading about him a few days ago that's right because they've just released papers after thirty years of work that he was doing for the M O D he was actually doing it in his role as a member of the P R flight, Beaver Brooke sold the government this idea just so can we get back to research about beginners because I'm worried about how much there is on the tape and you're about to drive to Pitlochrie erm basically you have to define a beginner to see what they want to do sure that's right but I mean I think the beginners are the people coming in new to the bis when you say new to the business do you mean new in terms of employment as opposed to say graduates from Queen Margaret or Napier or anywhere else? I would say in employment yes, or people that want to get employment example would be yeah at M D secretary suddenly shot into the job of producing the company newspaper now I mean somebody like very quickly has to get to grips with this obviously cannot give up six months to go and do it so you do it on a half day release basis. but she's had quite a lot of training in other things actually and with the man marketing department that they've got there they might not need that the thing coming up I've just had what's interesting about that and what I don't like about it is not to because I have a lot of respect for her. But they don't tell you who is actually doing the delivering so you're buying blind There is nothing here either that I see that is immediately um relating to the B A I E type of business effective writing skills, presentation skills and working with the media I've got here Thursday twenty second nineteen ninety four Now I've got here ah learning outcomes erm some topics preparation and agenda type management issues the meaning control skills that doesn't well time management could be for a lot of people yeah that was something people had asked for working for the media here but it wouldn't er now you've got a different programme to me, I've got Learning Outcomes again is that the same one? No this I've got the I've got this is right I've probably that one no that's just the I really just wanted to see er just wanted to see the sort of range of things they did now this is more like it you see Effective Writing, Report Writing, Technical Report Writing, Business Sales Corres , Editing House Journals Writing for Publication, Desk Top Publishing, things like working with the media these are more the sort of things that I would see people Oh that's for in-house training for actual customers in their own organisations isn't it? sure but again I mean if there was a market for this I am sure that to take that and splinter it off into a unit it costs money to get people that want to come into this business but the interesting is I was talking to one of the training people at one of the big finance houses recently about whether or not one could piggy back on some of their courses or whether in fact some of the in-house stuff they do they would like to deliver to external B A I E people right so that's something else to look at, but it takes time but I've got this C I T B N V Q stuff really to sort of to see what went into an N V Q's package well if you'd like to come to Dunderth Street one day you can see twelve inches of it I see erm it also misheard me here because I'm involved in designing a television series as well on the construction industry also gives me some interesting data about the industry was it ten per cent of the nation's workforce works for the construction industry which in an average year will turn over thirty five billion pounds well the industry C I T B industry training board premises are just near one of my sister's houses erm in Norfolk isn't it in Norfolk somewhere? yes Kings Lynn Kings Lynn well you drive through it on the main road and it goes both sides of the road I've never been to Kings Lynn Can I ask you em age R A F me please to complete the form thank you fifty two thank you sex, we think you're male, accent, do you have an accent?

Here, above the garage. Have you any money? I'm not and I bought last night! Meaning, you bought last night, you never! Yes, I bought the Coke! Listen, you big shit! The er is so stupid! I get . Where's a book? There it is. Do you Go over want a beer or what? and read the book. Go on over to daddy and read the book. Come on and I'll you read you the story. No. Ah! Ah, ah, ah! Ah ah, oh! Ah ! Alright. Ah? Ah? Hard. Come here ! Oh oh! Sorry, you'll have to wait for daddy's clear. What? What? Brilliant these hand brushes! Yeah. You going to bed Lianne? Yeah. Are you going to bed love? Yeah. Yeah. Daddy. What love? Yeah. Yeah. You going to bed? Come on! You going to bed? Come on! Are you going to bed? You wee crab! You wee crab! Aren't you a crab! What? You say it to her. Are you going to bed Lianne? Yeah. Bed. in previous years and management teams haven't grown in that sense, but the responsibilities of management have been increased. And we're not doing yet the things that it was planned that we'd be doing of in a year. We're not financially responsible but we were No. expecting to be but you know, how, how could you be Mm without any additional I mean Mm. the argument of m the lesson of my project is, that without an accounts technician full time here Mm. forget it. Mm. Erm and I suspect much, you know if you're going to be financially down there, unless you want to get involved in double entry bookkeeping because you're transferring money from one fund Yeah. to another, which is what we're supposed to be able to do. Mm. Without a part time temp accounts clerk Mm mm mm forget it. Yes I agree Yeah. with you there. So I think i it'd be, I can see it being a big pitfall if we got into too much of a discussion in relation to this, about management time Mm. because we could end up spending too much time on that But yeah at the expense of actually looking at, at mainline Yeah. staffing levels which is what Yeah I mean I hope all, I will be able t all I will do is say well we've got about fifty bloody criteria here. Yeah Erm I'll make up a spreadsheet with twenty five or thirty blank columns, but with all the formulas in place Yeah. and we'll decide which ones we want, and I'll just delete all the remaining empty Yes ones. Do you want the data to go in? I think we've gotta r Yeah. until we can meet and agree. Yeah. Some of the da all of the data I've g I can get I will get. Right. Yeah. Which is the stuff we've had pre before, most of which was centrally collected, yeah? Yes yes. Erm the r everything else is, is, is an area of debate isn't it? Yeah. Really. I mean even the simple things, the hard data like annual mileage, is clearly an area of debate because you and Cynthia would argue different points you know. Mm mm. But what about things like post sixteen special needs? The thing about post sixteen special needs is, it's like F E. It doesn't happen where the clients live. Mm. Does it? No. So you know do you get all the credit for it, because it happens in institutions in your division? Or does somebody else get the credit f or does the credit apply equally because everybody deals with their own at home? Mm Or do you get a weighting because everybody's dealing with their own, but you're actually dealing with the institution, and Mm. probably get some of their work? I mean Yeah. that's theoretically simple hard data. H I mean I'm really talking about the high number of post sixteen special needs people Gail has, has to see that I mean they probably exist in other Mm. offices as well, but erm, and I know she's half time and some offices have only got a quarter, but as I say, she's the busiest person I know and, and she's Yeah. very efficient. Erm what would you suggest for r for, what would we do to address that? Well in one sense I, I would like to see Jane addressing it, because she can do it from a non-divisional point of view. Oh sorry yeah I mean in terms of how, what numbers do we Erm in terms of numbers? Yeah. Well I, I think to t we could try and make an assessment of the case load, special needs post sixteen case load in ter and we'd have to do it in terms of the work we actually do. Yeah but Because but Yeah. erm there isn't one in Northern Division. Right but th th So there's no case there's no re no numbers. Well isn't there? If they're saying they work with people that are post sixteen and a special need, then they'll have to identify those people and have to say, but th the Yeah but if you haven't got anybody in the post Right. If we h right. Oh sorry. I understand what you mean And we haven't had any post since last , yeah that's, what I mean is Right, but presumably if that, that work's not just going by the board that's, that's right No it's being done by other members of staff. Yeah. So I mean in terms of identifying So if the staff the mem the post, Yeah. and what that post case load is, everybody can't do that uniformly. Yeah. But the total numbers of people F E, with special needs, seen in the division Mm. regardless of who they're seen by, that's hard data. Mm. And you could then if you wish say well we've got point five of a post, and that person saw eighty percent of those or ninety percent or Mm. whatever. Mm. Erm and if in another division they saw another number erm but their, their particular post only managed to see twenty percent, erm well that tells that the Mm. consumers are not getting specialist services Mm. for example and Mm. there's, there's got to be a reallocation. Yeah. Er I'm quite happy to include the case loads erm of special needs C Os. Erm Yeah. no I just don't want to exclude anything No. that people feel are an issue cos together we have to exclude it. It's just finding a way of Well let's put, case loads active. Yeah. Erm special needs C Os yeah? Yeah. And I'm not talking about Not the specia not the specialists. senior No. it's the special needs Yes. so not Yeah. senior. Yeah? Mm. Yeah. I mean how, how we're gonna get all the numbers I don't know but, but I mean that's a, when I think we see what people are arguing, Yeah. what their people's cases are. I mean I think at the end of the day because we're w going to have to basically in a sense your job I think even though at the moment you're saying you know fine I'm not gonna exclude anything, I think it's actually going to be sort of, to try and eliminate most of this. I think so yeah. Because at the end of the day I think that a although it's quite significant in terms of workload we might be able to address it elsewhere I mean I think the yeah. special needs thing can be addressed Yeah. in a slightly different way. I think the management thing can be addressed in a different way erm excuse me erm, oh I've lost my thread now but, oh yeah that's right Yeah. in terms of when you're taking so much into consideration, the actual lo loading or weighting of that factor would actually s turn into dr into something very insignificant in terms of weighting I think. Yes. I mean Paul's proposal was to have a spreadsheet of hard data Mm. but we're obviously, we've got debate about what really Yes s is hard data now. To which we add a whole series of other factors that we then kick around and argue over. Mm. So we, so we distribute the staff based on the hard data and then you make cases based on other factors. Yeah. Erm and if you and Ray make the same case, then you and Ray have to fight for the Yeah. share of resources, if it doesn't apply to any others. But if Mm. everybody makes the same case Yeah. then either we ignore it or we, well we'd have to ignore it wouldn't Mm. we? Cos we're another four Mm mm. of staff. Mm. So yeah small number of factors in the sheet, and then supplementary debate items. Mm. And maybe issues that are, that are dealt with in a different forum completely but erm Yeah. Yeah? Right okay. Just remind me again whether a goes towards the bottom or Networks links, N Y B E C, work experience, Mm. the number of schools in a division, erm Yes. Y T, everything in Y T Yeah. C L As, clerical to management, mileage to schools, management time as you said. Yeah so all of those things Economy to scale is another one, Deborah, you need a minimum number of staff erm to service a location. Yeah. I mean it's interesting I mean Cynthia raised that point yesterday, to which the answer, I mean I'm afraid I have to say th th the glib answer is, why are you telling me you need a minimum number of two members of staff at lunch time, for a full time office in the centre of town, surrounded by bloody phone calls, in school buildings, when you send one single member of staff aged twenty one, Mm. to Stokesley, who if she screamed through a bloody bullhorn wouldn't be heard by anybody? Yeah. You know erm I don't know whether that, I mean I think that's going to be another area of considerable debate Mm. how many people Mm. do you need. Erm to be honest it's no good saying you need two members of staff every office, on health and safety grounds. Mm. Or consumer satisfaction grounds cos we haven't got 'em. Mm yeah. We can't, we can't say, can't erm really just contradict ourselves like that can we? No. I, I think it's an interesting No, I don't mind the contradiction but argument because Yeah. I think you can, I, I've, the same argument has occurred to me in relation to special schools. Where there might be a very small number Mm. that almost regardless of the number, you've actually got to do a certain amount You've got to, you've got to physically go there two or three times, you've got to form the agreement. relationship with the school even if there's only one person there. Yeah exactly. Erm erm I, I think that you know I, that had occurred to me in the past Mm. that we should actually look at a ce a minimum Yeah. number of days per institution and then the weighting over and above that is on the number of pupils, mm. F for number of pupils, yeah. What's a m I mean we could easily say it's I don't think it's you know it's go you could easily say it's a minimum of three days Yeah. just to introduce yourself, meet the staff That's right that's right. start the agreement and finish the agreement. Yeah yeah. And that is including I think in terms of schools it only really applies to special schools, I think once y even in some of the small independents, once you get over about forty or fifty, then you're gonna have enough contacts Yeah. anyway Yes. Yeah erm to keep the thing going. But Yeah. certainly with some of the specials, especially where the numbers fluctuate so much from Yeah. year to year, Mm. to maintain the relationship. Yeah, and of course you know when you've got a specialist school that is one site special, special education needs pupils, nursery, primary, secondary, Mm. all in one school. Mm. Erm that causes problems as well. Mind you more for the governors but hard luck. So all of these are the factors that Yeah. people have come up with I'm gonna simply list every single factor Yeah. on a single sheet I hope yeah? Provide Yeah. a magnifying glass. I will asterisk those which I believe are s the simple raw data that Paul referred to, and the remainder are the Mm. you know the, the supplementary debate items Mm. but which have to come with numerical evidence. Yeah. Yeah. So really if we did agree that any of those supplementary factors were going to be significant. And they'd only be significant if we were expecting a significant disproportion anyway Yeah. erm then we would actually go, have to go away from that meeting on the nineteenth and c and come back with that information Yeah. for you to process. Well unless I, I ask you beforehand you know Yes. I circulate this beforehand. Yes Yeah. So we come prepared. Which would be the best thing. Yes. One of the other things you talked about briefly yesterday, Cynthia and I, was er Cynthia believes that Northern Division operates in a radically different way to other divisions. Mm. And sh there are a number of reasons that she believes that. Erm but we were also looking, I mean we were looking at you know how many staff you need a minimum number of staff, economies of scale. Now i d in our debate we, we had separately actually come up with very similar f processes. Erm which was to, to audit what staff were required to run a division in a month, of four weeks Mm. or a statistical month, I mean a month of four weeks is probably easier. Erm so we were saying for example, and this is what we, we'd actually come up with, the five days of the week, and the three categories of staff, I mean I've just obviously put erm C L As are in either C L or E O really Mhm. I mean they're C O really in terms of grading and what This in terms of th er the careers centres rather than in Yeah. terms of servicing schools or anything like that it isn't N no everything. Oh it's everything? Yeah Ooh God right. so, oh no sorry this was in centres. Yeah? Yeah. To staff the North Northallerton office. Mm. The way the standards require it to be we need the following numbers of staff. And we had to do it over a week and over a month because some weeks you do things that don't do Yes. the previous week. Erm Thirsk, Richmond, Leyburn, Stokesley and in the whole, and that's a hundred percent. Mm. Erm and then see how many we'd got. You know Mm. you need that. Mm. And how many we'd actually got. Mm. Erm and part of the problem's always gonna be there's part time staff who Mm. for a variety of reasons only work certain days. Generally speaking those days are agreed by the member of staff's needs rather than the organizations interviewed Or they're historical and you can't change them, yes. Or historical, yeah. Erm or they're related to attendance at meetings you know er no Mm. good saying, your job is Tuesday and Friday Mm. but actually we have a meeting every F every Monday Mm. afternoon Mm. so I mean we've got more people in on Mondays Mm. not because that's the best day for them to be in to do their work, er it's not, erm but because that's when the meeting is. Yeah well we had, we had to abandon that, we brou we brought all our Employment Officers in on a Friday, erm and we just couldn't staff the office the rest of the week you see Yeah I know. It's gone by the board and I have to confess we've not had a I think a meeting of me proper meeting for a long time. an hour a week meeting is means that there's not adequate communication Mm. in the office, doesn't Mm. it? I, I'm going to have to have more than one meeting and let people, say you've got to come to one or the other and have them at different times during the week. Yes. I mean I, I, there is actually an argument for having one meeting, everybody knows when it is and where it is, and if people feel they're being left out or not b getting informed they should make the case that I am Mm. not being informed. Or if Mm. it's evident that they're not informed because they're not doing what they're required to do, Mm. erm they, we have make sure they get n get told. But Yeah. we can't have Yeah. I can't ha I can't function on inflexible everybody comes in for an hour. We've got certain mi amount of erm the factor where people will say well I, I'll swap that week because there's a meeting Yeah. I'll come in the morning instead or whatever, erm but quite often it means if they're coming in they say, well I'll be in town anyway I'll come in for that hour Yeah. Th they're building up flexitime which Yeah. has got to be taken off at some other time erm B and one of the issues that we're talking about is operational matters, not all of which is a matter for open debate so Mm. they're there to be informed Mm. of a management decision. Yeah? Mm. Erm so as it's not an open debate to produce a decision, very often, and it will be less so I imagine, erm they don't need to be there to listen to this debate. So they need to be there t to hear the answer. And the method that we're going to use. Well those that are there can do that and contribute to some extent. Those that aren't will have the minutes, yeah? Mm. Or clear instructions that are doing something else when I'm doing my own work. Okay in the easter holidays Okay now We have like twenty five a test and then these must be another test for another group. Okay what do you think of these words? Erm some are Could you quite easy Okay so some are quite easy some of them you're not going to have much problem with at all. You Mhm. already know them or you could have a good guess at them. Erm it may be some will be not so easy need a bit more work and some of them'll be sort of in the middle. Yeah. In between. So which are they easy ones? The easy ones are erm use puppy key desk kept use used. Yeah. Okay so you could do all of those you don't even have to bother learning them. Erm what about things like ox and oxen? I erm Bit of an odd word isn't it? Mm. You don't have you seen an ox? No. No you don't you see them in films about Africa or something or I You don't. I've never heard of one. It's like a big cow. Oh. An ox is just like a cow. Oh. Just a another name for a cow really. Oh. So once you know what it means it helps a little bit and can you think of a word that ends the same as that? Erm no. What would you keep things in? Box. Okay. Can you spell box? Mhm. You can spell box, you can spell ox. Yeah? No problem it's just g it's a bit funny if there's more than one of them if you get two or three you don't say two ox if you had two or three boxes fine but with ox it's one of these silly words you just have to remember it's oxen. I don't I mean you're not going to write about oxen very often are you? No. No so just try and try and learn them . one of those Well like a cow Oh. ox is a cow oxen two cows two Oh. oxes if you like only you say oxen . Mm. Okay? So just learn that to and er keep them happy. Right. You won't use it very often. Some of these words you're much more likely to use aren't you. Yeah sale. Can you spell sale? Is there another way you can spell sale? Like sail on a boat or Right and how do you spell that? Erm Well have a go at the first letter. S. Right okay. And then it's not spelt the same way as this when it's on a boat Mm. is it? Do you know how to spell tail? How do you spell that? T A E L. See there's T A L E Oh. like telling a tale. Mm. And what would a dog's tail how would that be spelt? T A E L T A E L? T A I L. Oh I L. Erm do you know how to spell snail? Mm S N A E L. Right okay it's not actually E L it's I L I L but the same as You're getting in a lot of them you're you're tending to think that a lot of them end in Mm. A E L. Now that ail sound that A sound it's usually either it'll be A L E or it'll be A I L. So you've only got a choice of two there. It's not spelling's a bit messy isn't it. It's Mm. there doesn't seem to be any sense to it really but you can try and make a bit of sense out of some of it not all of it but some of it you can make a bit of sense out of it yes. Whoops . Let's see how many words you can think of that have an ail sound in them. A ail like sail Sail okay so we've got sail that's on a boat and this sale like your mum's going to go to the sales and see if Mhm. they've got any good bargains. Mm. Yeah erm any others? What was the one that we had that the dog would have? Mm tail. Tail. It's a bit ridiculous really having the two ways of spelling Mm. That's a tale for someone who tells tales. Seal. Seal that doesn't make an A sound that's making an Oh no. E sound isn't it Yeah it's an E. so that's a different sound but that's a good one. We had snail earlier how did you spell that? S N A I L I L yes okay. I thought it was . I don't think there are any that are a that are A E L. We've got the E A L ones like seal which you said Mm. squeal plea. Erm so that's snail now what o what else could we have what letters could we start with? Erm fail. Mm. Okay have a guess at that I'm going to put under this column so have guess How to spell it? Yeah. A F A Right F A E or I L . I that's it I L fail. Okay erm do you know a nursery rhyme about Jack and Jill? No. No went up the hill Where Jack and Jill fell off the hill to To fetch a pail of water. How do you spell pail? P A I L. That's it P A I L when it means a bucket. Mm. They went to get a bucket of water or if I said, Ooh you're not looking Too pale. You're looking yeah how would you spell that? I'm going to put it under P this column. A Yeah. L E. That's it brilliant. So you're spotting that pattern. So there is some pattern in this spelling it's awkward it's not as trouble is English is mixed up with bits of all sort of other languages over hundreds of thousands of years. And they've all taken words from different languages and they all spell them different ways. But some of them have got patterns to them and you work them out. Pale erm what else can you think of? How about what's the American word for post they don't say oh we'll put it in the post they say we'll put it in the? Mail. In the mail. And that's M A I L. Are you male or female? male. Male how do you spell that one? Goes in this Oh column. M A L E. That's it M A L E so it's perhaps not a bad idea that we spell it differently cos you can tell which one you're talking about then. Whether you're talking about the mail the Royal Mail the post or whether you're Mm. talking about somebody being a man or a boy or something okay. Any other that have got ail in them? How about Ale? Hello. Hiya, sorry about that, just feeding Oh that's alright the baby. Yeah I'm did you get your books out to show you what what he's been using . Y yes we're just we're just having a look at the the spellings at the moment trying to make some sense of them. Oh right Oh is that your homework for the holidays right. But we're not all the homework we're just trying to find some pattern in the spelling. Okay then. And see how we get on that. I'm sorry I was late getting but I got held up by another lesson. Oh right . Very hectic at the moment it's should've normally been dropping off quite a lot this time but Oh right. everybody wants extra lessons for some reason . Oh right I I was just thinking of sort of trying to you know cos he's in his second year now for the Mhm. next two years trying to sort of get him to bring himself up a bit you know Mm. possibly for going into another school. They automatically go into S F X but apparently there's two different streams there Yeah. and I mean I'd love the Bluecoat but I mean you've got to be pretty clever for that. But you never you never know . Well he'll have to work very he'll have to do a lot of work Mm. erm if you want to get into the Bluecoat. Mm. Erm it's up to you how much whether But there's a few good schools isn't there. you can get interested in it. Mm. Mm there are there are quite a few good schools actually around . Right. Erm Saint Edward's is good or was wasn't it . Well I'm I'm a bit biased cos I went there so Oh did you? But it is t it is erm very good they've got a very long waiting list I was helping helping someone with an entrance exam for there and it's very very stiff competition Is it yeah. Their exam is more or less G C S E for eleven year olds you know Really? they have to be very good just to get in yeah. So oh well we'll have to wait and see. Do you recognize any of those books are they the sort of normal Yes there all sort of fairly standard that they're using Mm. but it's erm not so much what's in the books as sort of how Simon looks at them. And because if you're just looking at every word separately everything lo you've got to learn so many things haven't you if you can pot the patterns and then you can start having a a guess at what it might be and getting it right most of the time and then you gradually learn them as you go along. You can't you can't be expected to learn everything all at once can you? Mm. You've got to people tend to forget that erm things you find easy before you knew how to do them you found them quite hard Yeah of course. and you were probably quite confused and didn't Mm. know what was going on until you got it sorted out. Right. And got yourself a system and started building on it. This is it yeah. until it just seems as if it's an impossible task Yeah. there's just too much to learn. So you've Mm. got to break it down into little steps and do a bit at a time Yeah. and get a a gradual improvement. And another I noticed erm Simon's been bringing a few of his friends home from school and erm I mean he's in a class of thirty eight Right. I mean which is the norm now more or less isn't it but he's I think the third youngest in his class too most of his friends that he brings home are all nine already . Right He's actually not nine till August so he's one of the young ones in the class Mhm. I mean that can have that can sort of Yeah so You know contribute isn't it yeah . Yeah it's more difficult to keep up with others if they if they're older and they've been learning this stuff for a lot longer Yeah. But erm I think he he'll do it alright he'll be able to sort this out. Shall I make you a drink would you like a tea or coffee ? Erm er black coffee please Black coffee. no no milk no sugar. That'd be wonderful. Right. Do you want some er juice Simon? Er n no thank you. No juice do you know how to spell juice? Mm J double O Sounds as if it should be double O it's it's J U I C E Oh. actually. One way you can is that a juice bottle over there? Well yeah but I mean I've like you know ones and two and that into it. Mhm. And I add them to me colle collection of ones and twos. Okay but you can learn quite a bit you could check any of the food or the drinks that you've got in the house you could at those to see how you spell them can't you. So you could look on the juice bottle and juice there you think, Oh that's how you spell it. Do watch out cos sometimes they put silly spellings on which doesn't help. . Okay what else can you think of any more on that erm Erm no well we could do female couldn't we. Yeah. Have a go at that. Female? Oh that's just the same with on . F E and it's just the same. Yeah M that's it just F E on the front male. So that's female quite a quite a good word to be able to spell isn't it. Especially at your age. Mm. Erm how about erm when it's great big little lumps of ice falling down what do you call that ends in ail? Erm erm erm Have you heard of hail stones. Oh yeah erm when it hurts your legs . When it's hail. Right hail how do you spell hail? H A Right. I L. That's it hail. Okay so there's quite quite a few of these that you're getting to know. Mm. Mm. That's hail. That's lovely okay. Now any any others that you can think of? Pail yeah we've done that one . Pail good we've got that. Thanks very much. there you go son Er where do you go if you go to court and they find you guilty?and they lock you up. Oh jail. How do you spell that? Erm J Okay. A I L. That's it. So quite a lot of these you know don't you. Erm what do trains run on? Railway lines. Railway lines okay how do you spell rail? I'll leave you two with them if you need me Right okay. I'm just in the next room. Right. R R A I L. That's it. R A I L. So there's quite a few of these that you know as long as you can forget about this thing of wanting to put A E L. Mm. I mean it sounds like maybe it should be that way but we don't spell it like we have the I A L or A L E. Male and sale and sail. I think that's enough of those. Now how many have we got there? Quite a lot. Do you think you could learn all of those? Probably. Probably no I think definitely. I think let's say you could learn Which ones couldn't you learn then do you think? Mm I think you could learn all of those couldn't you it's just that there's quite a lot of words to learn so they give you some funny ones like ox because it's got a funny plural and there's two or three of them you say oxen you don't say oxes . So apart from that you don't need to know about ox do you. You're not going to be walking down that road and say look there's an ox or No. No. But some of these they're a bit more important. Er now here's another A sound. Playing stayed. Erm how do you spell play? Play? Mm. P L A Y. Okay how about say? S A Y. And stay. S T A Y. Well I think your spelling's pretty good actually isn't it. What's this what have we got here oh a cat okay. Erm and what about what do you do in church? Sit and talk. Do you Poems and That ends in ay? Pray. Pray how do you spell pray? P R A Y. Okay and how about day? Oh D A Y. Right so you know a lot of these so there's another way of making an A sound isn't it there's this A I sail and mail and snail and things like that. And this A L E like female. How would you spell erm another another word for beer that ends in A e has an A sound in it. Very short word. Erm Can you spell ale? Mm. How do you spell that? A I L . I'll put it in this side. A A See it's going in this column I L Going in this column. Mm. with sale S A L E so have a guess. A I L. Try A L E okay Oh. Okay you won't need to know that for a long time yet anyway will you . Okay erm so going back to these we've got day s say stay play pray. Erm any others? What about erm thing that they make pots out of. For modelling ends in ay . Erm Starts with c . C erm clay. Clay do you know how to spell that? K L oh C L Good good C L A Y. Okay great. And how about that cat is that your cat? Yeah. Yeah it's not a stray cat is it. How do you spell stray? S T A Str str. Oh R S T R A Y. That's it stray. Now how about if the cat if your cat had strayed how would you spell that? S T R A D E. That'd be a good way of spelling it that would be a sensible way S T R A D E but they don't spell it that way unfortunately. All they do is they just have stray and then they put ed E D on the end Mm. strayed. Erm do you know how to spell played? It's on there. I know right okay do you know how to spell played? It's got E D on the end of play . That's it. P L A Y and put E D on the end. Erm how about stayed if so if your friend stayed overnight. Put E D on the end of stay. So that's S T A Y E D. Okay stayed. And how about if they prayed? Put E D on the end of pray . Okay so what's that's going to be? P R Right. A Y E D. Right okay. Couldn't really say someone had clayed . How about if someone said something? Oh sayed Sayed it should be sayed really but we don't say sayed . What do we say? Said. Said. Erm S A Right. Y It's S A I Oh. D which is ridiculous really I mean if you pronounce it said it should be something like S E D Mhm shouldn't it. Yeah. Or if you're going to do it the same as we've done these it should be S A Y E D so said is a funny one. One that you'll just have to learn. Right. Okay So but the others easy you worked out the pattern just put E D on the end. Mm. So for most of them strayed prayed stayed played you can just put E D. This one say said you just have to learn that one cos it's a bit awkward. That's a lot of words. Will you have any trouble with any of those learning any of those? Yeah erm. What about these what was the hardest w thing about clay. Oh it sounds as if it's got like a K on it It sounds as if it should have a K usually most words if you're not sure and they start with a c sound put a C . It's normally a C yeah. There aren't many that start with a K. There are some can you think of one. That your mum would use for heating the water up Coffee. to make heating the water up to make a coffee what would she boil that water in? Kettle. A kettle okay. That's a C. That's a and that's one with a K. Kettle Is it? kettle is Is a K. Is it? Oh. Yeah. Erm If they've got a letter E in the s for the s for the next letter then usually they'll have a K. Key key Key yeah that's a good one key. Right. There's a name Keith. Keith and one that was in here Yeah. Erm are you going to keep that? Yes I Am. kept it I kept it. So they've got a K in Mm. keep and kept. Erm but In in school when I'm copying off the board words with like K in the front but like they start with a C but I usually put a K and then the teachers go over them and say like this is a C sort of you know careless and all that. I just keep on forgetting that. Yeah it's not really careless is it it's a question of do you know it or don't I mean Mhm. you're not going to put the wrong one down if you know the right one are you? No. So it's learning the right one. and then finding someway what they've said on there is try to make some sentences that use it so that you can remember what it looks like. Erm perhaps you can think of daft things like think of someone kicking the kettle. Do you know how to spell kick? Kick er K I C K. Right kick. And think of someone kicking the kettle. If you a football easier with that kick. Right. And if you think of that and of the kettle that'll rem that'll remind you that it's a K for kettle same as a K for kick. Erm this is a daft one. What what's that on the carpet there? Cat kicking the cat . And how do you spell that? Erm C A T. Right now if the cat has kittens how do you spell that? C I double T E N S. Very good the only the only there's only one letter wrong in that have a guess which one it was. Double T erm It was the it's a K. Oh. And it's ridiculous C for cat so you'd think it's going to be C for kitten wouldn't you. No it's K for kitten. Now how can you think of remembering that one? Maybe the kittens might sit in the kettle or something. Mm kid. But the cat wouldn't Whichever wa it doesn't matter if it's really daft if you can think of some way yourself to remember it to remember that kitten has got a K and cat has got a starts with a C. Most of them most of them start with a C. If you're not sure if you can't remember try C because it's more likely to be right so you're going to get more marks Oh he's got this right and they won't be putting careless on it they'll say Oh he knows what he's doing here. Mm. Erm so if you just remember try and remember the ones that have got a K. It's no good trying to remember every word that starts with a C cos there are lots of them. Just remember the ones that start with a K. And if it's not one of the ones you've remembered you think well it's probably a C. Mm. Try it with a C it's an easier way of doing it isn't it. Mm. Erm you like football. Yeah. Er how would you spell keeper. Keeper C E How do you spell keep and how do you spell kept? Kept is K E P T that's on there. Good good that's on there and keep? K double E P. K double E P is keep so have a go at keeper. K double E P erm E R. That's it. They write E A R at the end don't they some words. Some of them but not very many. They usually make a sort of ear sound if they've got I mean Yeah. if you have E A R E A R that's ear so how would you spell hear? H as say in I H at the front of ear That's it I hear with my ear. Hear when you hear with your ear it's spelt like that. And when it's what's the what's this over here. That way how do you spell I say is it over here and you say no it's over there. How would you spell there. There T H E R E. Right so here and there You just put a T at the front. Just a T at the front they're almost the same. So that's Mhm. one way of remembering those two. How it's here and there and the other the other sort of hear you hear with your ear and it's got an ear inside it. So if you can think of things like this top remember it helps. If you're just trying to remember them all and you've got all these words and letters floating round in your head it's quite awkward isn't it trying to sort them out which is which cos there are you know millions of words. Mhm. And you'll just think Oh I'll give up. So you've got to get a system where you can something that'll help you so you can make sense of it and and learn. You're not going to learn all the words in the dictionary overnight are you? No. No you can all you can do is just learn a few each day or learn some patterns so that you can get quite a few words in one go and sort of learn some tricks like guessing well we'll we'll try with a C. If it starts with a C sound we'll try a C if it's not one of those that I've remembered starting with a K then it's probably a C. Erm how do you spell coat? K O A Are you sure it's a Oh C. C so go for a C first unless you're sure Yeah if you're not sure you should go for the C then yeah Because most of them start with a C. So how do you spell coat? C O A T. That's it C O A T bit like cat with a with an O in it coat. And can you think of any others that start with K? There aren't many. Kit like a football kit. Kit that's a good one. Kit and kitten so that's maybe one way of remembering kitten. Mm. Right that you know how to spell you know how to spell kit like a football kit or your gym kit. So kitten just put ten on the end of kit. Mm. Okay that was a good one kit. Erm I can't I don't think there are many more. So each time you come across one have you got a notebook to write things in. upstairs. Yeah if keep keep it sort o erm alphabetically okay so you've got the As then the Bs the the Cs depending on which letter the word starts with. And in your Ks whenever you come across a word that starts with a K make sure you put it in your book and have a look at those occasionally so that you're pretty sure you know all these K words and then if it isn't you say well okay got to be a C. Mm. Erm what other words can you think of that start with a c sound? Oh cup. Cup okay and so have a guess at that one. Do you know how to spell it or do you need to guess. C U P. Mhm and what sort of a c is it? Oh. C or a K. K is it? What did we decide? Oh C. Right always have a always g if you're not sure go for the C first so there's cup okay. Erm and what would you wear on your head for going to school sounds a bit like cup? Cap. How would you spell that? Erm C Good. A P. Good was that a guess? didn't know whether to use Yeah so you went for the C and you got it right it's a good one Yeah. to go for go for the C each time cos there aren't many that start with a K. And if you can just when you come across the odd ones that do start with K just learn those and then instead of learning about a hundred thousand or something that start with a C you learn maybe about ten or twenty that start with a K and you say well if it's not one of these I don't know I'm gonna s try it with a C. And nearly all the time you'll get it right. Occasionally you'll come across some new odd ones and the teacher'll say Oh actually this is a K should be a K and you think Right Mm. I'll put that in my little notebook. And so that you keep on top of it so you know that you've got all the ones that start with K. Okay. Erm any other c sounds? Computer. Good. That's a C one. That's a C you know that one okay how do you spell it? Oh erm C O M Com yeah. P P U T E R. Brilliant. That's quite a long one computer. Mm. Okay. Curtains. Curtains that's a hard one let's have a go. Erm Right what are you gonna do you know whether it's a K or a C? No C So what you gonna guess. Guess the C good good guess C I It's C Mm. U R T T O and then it's A I N S which is ridiculous, curtains. Oh oh curtain Curtain. curtains. You don't say curtain. I know. you say curtain but it's spelt curtain which is ridiculous really. Curtain. Do you know how to spell mountain? M O U T Moun. Oh N Yeah. T A I N. Brilliant. Yeah. Yes. So curtains and mountains should really be saying curtains and mountains. mountains. Mountains I'm going to the mountains. Oh take the curtains with you when you go. Okay so sometimes it helps if when you see a word you pronounce it to yourself. Don't pronounce it the way they normally do but just say Oh mountain they went to the mountain . Or write or write it on the table and the table Or write it and scrub it off again with you've finished school . Write it on write it on a bit of paper? Write it in your notebook well keep a piece of paper with you. Write it on the table and then you can That was very good mountain that's a good one to know how to spell curtains the same. Erm More K. Or C more C more likely to be a C. Mm mm. Erm at school they usually have one teacher for each Class. How do you spell that? C Good go on. C A L Cl cl cl Class C L Good. A double S. Good class. How do you think you'd spell classic? I C on the end. That's it. And how do you think you'd spell classical like do you like classical music? Don't worry about it cos these are getting quite awkward words A L on the end. C L A S classic and then A L on the end yes brilliant. Class classic classicism always adding two words Just making it two That's it making it a bit letters. longer each time and making another word out of it . Like Yeah just like . So if you learn the words this way thinking well do I know a word that's a bit like it and could I add a bit onto the end that's another way another good way of learning cos you don't have to learn class and classical and classic you just sort of learn one of them. You can you can work it out. Let's have a look at the ones that they've given you. Which ones are you going to have trouble with. Well there's kept we've go keep and we'll put kept on there as well as Mm. as one of these K words. Put that in me little note pad and all. Yes have we got any other K on there? No. Any words that start Key. with C. Key good so we'll put that right up at the top. the key to learning it all key. How do you think you'd spell keyhole? Put a key in the keyhole. So K E Y key and H H O L E That's it. Okay so another another K word key well you wo could have guessed that if key has got a K then keyhole pretty certainly have a Mm. K won't it. What have we got here. Oh would and could you're going to use those quite a bit in writing Mm. aren't you. Would could and should they're going to come in quite a bit. Cross you might like Yesterday I crossed the road to go Right so cross to the field . Yes cross is a 'd be a good one to learn there. Erm let's see which one of these you think you you're pretty sure about. Erm okay I'll just ask you and you see which ones you do. How about pound? Pound. Yeah. Pound P O U N D. Good. Kept you know that. Mm. Use? Use U S E. Yeah. Sound? S O U N D. Bound. Same only a B in front . Yeah same only a B in the front. So you know quite a few of these. You know kept you know key do you know desk? Desk? Desk. D E Go on. S C. Now this when when it comes at the end of a word Oh yeah. and makes a c sound then it's usually a K. Oh. So if it starts the word and you're not sure go for a C. C and the end But if it's end it's nearly always nearly always a C and a K. How do you spell back? Back? He was a full back. How would you spell back? Mm. Oh quarterback Quarterback. position in a Yeah half back. B A C K or That that's it B A C K and that's the first one to guess really C K that's the most likely one. Erm desk is a bit of a funny one because it's just got the K. If it's got another consonant do you know what a consonant is? No. Ah do you know what a vowel is? A vowel No I've heard it a few times No yeah but A E I O U and sometimes people count Y but A E I O and U. It's hard to make a word without them. You can say pat pit pot put if you put a a vowel in. Mm. Well the other letters that are not vowels all the rest of them are called consonants. Erm and if you've got see if you've got a vowel and then a c sound so if we said Let's have a look at some vowels and then a c sound. So we've done back. Which is B A C K draw a line of vowels and see if I mate a make a word or something. Right that's what we'll do okay. Erm what else could you put in front of ack? There's another vowel A. Ack. To make a word. Act. Erm put something in front of that so this ends it. You had back. Erm If you were going on holiday before you went you'd probably have to. Very good. You'd have to put things in your suitcase Yeah. you'd have to what would you say I'll have to I'll have to something my suitcase? Mm. Lock erm shut. Pack. Pack it yeah . But lock was a good one. Okay pack we'll put lock down then. down here. Lock ends in c Mm. c sound and it's got a vowel it's got this A I O or U right in front of it so we go best guess is C K. It's one nearly always right is that. So lock erm how would you spell sock? smelly er smelly How would you smell sock then? S H O S H O Good. K. Don't forget if it's at the end it's the end of the word the best guess is usually a K oh a C K . C K right . C K Right so what you said I said how do you spell sock S O C K but what you said was S H O C K. What does that spell? shock right. So that's another word you've got there lock sock shock Shock. Oh that gave me a shock Erm The ghost. And how would you sp show would you spell Under the table. How would you spell mock? Mm. It's the witch. for Halloween. How would you spell mock? Mock? Have a guess what's it going to start with ? M M, okay. O O C K. That's it. Yeah. C K is a almost almost certainty for the ending it if it's at the end of the word and it makes a c sound go for C K if it's got a vowel just in front of it. Erm mock okay. Have a go at frock. Erm o F R O C K. Brilliant. It's easy this isn't it. Yeah. Once you've got a sy once you've got a method you can you can get it right nearly every time. if you haven't if you're just trying to remember every word there is in the dictionary you'd be there all your life and you'd still never remember them all. Mm. Because you'd you couldn't hold that much in your head so you have to try and break them down into little patterns of Oh it's one of that lot or it's one of this lot. probably working them out and all. Ah okay well we'll car we'll do a little bit more we'll find out some more of these words ending in K and when we've finished off those erm we'll have a little look at some maths. Okay. Okay. So how would you spell sack? S A C K. That's it. If it's at the end it's almost certainly going to end in C K. Erm how about track? T R A C K. That's it. So just with that trick there are a lot of words now that you'll be getting right yeah. I'm going to school dead brainy and everyone's going Good good. Track erm how how would you spell lick? Lick L I C K. Good did you know that or were you just guessing? In a way I knew it in a way I had to Yeah C K C K is definitely a Mm. favourite that's the one to go for. So if I'm not sure I should always go for C K. If it's at the end. If you're not sure at the end of the word go for C K. And even you'll probably get one or two of them wrong occasionally but most of them'll be right and when you get one or two of them wrong the teacher'll say Oh not C K like desk for example not C K on the end of desk because it's got this letter S in it as well. Erm you've got lock and we could put lack in here Lack? as well. How would you spell that? L A C K. That's it you've got track erm how would you spell luck someone had a lot of good luck? Luck? Luck. L U C K. That's it. Did you know. How would you spell lucky? Lucky L U C K Lucky E Y. Just just Y. Oh. Just put a Y on it lucky. Okay. Mm. And I think you're getting th the idea of this putting C K on the end of a word haven't you. Mm. Mm. Erm How would you spell truck? Truck? T R U C K. That's it. Erm if I get something wrong and the the teacher's going Have the the teachers telling you a way of learning something like I've been saying put C K if it's on the end of the word. Mm. Erm why do you think well why do you think I was telling you that? So I could get more used to them so Yeah do you think I was doing to make it harder for you? No. Right well what was I doing it for ? Making it easier for me. So you could see the pattern yourself and make it easier and a lot of the time at school when the teacher's telling you, Why don't you do it this way? they're not trying to make it harder for you. You might think, Ooh it's hard that way. They know from cos they've had years of experience Mm. teaching people how to learn that most people will find it easier if they We've got learn it that way. we've got the oldest teacher in school. Oh. Fifty erm birthday Is it a he or a she? She. All she's. Mm. Apart from the headmaster. Do you get on all right with the teachers? Sometimes, sometimes I get a bit told off. What do you get what do you get told off for? really stupid things erm Why do you do stupid things? Don't know well sometimes I playing like and this girl, Oh that's stupid doing all this and, you know and she just like Mm okay. Do you play sometimes cos you can't be bothered doing the work cos you can't see any sense in it? No I always sit down and do me work when my gran used to, when I was a little girl when erm, my grandmother used to make cakes and she always used to save it for for me. Mm. You know? There are. But you like a lot of sweet things when you're a kid don't you? Yeah. That's right. Whoops! when it comes up on, next year Got some flour on the table. Yeah. you releas , your allowance is acceptable you see? So you've gotta accept it in a a form Yeah. What's all this paint doing here? You been painting something? No. No, we're going to.

Yeah. And like the th plumbing, you know the another reason fix it on, instead of having a drain for that, a drain for the sink and a drain for this, they all go into one. Yeah. Un under there Mm. Much better. and then out of the side which is which is nice. Mm. Mm. Yeah, it's very nice! So when are you off to Outer Mongolia then? I'm back to Outer Mongolia tomorrow. I got back last night toothbrush Mm. is still, still wet! ! Had a worried look on her face then ! Oh darling! Sorry ! Bonnie's face! Never mind, pet! Erm Where are you going? Birmingham. I'm going to Birmingham? Birmingham. Yeah, on a course. Oh! And then I'll be That's another week. back tomorrow for a week. Mm. And then home for five weeks and back for another two weeks. Oh! What's at Birmingham then? Why do you go to Birmingham? Oh it's erm they've got a, I mean it's a huge hospital!and Mm. they've got a children's hospital there and I'm doing a paediatric health course for a month. Oh right. So children with leukaemia and All yeah? Mm mm. Whatever! Mm. It's all good stuff! Can't be a lot of fun though can it? Erm well i it can be quite nice cos you okay, you we you're speaking to parents and that who've had kids that have gone and died you're not actually dealing with the kids themselves. Oh, so it's like dying and coming back! It's all the theory of it and erm hi-tech stuff. But then what, are there people that are jus that are already qualified in that or ? No, no I'm the first one to go in. So at the moment, if you've got a kid with cancer they can't go to Ipswich or is it just a . No, they do but we share the care with Addenbrooks and and er I mean, the leukaemias do but some of the other kids don't . Look like you was just about to say something then! You're just too big! So you're looking after Gary Lineker's little boy are you? No, no, no, no, no that one that one's He had to have . I dunno, he's got a rare form of cancer but . Mm, so I'm very impressed! Can we go out in the garden do you think?is that alright? It was blocking It's open. the door last time weren't they? It's open. Let's hope you should see my before. Yeah , I didn't see it before. It was a lovely green kitchen! Green? Green! Sort of a Ugh! lime green wasn't it? Oh! Mustard green? No. Well the front here this is green going up the front isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, you get the effects from that don't you? Yeah. It was green and yellow really, actually er It was a sickly green wasn't it? in er , green and yellow. What you gonna do with the garden then? Erm, the idea is we're gonna have that block all we're gonna do is make er this is very ambitious plan here erm we're gonna have the problem with the drive at the moment is if you put one car in it's always the car Mm. in front that you want Mm. out first! I like your car by Yeah. the way. parked do you think! Hey? The erm we're gonna, we're gonna make a drive bit that goes in across where the lawn is now Aha. so that you can have one car there and another one up here. Yeah. So, it'll be block paving all up here and around there and down the side there. So you, are you Aha. gonna have all this taken out? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And do that do that. So you're gonna have, you're gonna have get rid of the lawn at the front then effectively? Yeah. Yeah. And pave right over to the gate there so you, so that you can get either car out one one car and bring up to the back of here and the other two across there . And then, coming through here take it all the way up take this garage down and bring the lawn across. Are you gonna put another garage up or just No. won't bother? No. I find it's dangerous to be driving your car backwards and forwards across the back door innit? You know, the kids? Yeah. Yeah, that's true. So then you know, you've you end up with quite a nice er lawn oh right! You take this up? Yeah, Yeah. Oh and these were the gates were they? That's right,the , they were they were gates at like the front of the house there. Oh it's had all new windows put in some time hasn't it? Mm! Yeah, all the windows except the the kitchen of Yeah. I I expect like yours, they're hard wood and then er aluminium at the Yeah. side. Yeah. No, ours are hard wood solid but Oh! you know, Yeah, yeah. Pretty good! Yeah. Oh you got a little shed! Got a little shed here. We got a greenhouse. And some veggies! And a sort of Are these leeks? things that I don't know what they, yes, I think or or they are. bolted onions! What the hell are they? Probably er strawberries. The bed. What's that there? Are they cabbages or something? Red cabbage. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah? These are . Mm! Looks good! Right. Nothing's growing very well in there. Yeah, once you get that shed and that garage down you can er Be a nice size won't it? be quite Yes. decent, yeah. Mm. Have you been watching that gardening programme? Friday evenings. No, it worries me! Oh! They've had some good ideas though. It's quite good actually. Did you see that one erm with where the, really old boy on a scrap yard, like a, and and then it was like a huge park! No. No. He cleaned it up a bit and a scrap yard and it, and this thing and they were like hills and rock gardens, you know like Oh really! hundreds of yards long Yeah. and and deep! Yeah. This bloke, you know, had been working on it for fifty years nonstop and Oh my god! Yeah, Sue Sue wants it o over a weekend don't you? Just give up! I can't, I just wanna sort of look out the window and it's changed completely! Not asking a lot now is it? Oh it's great! Ah! the old boy . Yeah. Ah yeah. Yeah. And they build up the old . Yeah and you don't even notice it do you? So these cupboards have gotta go on here but the door's gotta go up in the meantime? Yep. Yep. Oh right. ,. We've still we've still got a little bit of fiddling Oh I see to do with the what the well we've got instead of all these individual prints I've got I've got long ones cos if the Yeah. floor is Mm. very uneven. I'm gonna fit them. But until you finish the your messing around you're better to leave the doors off aren't you? What you gonna do on the floor? Well we're looking at we were having a look this morning at erm that vinyl floor covering stuff Mm. Mm. would be best. Do you want to see if there's some wallpaper in here Mark? ! No! It's er that that we're particularly Ah that's er lovely keen on. isn't it? Yeah! Got a real sort of er But it's gonna be difficult to decorate around it, you know, and keep it intact but we'll we'll try it. That's amazing isn't it ? How people Yeah. with chi , er tastes are different? Are you gonna keep this, keep this as well are you? I'm sure it was at one time. Gotta be, but carpet, I mean that was ! Yeah. I think the door's nice though! The thing about this is , it's gonna be a nice room isn't it, when the Well quite! Yeah. you know, the garden is done. Got a decent so you're gonna have this as a dining room are you? Well I I I don't know. Well that might just be you know, like another sitting room It's Yeah. tasteful innit? so Yeah I mean Yeah I Lovely! mean Yeah, don't don't, try not to damage any more of it, I mean No , no I really think of that. Are you gonna be able to get some more from the manufacturer to to patch that bit up are you? Patch that together, yeah! . Yeah! And we'll have another fire in here. What was that, an old Yeah and a gas fire thingy was it? Yeah. Yeah. Mm. If we could get a you know, if we could open that up cos we got one of tho th , have you seen the fire in action? In the lounge? Yeah Yeah. I like it. Yeah , yeah got a glimpse Yeah. of that. I like it. Oh . Oh it is, and we put, light the fires Nice and warm. as well. Yes, it is nice and warm actually but That's actually gas isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Derek was saying about it. Gives off quite a lot of heat. And I think they're quite expensive to run but it was so nice we We got rid of that one. we thought we'd try it out. Well the new one was the new one was we looked at one in the gas showroom when this Alright! thing came out Mm. What's the matter? What's the matter? Mm. You're not tape to taping are you ? No I'm not actually I've rewound it once. Can't work out how Mark, we'd like to but we can't work out how! Well you just shove one aerial output th the aerial input on the other one I think. Mm. Or video, no, video No I like it, this one's nice output to video input. I like this. Yeah. Yeah, it's nice that! You've got It's convenient isn't it? That's right, very Switch it on and you can What's that? The thermostat, I'm just wondering how it works Yeah, we know about the thermostats. cos there's another thermostat on the on the boiler itself. Tell me the difference between a volt meter and an amp meter? Well one measures volts and one measures amps! What's the difference between a volt and an amp? The volt is the amount of current passing through Yeah. yeah? An amp amps is current, and volts is volts ! Well basically with a with a volt meter Volt Right? you put the the volt meter across the voltage you're measuring say, like a battery, right Right. got a battery, put the volt Right. across it Yeah. and you measure volts, okay? Yeah, they're fine That tells you how much,wha what sort of voltage battery you need does it? Well that tells you the voltage of the battery at that particular That you're using? time, yeah? I understand. Right. So But an amp meter amp meter you put in series say, like if you put a light bulb across Right. the battery you put one lead on the battery for the light bulb and then the other The other one lead of the bulb would go through through the meter. Right, to the Does that ma bulb? So it'd go from the, from the battery And Mark's gone past! Are we there? Are we there? Are we there? And If we go from the battery to the bulb , from the bulb to the meter To the amp meter, from the meter to the battery from the meter to the battery , yeah. Right. And what does that do? And that measures current. And that measures the amount of current flow to , when did you pick it up? Oh! Well we had it, got it last night. Did you? Yeah. Why's that then? Is that something you're teaching the kids are you? We are we we've got an amp meter and a volt meter and I thought they were the same thing you see. No. You've gotta be a bit careful cos if you stick an amp meter or a current meter across a battery you're effectively shorting the battery out. Right. Right? Cos you've effectively got a dead short through an ammeter whereas a a volt meter's got a a hun , a high er resistance or an open circuit, effectively. Right. So if I put a volt meter on a battery it would short the battery? That's what you said isn't No. it? Amp meter across the battery. If you put an amp meter across a battery? Yeah. But the current would flow wouldn't it? Yeah, the current would flow Yeah. but you would get a lot of current flowing. Depends what the what the a , I mean if you've got an ammeter set to milliamps and you stuck it across a battery Right. the meter would go smack across the thing! Right. But if you have it set to to amps Amps. then you'd probably get, well whatever the battery's capable of . But the first time he's hitting it See what I mean? it bloody hard ! So you've gotta be a bit careful! Well why on earth would a school have an And amp meter for? all these buttons like the normal I mean, I understand why a volt me , you know, I mean, but I mean, battery's have ? has a voltage written on . anyway! I mean, so what do you want a Yeah. volt meter for? Well when they I'm going to look at being funny. Yeah. Oh I'll be out in a minute. Erm if you the thing is,yo a battery might be marked nine volts Right. but when it's dead, it might only have six on it, six volts. Left? Well if it's dead, it's dead isn't it? Yeah, well it's dead yeah but what happens is, when it dies the volts go down, that's why the the yo your radio or whatever got it's operating and stops working. Know what I mean? So if it, if it's got six volts left, it wouldn't be dead would it? It would just be Yeah, it'd be dead. Would it? Yeah. Right. So what's the point of having a volt meter then? Just to find out what voltage you got left in your battery? Well no, your volt me , I use volt meters all the time at work. You make, build a circuit if you Right wanna test the power supplies you put a volt meter across to measure cos if you think So the power is going round? No, that's Well they an amp meter! You just wanna measure the volt, it's just a test meter isn't it? I mean, you get meters normally, the meters we've got at work and you just turn a knob and it's got ohms, volts, amps frequency you know, whatever. And they get them on one machine? Yeah. I mean, you can use a volt meter as an amp meter if you put a shunt across it. Right. See what I mean. Oh well at least I know that there is a, a different thing. It's all, it's all to do with ohms law, if you know ohms law then you'll understand I don't know ohms law. what's what. No. I mean I think really new, newfangled things! It's really not this . Oh it came yesterday did it? Oh she's sitting in it already. I don't know, he's got the key but he's not gonna get in. Oh. Yeah. I'll have a quick shake, shufty. It's very nice. Well the si , the back door's open innit? Oh is it? Yeah, so you can close it. Station please! Cor this is nice innit? First time Underneath I've been in one of these. underneath there that's your miles per gallon so as you're driving along Yeah. that tells you you know, how how you're driving it and onto Oh right! economy Yeah, yeah, got you! er been quite good in that one. Ha, so when you put your foot down the meter goes smack ! That's right. Yeah. There's your lights. Side lights. And what's, is this beam? No, that's er the rear fog light Oh right! and those are you know The beam would be on a stick wouldn't it? Yeah. It's on one of the sticks. Yeah. Yeah erm Oh it's nice isn't it? Electric windows if we go out later. Oh, sun roof as well. Oh yeah You can er adjust the lights, say that Mark's got in the back Yeah. put that on one Oh right, why? cos there's somebody in the back and that's Oh right, cos of, that changes the angle of the lights. Oh right. It changes the two Yeah, mm mm. erm and then you can control the density of the other lights. And they go down at a bit at a time or it'll go all the way down . Mm! Nifty, what? This is your mhm! Oh my god! like that. Is that for the mirrors? Yeah. Oh god! That's Do you wanna drive? Take it for a little drive. No, probably an ! I mean no, I wouldn't ! I'd take any other cars! No I wouldn't ! In any other car, I'd say it was no. Well you took your dad out didn't you? I know, but bit different. Honestly! The steering lock on? If you were to come back there Oh! all the wa , all the way starting up car We'd better get her out of here, she'll want one tomorrow! No, I wouldn't want . How long have you been waiting for this car, a while haven't you Spen? Erm Got a huge accelerator pedal innit? Just like it covers the whole of January. your foot! January we bought January, February, March, mm, that's not bad actually. So incredibly quiet! A lovely sound isn't it? Erm Mm , too right! How many valves has it got? Got sixteen valves has it? Yeah, no , twenty six. Four cylinders four Oh. . Even even with ashtray Yeah. Ah ! Ah no ! Oh that's sickly isn't it? That is really smart innit? Ah that's brilliant! How does that work then? They probably have a big No idea. whole department working on these ashtrays and then Yeah, I would of thought eighteen German engineers just Yeah. on working the ashtray . That fascinates me! Oh that's brilliant that ! No I like the light because like, as soon as as soon as you put your key in the door Yeah. the light comes on, and then it waits until you start the engine until it goes off Yeah. and then when you get out as soon as, as soon as the car comes to rest the light comes on Yeah. and then it stays on until you've closed the door and locked it, you know Yeah. then it goes out. No, there's all sorts of remote to adjust yo you think you're gonna set the clock so you have a little knob Yeah. don't you? But you don't, you've got a button to erm and you just put that . Oh god! I'm surprised it hasn't got a digital one actually. No. I don't like digital clocks No. I'd rather have it like that. For actually glancing down and looking at a clock It's nice. a Mm. dial one is is actually easier to read isn't it? Well What's sa what's the hi-fi like then? Mark . Not bad really. Just do one more when we've listened to it. The radio's pretty good. And the aerial is in is those two strips on the window. Oh yeah, yeah. Rather than an aerial. Vandal-proof job Yeah. you see. Good for vandals, yeah. There is is like a break, this vandal-proof thing, if you park in a duff area Yeah. You pull them thing out do you. Yeah. You can Oh yeah, take it Take your out. radio out and and lock it in the glove box. And they give you you get four keys and one of them is called the chauffeur's key Yeah. and that will drive the car but it won't unlock the glove box or the boot Yeah, for the chauffeur. so if you do , you don't want your chauffeur to know what you've got in the glove box A chauffeur key ! That's your job then Sue! I like these seatbelts at the back! They come from the other way Yeah, it's amazing! don't they? They go the other way to normal. Yeah. That's good actually. They say that's so that if there's an accident They can just get out innit? then people can er get you out easier. Oh course Yeah. yeah! Never thought of that. A lot of design's gone into that. Good old Gerries ah? Yeah. But it's not Yeah but this one did as well. Yeah. These floor mats see they've got little screw in things. Oh, what's the idea? Just twist the lock and they Mm! It's a bizarre amount of detail but It's got a lovely , lovely gear box hasn't it? Mm. Gear stick on that. Yeah. Nice little chunky one. Yeah, it's very nice! The Germans have certainly got it haven't they? But i , Mark you look at this accelerator pedal it's the whole sort of length of your foot, it's Mm. so comfortable instead of Mm. that piddling bit that goes in the ball of your foot. And you find you see you've got that little thing to put your clutch foot on as well. That, next to you. Is there? Oh No. god! No, go to the left. Oh I see what you mean. And there's a little Yeah, yeah a little they've even put that. They're so Yeah, well it's all for comfort I think. Yeah. They're amazing aren't they? How fast will it go then Spence, I'm sure you wound it up? No, you mustn't take it over They've tested it at a hundred and thirty five miles done, eh? You ge yo you mustn't take it over er, three and a half things or eighty miles an hour Mm. for the first six hundred miles. Mm. But the top Oh course, yeah! speed in the book is a hundred and twenty nine. Oh cos you only got it yesterday didn't you? Yeah. Mm. Mm. I don't think we'll get anywhere near a hundred and twenty nine in that ! It's not that so much though, it's just a luxury and the the quietness of the engine and everything Mm. isn't it? Mm. And Er acceleration I suppose. Yeah, it's very good it's very good like between forty to seventy, you know, for actual Mm. pulling away from lights or whatever it's not, nothing very special. The thing is when you're doing No, but I mean but when you're doing fifty and you wanna overtake something Yeah. Yeah. That's when it's very tight. It's very nice! Let's go and see my sis! Yeah, very impressive isn't it? Got a nice sound to it as well, when you're when you're not speaking. Mm. Little But it only works the horns. with the erm the ignition does it? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah we haven't tried the horn yet. Probably goes diddle di der der da diddle der der ! Ooh! Well you wouldn't argue with that would you ? Splendid, yeah! Oh yes , very nice! Very nice Spencer! Nice interior, grey, I like grey. I'm surprised you couldn't Yeah I actually and the door opens for you. Yeah, that's a bit of a let down isn't it? You've gotta ha work that handle, yes. It is really, you've gotta open the door ! Want someone to lift you out as well do you Sue? Well you know. Nice big chunky doors on it. Yes it's very good! Lovely colour! You choose the colour did you? Well I had Cor! like a blanket with bright red dark red or erm or white. It's sort of a is it a sort of bluey green? Or is it a racing green? It's called nau nautic green. Or I mean the reds and greens are a bit boring aren't they? It's Mm. different. Even though it's just a car . What the hell is that The smell? I dunno, it stinks! Phworr, Jesus! Phworr! You're meant to have a a beige upholstery with it but I think the grey would be Yeah. nice. Oh, better. Yeah, I don't really like the . Yeah very nice! If only we could. I like the cigarette bit! Don't even smoke but she likes the cigarette bit ! Ashtray! Don't smoke do we darling? Well no,. Where's your car? Oh it's just up the road. It's just, I I you know, we were there and we'd sort of gone past so rather than reverse Well no, I I just carried on cos I saw a space there, that's all. Ooh! So how come you got a filthy cold then? Everybody went last week and I got it, didn't I? Alright. Are your mum and dad alright? Yeah, they're alright, yeah, yeah! Said we leave it on the back cos we got roped into , but there we go ! So where did you stay then, there? Is it Not much No. chance of that! No I went in bed and breakfast. They know the accommodation you see and it's really grot! Oh. But it's very good! Sort of make breakfast in about half an hour, quarter of an hour. Right. So the North then? Well I'm not get a taxi from the station you know a dump! It's funny actually cos I thought this is the first Saturday when we vegged out to . Well I didn't actually expect you to be in really No. but we thought well we're going up the grave and it's not exactly out the way so we thought we'd pop in. Alright? Erm some of your clothes I didn't take with me and they're at mum's, I I mean I . To be honest, I didn't know what you were really It's lovely! I mean I didn't take a lot with me, I mean I took too much as it was and my arm carrying it across the Underground . And so the Did you go on the train rather than drive? Yeah. I mean the there's no parking at the B and B Yeah. There's no parking at the hospital, it's terrible! And er you know, it just wasn't worth it. , I should think it's good for him! Put on a bit of weight haven't you? This looks Yeah. wonderful! Mm. I thought you were supposed to go round those, not Have you seen the new Star Trek yet then? No. From I what I see advertised wha Ah that's whe Yeah. when does it come to I , is it in Ipswich then? Ipswich at the moment. Yeah. Oh right. But honestly it's make a date for next week, okay? Yeah. Did you do the Star Trek competition on Radio One? Radio Times. Or Radio One. Yeah. I can I No we did, we did the one in Radio Times didn't we? Which one? Steve Wright No. was doing it was he? No. No it was erm God innit cold again? Simon Bates. Yeah. Yeah. His cardigan's on. Er, yeah I know Have you seen it then? before he was on. Mm. Good? Is it? Best one I think. Very! Yeah. Do you still watch Is it still the old crowd? Do you watch Star Trek now? Shi , William Shatner? Mm. Really? Is it really? Good god, he must Don't like it now though without the likes of William Shatner and that. Is that the new one? Yeah. Well you'll like th th this, it's very, very well done! Extremely Oh! well done! It's sort of it's like erm analogy between what's happened in Russia and all that sort of thing cos they couldn't . Ah! Oh right! It is very good! Have to go and see that then girl! Mm. Yeah, could go next weekend if you want? Or Friday? Well we'll be going to see J F K sometime this week won't we? Mm. I wouldn't mind seeing that either actually. I thought William Shatner had been had to be resumed or something. Right. Yeah, the well honestly the toupees are endless! It must of taken them years to get them made up to look even vaguely Has it got Scotty and that lot in it? Yeah. I mean Scotty's seventy six or older than Bones is seventy one. Yeah. Yeah Bones has really aged ain't he? All these old Er, and Scotty's just you know, he's Is, is erm What about Scott? Scott's in it, yeah. Is Leonard in it then? Yeah, they're all in it. Are they? They're all in it. Good lord! Zulu's got his own ship now. Checkoff's in it, and , they're all in it. Oh Zulu still looks young doesn't he? He's probably about sixty ! Yeah. He's looks far better, I think he is a younger . Checkoff's got a toupee. You can Yeah? see it. You know, it moves without his head sort of thing, it moves away! It really is, I mean you'd die laughing! This has gotta be the last one though hasn't it? They say it is. Yeah. Well there's loads of pensioner's jokes in some of these , it was really, very good you know, when Is he still admiral? No, he's the captain. No, yeah, he's the captain of er see he got, he got demoted didn't he? For Yeah. Cos he went out of Scott's . For going into the Ah he got, ah he got done for that did he? And suspiciously Yeah, he didn't wanna be an admiral anyway did he? No! No, it was very good! All about the Klingon Empire diminishing and what can they do about it? Oh hello mate! Yep! I can't pick him up! I think he's still not made out whose home he's in! Yes, yes, you're alright aren't you? We love you! They're very nice cats are. They move when you stroke them They'd do that all night. and dogs don't do they ? As they indeed! Mm. We've been trying to . Crawl in right by the fire can't you? And he's such a hooligan, you know,he's knackered one of his claws again! Daft thing about it, but I thought rather than hang on I'll get in there and get off. Oh! another anaesthetic to cut it back! He's terrible! Hello! then? Yeah! Oh yeah, could do, if we try it . You can just imagine, pull them out! No! Oh no! Well really when I had the same thing , you know,and goes back for a little bit this morning and er same sort of thing. But, you know, it's just when you think oh my god, that's money! I mean, how much do they cost those pills? Cor! Nineteen and a half pounds, I thought they were more than that actually. God! but you know, I mean I know it's not . Mm, it's very nice though,. The mats had were under six pounds this morning, and I pay only half of that. Oh you had to buy the mats do you? Will the company buy them? No. Oh. Well it was seventy six pounds before VAT. Yeah, but you say that I paid thirty pounds for the Astra, now let's get it in the balance here, you see what I mean, and that sen and then Mm. they've, they're you know, quality-wise they're double the quality. Yeah. Plus they're the German ones and you can say Plus more. I can Mm. that that But you'll don't you with it? What? With the car? Oh yes. But it was that or a Vauxhall . Oh no! Oh god! It's not quite the same thing Go for B M W every time! the sports . Ah, yeah, but the B M W I'm afraid is, they've got it haven't they? Oh yeah I I think so too. I think B M W's are the business really! We were Oh you didn't did he? Well not cos we haven't quite got one, a B M W . No, but a a big four wheel drive thing, you know it's quite sort of. Oh, what that one? , yeah. Yeah But you like them! Oh wha what one is it? He'll be at you, why didn't you get one of them? No,wha what's it called? You know, you wanted to drive one. No. Oh that, what that little jeepy thing? Oh I know, not them! Oh aye, you should have one of those! Yeah we saw that in the Radio Times. Yeah, you liked that didn't you? Yeah. They're not that expensive actually are they? They're cheaper than one of those. Oh yeah! Those, you know, the the really should of got one, you know it's , almost a Range Rover. Mm. Fo four door but there's some problem because it's their . Very . Mm. I just thought it was a bit chunky. the car. Oh I would of gone The BM I would of gone for the four wheel I do , yeah but definitely! I know I wouldn't, I think they've been . Mm. Yeah but trouble is you pray for ra , pray for snow when you've got a four wheel drive car! God Yeah. snow, look! Don't really want it. Yeah. So mum and dad are alright are they? Yes, they're fine! Have they drove the car? Yes. I it's nice you know I haven't been no, I dro , I drove that and it's really quite nice but I might I wish he hadn't of got it cos Sue wants it when he's finished with it. Oh. Do you? Seriously, yeah. It's a nice Well have it! sort of, it's a nice little car to drive actually. It's got the Renault, the Fuego gearbox, you know. Mm,. It's, it is really nippy for a one point four! Mm. Erm, and it's, it's all there, it's, you know it's a nice car, it's the nicest car he's had! Yeah. And it you know, good round the cor , really nice little thing to drive, yeah. Even though It would be nice if it . Oh god yeah! Oh, you know, he's . Really ni , I mean you get in there and you feel really comfortable and everything's there you got a nice radio as well and er but yeah, it's really very nice! Much nicer gearbox. It's a typical sort of Renault floppy gearbox, you know what I mean? No. Sort of play about with it and , instead of all boring Yeah. I don't like floppy gearboxes. Oh! I like a nice a positive ! I like that Fuego gearbox. Mm. The same sort of thing as the like this could go through that. Mm! Yep! Straight on! Yeah I know , I said I want one . Mm. Is he gonna go . He's now done a hundred and seven thousand, I think, a hundred and eight thousand. Just about in the ground now innit really? He won't let you . It sounds like a diesel engine so . Yeah but it's erm Didn't he? I didn't think , it's not that old. I've only noticed it five years, it looks filthy, although it's been in the car wash . Hasn't it? Yeah, it's all the on the roads innit? Yeah. But you want a Sierra . No I don't! You wanted the Sierra! You want the four wheel drive but it's not practical! Oh! So that's gone! Mm. Ho how far have you gotta go over before you you get a you'll get a company car at B T? Er head a group or group leader quite a way. Most of those have got P H D's. It's er it's a bit strange at B T! And then you only get a popular ghia, it's hardly worth it! No you don't! Don't you? Or do you? Actually, don't forget Yeah, you a Sierra, yeah. yeah. no, then you've gotta your car. Who? No No. so th th yeah, but . Mm. But,th he is you know, he is very, very good about it, he would know from loads of money and he's and his company could have a one point six Sierra Mm. you know Yeah. you don't think No. but er I think that they were part of your pay rise one year was it? Yeah,th they had a new, a re-think. grading, instead of giving them a pay rise they get That's right. And I mean er, you know car. if yo if you're earning that sort of salary, I'm afraid to say, which you know, the header groups are Mm. I mean, to drive round in a one point six basic Sierra, well it's pathetic It's pathetic isn't it? really! Mm. Mm. Mm. I mean I just think Well, well Mike didn't have one cos he was too tall! Mm. And he kept banging his head on the ceiling! Yeah, I know, it's tall ! So he didn't have one and ma and my group leader he er he's already got about nine cars cos he collects them anyway ! He said, what do I want another bloody car for! So Yeah. he didn't have one either. They get a good deal really don't they? Well we'll be going to an auction to get like a reasonable car. Yeah. Yeah, I'll enjoy that. We shall get, you know, sort of, an E or and F and They must, they must be going for rock bottom prices at the moment there! I saw an E Sierra in the paper for about three thousand that had only done forty thousand er, an estate. Mm. Wasn't a very good, one point eight. But you can save a lot going to the auction can't you? Bit of gamble a though! Well as long as you don't mind the high mileage cars but if they've been going up and down the motorway all the time Not all of them are the high mileage though are they? . Yeah, a fleet car. But never mind! Well Mike went to a we went to the auction at Yeah. to buy and had very much in the sports car range. No , they don't, they tend Mm. to be your typical company Company car Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But they shift So them so quickly don't they? Mm. You don't get time to think about it. Mm. It's like in But then if you, I mean when we went there was that, I mean, okay it was erm it was a van wasn't it?

How about a Sainsbury's one? Probably it doesn't taste any different. No it bloody does mate. Does it? If you want white chocolate, Milky bar. It's the only Right. stuff that put their life on the line and say to me, yes, you have got rights and you need support and we are here to give you that support. Do you think things are better now than they were five years ago when you started your help line? Well, for me yes, because erm there are now things like the Independent Living Fund, things like that, if people fit into the right boxes and contact the right people, then they can get some sort of help but I mean, it's still an absolute maze out there for anybody who doesn't have that sort of back up. Okay, there's one experience, we'll come back. Who else? Where, who are the other sixty five? What's, what's your experience? Yep? I was involved in setting up a charity called SNIP which is a Special Needs Information Point for parents and carers of children with special needs to get more information out to them about benefits or help in any way. Would er th er, over here it was described as a, er er it's still a maze out there if you don't know where you're going, would you agree? I would agree er, that it's strange er once you start something, I mean people come up and say well we've got a whole information bank here and other people have a whole information bank there and yet the ability of people who are caring, for adults or children, to get out, run round forty agencies and come home loaded with leaflets, pushing three children and a parent, you know is is quite difficult! And we found that er situating This is why phone works. in the sick childrens which we do Mhm. is ideal, it's easy, and it has to be much more available to people. So is the support there? Is it the communication system that isn't quite working but the support is adequate if you can simply find it? Yes? I've been a carer for quite a few years now, until recently, when my grandmother died. Now, she had senile dementia, now the hospital helped a lot in the caring, but I didn't have time, or the energy, ha, frankly Mm. to go running around looking for help. I have looked after my husband for seven years, he had a brain tumour operation nearly eight years ago, and he's in a wheelchair he can't walk, but his, after the first two years of caring for him, he's become bright enough to do the Daily Telegraph crossword, and so he's er erm brain's alright. Well, I did it alone, just with the help of Crossroads, and the district nurse in, in the mornings, five days a week and really that is all the help I had, except that I get domestic staff myself, and any help that I need, I have to pay for. The doctor, my own doctor has been very good and very kind and helpful, but er, I know of no other support group other than Crossroads, who help people like me. And it is a day and night job. And my husband, although I'm only very small and under five foot, my husband is thirteen stone and six foot two inches, so moving him about has been a great problem. Well I'm a carer by choice. A friend came eight years ago for his tea, he's still here! He's multiple in disability, but we get help in Kilmarnock from Salvation Army, who take him during the day, FAB club where I go with him at night, and the hospital,Curtlingside now, who take him for respite social and everything. Now plenty of people are carers by choice, and people want to look after the people who need care in their family, but th i , it's a problem isn't it? I mean, what are,wha what are the pro , inevitable problems that go with being a carer by choice? First of all, you can't work full time, even if you want I do. to. And what? I do work full time, I'm a community worker. But I, I have a need, I had a need, cos, and he fills that need cos I didn't have a parents, and fills my need. He gives back a lot more than we give him. Yes? Down here. I think when you're a carer, caring for a disabled person, in my own case it's child, you're not just erm it's not just a disabled child, you've got a disabled family, because the whole family's disabled because of what holds you back with this one child. I'm a carer through choice, er, I took both my parents to live with me erm, when they no longer could cope on their own and it totally changes your life! Yep. I took my parents when I, my son was two and a half, and I can honestly say that my son, I wasn't able to devote as much time as I would have wanted to give. You've not only you're, you're not only yourself but you've got ki , your child to look, look after, you've also got who you're caring for, you've got their emotional needs as well, and you're emotional needs tend to take a back seat, for want of a better way of putting it. It totally changes. So did anybody else have that experience of of of caring for children and parents, or or parents-in-law at the same time? Yes? Er, I I had to care for my elderly parents when my son was two and a half and I had a six month old baby and er, I would agree with the previous speaker, it certainly does change your life. My memory of those days was being tired all the time, waking up tired, going through the day tired , going to bed tired. I would say the thing that kept me sane during that period was the fact that I had a part time job, and erm we were able to pay for some home help. Now this situation is multiplied thousands of times all over Scotland! Plenty of people are in this situation. Of course, we're all women here tonight,th , there are men carers as well , but would it be fair to say that the bulk of care responsibility falls on women or or is that is that unfair? Yes? Yes, I would think that would be true, because I think the woman is more intelligent and more capable of coping with er you know, the problem. And I think what's getting to me tonight, they're all saying it's a problem, and it's tired, I mean, so is life! Mm. It's part of life! You know, I catered for my father who was disabled and I mean it was nay till I was much older, oh he is disabled! He was my father. He was you know, nothing wrong with him, till somebody said oh it's got a disability! Oh, and you start thinking what is disability? You've still got to get on with life! And I had five sons, a disabled father, according to the media, and er, I got on with it. It is part of life but er wha sa so is death and so is schooling, and so is education, and and all these issues are social, social issues, they are only problems when there aren't the resources to help support people who need support. Now the community care legislation says that carers now have a right to ask for their needs to be assessed, I think that's very important! Many carers, I have heard say, time and time again, that they feel guilty even asking they didn't even know they had a right to ask, well this legislation now allows people to ask, doesn't mean to say their needs are gonna be met, but at least it gives them a right to ask. It says that they have a right to have their own needs assessed, the wishes of the family and other carers erm, have to be taken into account carers have to be involved in drawing up local plans Mhm. for services, information has to be made available so that you know what sort of services are, are available, erm on which to base a judgement about what so , what sort of erm, services you would like. Do you think it's working? The legislation, I mean do you think th th th this sounds like an improvement? Er, do you, do you think it is? Well it sounds like an improvement, but without the financial commitment and the political will then I'm afraid that the erm, the ideaology and the principles will all for nought. At the moment, the evidence is that the sort of money that's being put into developing new services is very tiny, five million pounds towards the specific mental illness grant, which actually isn't new money but top slice from local authority money and then, erm directed Mm. particularly for mental illness and dementia services. Wo wo , it's less than the price of a cup of tea. Can I just say that my father who is eighty four, is caring for my mother er for the past eleven years, and we keep sort of saying well is it not time that she should maybe go into hospital? That's, we as the family. Mm. But dad's attitude is your mother's looked after me all these years, it's my turn! Which I think's lovely! Lilian? Well I work for the organization Crossroads, and I think what I find in in my contacts with carers is that they need help in the way, and when they need it however, our organization is restricted by lack of funding Mhm. because obviously, we can only help them when we have space. Now, Crossroads helps carers, it gives, it gives Yes. respite, or relief to carers, is that right? Crossroads exists to relieve carers on a very short term basis. Yeah. It can be weekly, fortnightly, monthly, or just occasionally on request but quite often we are finding that a person who's assessed as needing help weekly, but all that we have got is fortnightly, and all of the time there are clients waiting for us to up the amount of help that we're giving to them and, very much, it needs to be when it benefits them, and when it fits in with their lives. Mm. The lady, who founded the carers' help line, er, in the literature that you provided for the programme was suggesting that the government should recognise that there are six million unpaid carers. I believe that the government do recognise that there are six million unpaid carers, er I believe that the government depend very heavily upon these six million people, and I do not believe that the government intend to reward them. Mhm. Erm,th , I think it's the government's ideal to promote the role of the extended family which, to me, is anathema in the nineteen nineties. If we look at the look at the role that women play in our society today they have a very heavy burden already placed Mhm. upon them. They're very often, er a worker they're a wife, and they're a mother and all that that contains er, the basics, the shopping, the cleaning, the cooking the decorating, they cut the lawn, they wash the cars, they pay the household accounts. If we go back socially to the days of the extended family, women did not have to play that role in those days, a women, a woman's place was very much in the home, looking after the home and not much else. And, quite frankly, I think that that women these days have very little time in which to indulge themselves in their own hobbies and interests, and I think women should stand up and say to the government, no you will not inflict this responsibility upon us! There. Certainly, I'd I'd very much like to agree with what that lady said. I I work for NUPE, and three Mhm. out of four of our members er, are women, and many of them are both the paid carers, the home helps, the care assistants and so on, but also then go home to look after the young or the er elderly relatives or or disabled, and so on and and as well as seeing, wanting to see far more support in the community Mm. for people who are caring for their, their family we've, we've also said, that employers should recognise that people should be able to get, erm some kind of leave occasionally from their work er, perhaps ten days a year when they find the person they're looking after is is sick. All too often women say to me, basically they've had to fake a sick line themselves because their mother or their father Mm. was ill, but there was no official way they could contact their employer and say, I need the day off because I need to sort something There. out. We've not only got to say to the government, that you're not coping you've got to say, if you're a mother, a worker and a wife, you've got to say to your husband, look, I'm not coping. You can't e expect a body to cope with everything in your life. You say to your husband, help me! And they should relieve you of it. I do , well do husbands help? I mean, I was interested, a couple of the people who who were speaking earlier, Margaret, and in fact,th the two Margarets who both said I look after, neither of you said we look after. Now, I don't know whether that's because i in your house there isn't a husband or a partner, or whether it didn't occur to you to say we, whether you always think of it as I or whether he's out winning bread or you know,wha whatever it is, but Well are are, do men, do men take the loa ,a apart from this fabulous Yes. er father of yours who's, who's, who's looking after er Erm you mother. I couldn't have done it without the help my husband gave Yeah. me. I mean, my husband has even at one point had to come into the bathroom, when I got my mother stuck in the bath er, couldn't get her out, it was, it was him or the fire brigade,tha that was the choice, basically! Erm, I'm not saying he was truly happy about having I think he was quite embarrassed for my mother. But, no, my husband has helped an awful lot, I couldn't have done it without him. Then what's your up there? Yes? I nursed my mother who was blind and bed ridden for four years before her death. Now, my husband was a wonderful support to me, during that time! And I was sort of juggling, I didn't realize how much I was doing until one day shortly after mother's death, a lady stopped me and she said has something happened to your mother? And I said, yes, she died. She said, I thought so, it's the first time I've seen you walking instead of running! Mm mm. Mm! And that, I I was, my hus , during the time mother was ill, my husband took ill, now this is where authorities don't give you any back up, instead of sending him to hospital which was fifteen minutes by bus, I could have visited him every day they sent him to the other side of the county which only allowed a visit once a week, and meant I had to leave at twelve o'clock and get home at six! Mhm. Now no nothing was done! The worse word you can say to authority is, I can cope, because they leave you to cope! Down here. My husband he was very good, but he didn't take any care with my grandmother, but he was extremely good about the house. He looked after Michael, my young son, he did housework, he even makes now, a good pot of soup,he done , better than I do! But, he took over most of the housework, whereas I was looking after my grandmother. I mean, without him in the back I wouldn't have been able to do it, but I always tell everybody I was the carer. Yes? Up there. We're still talking about men helping us, instead of expecting them to do it automatically. Are we? I think we are at the moment, yes. Is that, is that your experience? Yes, I mean I have a very helpful husband, but he's helping, he sees him himself as helping me rather than doing his share of it without having to ask what help I need. Now, that's an interesting distinction! Do you think that's right? Mhm. Aha. Mhm. Yeah. At the same time, men usually have got full time jobs, as well! Well I meant I mean, if they're working full time and they are helping with the children in the house, I mean, they can't do much more! Well I'm working full time too I think they can! so I work as well! Mhm. I think erm, I don't men take a lot of responsibility. I mean, I don't want to er, betray my partner here but erm, I mean he does his share but he doesn't do his full share. Erm I think that erm men don't like to take on women's work because it's erm Ooh! Ooh ! the hours are too long, the hours are too long and the wages are really bad,th really bad So that's , that's er, the women's work is is work that is, the hours are too long, and the wages are really bad? Yes! That's your definition? Well I mean who'd want to take that on, you know! I mean it's unpaid. Well okay it's and invisible. it's badly paid, yeah alright, it's invisible Yeah. for . They don't take it on, take it on full time. Up there. Mm. It actually takes the two of you to pull. I've been listening, Sheena, to them talking about carers, now, since time began women have always been carers. I mean, when you get up and, I believe that it's, a children's duty to look after their parents. I looked after my mother I was the youngest of our family, and I didn't consider that I was doing something unusual, it was my duty. Mhm. And that is why,th with the government talking about, and they're talking about authority why should they be looking for money from anywhere, when after all, the youth of today are the pensioners to , of tomorrow, and it's only our duty to look after them. Mhm. I would have to say that social conditions have changed a great deal today, going back to what the first Mhm. on my left said earlier, and wo wo women have a tendency to say yes to everything that they can do, just because they can do it, and they know they can but they tend to heap up far too many obligations, and that causes many carers Mm. er, to succumb to health problems, exhaustion, er emotional problems and so on. Hazel? My er, circumstances are entirely different, I am the person who's being cared for and my husband died in nineteen eighty seven, and my son in nineteen eighty eight and I was left with my young son, and he looked after me on his own, and then my daughter who li , I was living in Ireland, my daughter lived in England, and she decided it wasn't good enough that it should all be left to him, so we had a long talk and we discussed it at length for two weeks at Christmas, and then they all moved Sou , over here, we got a house in Scotland, and I'm looked after by my young son and my daughter, and since then a year ago my daughter got married, her husband moved in and he looks after me as well , so I'm looked after by three young adults. I wonder how many of you are now, or expect to need care? Button one for yes, and button two for no? It may take a bit of imagination for, for some of the, some of you but what do you think? Do you think you're going to need care? And it's something you might think about as well, sitting at home, do you think you're going to need care in due course, and if so, where's it going to come from? And er, where's the money gonna come from? And who's going to look after your carers? Fifty four of the people here think they're going to need care, forty six are going to stride it out independently to the end. Erm very briefly, the fifty four of you, who's gonna care for you do you think? I've got a young son Yep? he's erm twenty three at the moment, I've got arthritis, sometimes I'm in a wheelchair, sometimes I'm alright, and he says don't worry mum I'm there to push you around and I'm quite heavy! Yes? I I on picking up on one thing that was said Mhm. earlier that, the hardship, I mean i it's okay for some people who have the money and will not feel Mm. the hardship. I know, er a gentlemen, like yourself, who's looked after by his young son, by a younger son anyway, and he he's given up his work to look after his father. Well, in fact, eighty percent of full time carers give up work to But look after whoever it is they're looking after. we we , we were hearing from Jenny about the government, but we we must look into other parties I mean there's a general election going to be coming off soon, we, we as carers should be looking into who is going to benefit us. But it's not just we as carers, or your as carers No! it's anybody who cares sufficiently about It's anybody who needs help. Yes? I'm an ex-carer, and I looked after my aunt for three and a half years, and could I say that it's not all negative although it times you could scream! Really! I mean, at times yo , I can, looking back now I can say that I learnt a lot. Well I sa , I mean I took her on to look after her and I didn't think there would any problem Mm. about it, but after a while ah, I you know, things got more difficult as she deteriorated, but th I did learn a lot. Mm. And now, I I almost felt empty when she died, and I didn't have anybody to care for that really needed me all the time so I I, wanted to help out at a local dementia centre to try and make up for it and to pass on I think that's what I've learnt. I think that's a very good er point Mm. and I, I mean I, I think we've heard earlier a lot o , people who, people who've who have become carers because they need that, they need to care for somebody, and they want that dimension in their life. What's also come out very strongly er, in this programme is is that it's a struggle for a lot of people, both financially, and in terms of juggling time and the multiple demands that particularly women have, in trying to care for young people and old people to the point where women may spend their entire lives between, between twenty and sixty looking after somebody or other. And maybe that is part of real life, maybe that is a fact of life that women have to take on board, but perhaps men have to take it on board a bit more as well . Can we have a couple of final comments, cos we're gonna have to draw to close. We've heard a tonight about carers erm, not knowing about Mm. benefits, not knowing where to find out about benefits, and I think it's right to say that benefits agency staff are there to give information and there is a And that's what you are? Yeah. There is a freeline service which carers, I think a lady said earlier, over the phone is the best way, there is a freeline service and I think it would be a good idea for carers to take advantage of that, if we can help, we will. I, it's unfair ask you this, but do you think it's sufficient the care that's avail , the the help that's available? Erm that is difficult for me to answer but obviously Right! Fine ! I'm going to implement Yeah ! government policy,not to comment on it ! Right. Yes? I'd like to end on a, on a slightly different note. I would like to look at the people who are being cared for, the people that we're talking about, are the elderly, quite often these people have lived through two world wars and given up their young married life, they have brought up their children through the bleak days of the general strike, is it right that these people have to suffer the indignity of charity hand-outs? The eve of their life should be free from worry, and stress, and anxiety, and wondering about who will bury them, and who will pay for it. I I think it's quite wrong er, the way the elderly are treated, that they Yeah. have to rely on charity hand-outs. As ever, we finish with er a lot of things touched on, lots more to talk about. I hope you've heard something that'll make you think, and think positively and perhaps act positively. Goodnight. No No, right Ah they won't do they won't do a thing for the children in their old blind school because R B E A have got so much money we don't put our Yes, aha, yes money into the school Mhm cos there they can do it themselves I agree they shouldn't buy the tickets because they're the They shouldn't ones that have provided us, have a go at They are loaded they're loaded Well there is other things they do want you on special, er pantomime before the school breaks up you know They of course Mhm perhaps we could organize it or something A target one for kids and one for Yes Yeah A standard audience We should get back to R B A, they're the ones who supply the equipment Yeah Mhm they've got one of them and that, none of their children go, maybe, maybe that's a way Absolutely to do it. Well I think that would be worth looking into Yes Right, definitely if Brian could make the sort of Oh contact the Oh yes that's a good idea Yes, yes get a letter out and come back to me What about, to go back to the idea of scheduling and things Mhm Scheduling, yes I mean Yes Doris is seeing to that the difficulty is is we need a mechanism, but the Yes difficulty is we, what we I think need to do is, is establish who is actually arranging dates Mhm Yes I mean, I think we're stuck, we're obviously stuck with a on the sixth Oh yes, yeah and the thirty nine and that Right for the variety of reasons, but I think what's obviously important is if there is any more date arranging going on Yes, yes by whoever Mm that there is that sort, kind of, everybody keeps in touch with everybody else erm I think that's diff you see I, I don't think that's possible for everybody to keep in touch with everybody else, I think you've got to have one person, that everybody looks to, to say, right All the dates are centre that, one person is that one I mean it could work on that basis then, that if, for example, I'm just thinking about, well just from my point of view, when i was arranging that date in Stirling with the Oxford people, I could of said well, Thursday's okay with me is it okay with you until I've checked with Mhm whoever it is upstairs Right kind of thing Mhm and provided it's only one person it's not that difficult It's not that difficult It's not you see because every person Have to check it with everybody Yes, you'll have to buy a chart for that one person Yes, the only thing is that, that in, in each city now Mm well Glasgow and Edinburgh anyway cos that's the other thing now you need perhaps someone in each area to be coordinating again yes all the de you know, because they've got the describers, whoever is in charge of the describers knows when they can spare people, oh no I can't do that week because we've Right already got tied up Yes, that's right so it really has to be the person in each city erm who then gets together with a general coordinator. For this in Edinburgh there is a sort of a forum where er organizations are set themselves round the table and say this is what, the sort of idea that we're gonna do for the next year and a half Right Mhm, yes so that we don't clash with each other statistically Yes So you don't have so we could take it from that stage even Aha yes Yes Yes that's, that's it you see Mhm I've been trying to spot room for that Is this what's erm Try and take it back a step yes Aha As a kind of clash diary Mhm but it's also linked, I mean the other thing that I've got at the back of my mind, is a kind of nightmare, is that when we were talking about the Festival around about March that you know, we spoke to Ingy er you know as a group and then that was all fine and we kept er going along and then, and then there was that sort of dreadful phone call I had from Linda along the lines as I'm not sure if I've got any describers That's right, because it's August Oh yes because it's August Yes you know, part of me was thinking well just a minute you know this service is if blind people can offer describers, but on the other hand people are entitled to go away on holiday Yes Exactly, mm and so you know it is a sort of, I mean it's exactly what Iris is saying it's a meeting with minds in a way because we need to know that, that Yes, because in that case you could of, we could of drawn in people, describers from Perth Yes Connie who knows next year we'll be, we say Glasgow or That's right but, but people should also be aware that the Festival is always in August Yeah quite Exactly, yes Yes, and, and I'm prepared to, I mean And these people all live in Edinburgh Yes exactly That's why they're all tired Rent out their houses That's right I mean I was thinking that you can actually with Linda actually you know because I loiter Linda today's meeting obviously She was on holiday and you know Yeah I thought that was lovely they said she was on holiday, you know, erm and you know, so I mean Mm Mhm maybe this year because it's you know the first kind of year of it Mhm and maybe next year people will take their holidays another time Mm but there are all these kind of variations to build into this problem, I mean I don't know we could, I feel we could almost talk, talk around this for, for hours Mm to sort of see some way around it, but I mean it's a, it's a problem of the scheduling both by the theatres Mhm because you know the other thing to take into this is the Yes sort of thing we've talked about as well with, with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Kings Mhm the Kings theatres in towns where by and large they're showing the same shows Mm Yes and sometimes they go to Glasgow first Mhm and then they go to Edinburgh Yes and sometimes they go from Edinburgh to Glasgow And they usually go to Aberdeen sometimes they go to Aberdeen That's right, yes sometimes they come to Edinburgh and then go away for six months and come back to Glasgow Yeah Yes, yes that's right and I'm quite keen to sort of have that Yes I mean you're never going to control, you're never going to be on top of it but I mean No Oh no it's not, never, doubt it like Alligator Gun for example I know is coming to the, to the Kings up the road here quite soon and then it's going to Glasgow later on, and I keep thinking every time this sort of thing, thing's happening I keep thinking we could be dealing with these Mhm we could actually be doing Mhm you know, erm this, sometimes they go to the Theatre Royal to complicate things, but you know, Mm Playhouse and things but it's different theatres, but Yes you know I just keep thinking the stuff's on the way round and there ought to be some way of doing it, but I, you know, I mean maybe Brian's idea of the, the, the organizations in the ci ci but that doesn't help me you know with a, with a You still need a key person who's going to Yes you do You still need, yes Yes to sit on the information Yes I think so, there's got to be one person I mean I thought about this long and hard and there's just no way, it cannot be done by committee it would not work cos then No it won't you've got people phoning oh, but I told er Linda Yes oh, but I told Iris, oh but I told Jane That's right and you've got all this people not, you know And the information just never comes Never gets together Everybody That's right so it's got to be one person and it's got you're all little bits, innit? to be soon because that's already Mm, be soon Yeah happened but that's gonna happen again Yeah, I think it'll happen again in the spring it's only a matter of time At least we've got dates here for the Lyceum for Yes till April Yes and I've got Brampton till November so we can sort of put those into our September I think what I personally think what you need is a coordinator in Glasgow, a coordinator in Edinburgh to get together with a general coordinator who's going to cover Perth, Stirling Yeah Aberdeen, erm and get together and decide what they want, discussing dates Yeah because the coordinator are the ones who know if they what's have to describe and Yes and the people on the ground, well Linda is obviously the, the other recorder Yeah and you're obviously I'm hoping that Wendy 's going to be Oh at Glasgow, yes If she's going to take over, well obviously if those two come together if she doesn't get a job , I hope she doesn't get a job, that's not very nice thing to say, she's so good, so You know Wendy she's so good at it these she'll coordinate the Glasgow ones and erm Right that'll save me phoning up to say can I have a script please And that for you to take them all That's right Aha Well the other thing that's in the back of my mind is I happen to know that Cath is just taking on a new worker Mhm would she be able to is this a full time worker you've got? Yes she is a full time worker Working beside you She's full time worker and er she's a clerical typists, typist so And so she's more or less chained to a desk then is she? Mhm Nine to five? Or whatever because that's the other problem with people like me is, I'm all over the place all the time. Yes she can certainly I've only got a part time back up you see she could certainly erm offer any, you know, assistance in whatever way the only thing is that erm She doesn't really know the theatres so that's the thing No, no, now she doesn't know any theatres and she doesn't no that's Yeah, you see that's , we really need someone who's involved to be honest Mhm Yeah no, be honest about that, certainly doesn't, she's there, she's certainly there and can offer any assistance you know erm I'm just thinking maybe of a central diary or something, that someone would keep, someone who you know you could relay them with phones say what's happening on the twenty third of January I mean I er, if Wendy is dealing is goi well perhaps going to be dealing with a Yes, aha do you feel that leaves you freer to Well I'm freer to do, I mean I, I got, I wanted to be free because I was getting tied up with that and I was getting tied up with persons, but not agreeing everything Mm and I felt I was being spread in so many directions erm, that erm I wanted to get rid of the Glasgow coordination Aha so You could tell the day Yeah, mhm Shall we try that then? You see Iris has got an answer for you Mhm Yes that's another thing and you can't say this, because I've got to say this for you That's right because you're blind Iris I've got to say because You know, I mean, I'm just thinking out loud, it has to be someone that you can leave messages with Mhm so that's the thing You've got to get hold of them too You've got to be able to Yes, aha erm, I certainly am worried about it, cos I can see, and see when it starts getting out of hand like this, see Yes, yes when it starts going wrong you'll get you'll get going ah, wait a minute Yes exactly Exactly and blind people go wait a minute you know, I want to go to this and I want to go to that Cos the other thing that's worrying me coming up is Christmas Yes Oh that'll be a nightmare Yes because there's that thing you were saying about, the visits Visits, yes and, and our friend in Glasgow West Society not Oh yes organizing tickets and Yes Remember last year remember all that the only, the only date is the sixth we landed up with no idea of the description, on one of the pantomime performances because he wouldn't arrange the date and then Well I mean the thing is, as soon as the Citizens open the box office for pantomime, I phoned them and said Good open and book good now yes and what did he do, he didn't book now Oh no and the first time by I don't wish the time he phoned he could only get Friday of the first week Oh that's hopeless for children now I can't say no Of course not because we have, because it's for the children, so I said we'll do it, but that gives us an awful crush to get it in Friday the first week Exactly, and also it's and he said I have to admit I didn't act on your phone call and I felt like braining him I really did Surprise, surprise Why couldn't you of just said yes well you, well you just two years running you Two years running, yes, last year we did two separate audio Last year we did two, two separate audio descriptions He shouldn't mess it up Well I think this is another case actually where I think in, in that Yes it is situation that, you know, hopefully by next Christmas we'll we'll maybe be a bit Maybe, maybe we'll get a coordinator who will just say I'll book the seats for you It's not far away Yes quite, exactly and You owe us Yes We'll, we'll move it into a position where, you know, maybe we can bring the Sid, Sid on this well as well and say Just send the bill to Glasgow then that's right maybe, maybe it's something that which may emerge as well with you Yes if you talk successfully to the R B A Yes oh yes watch, watch yourself over Christmas it's very complex, yes because I mean the whole point innit is to have the audio description and also it should be, it should into the runs, so that Yes so that it is People will have time nearer, nearer to Christmas because Christmas Eve would actually be the perfect time to do for children Yes, exactly I mean children just get more and more excited Yeah and, and er, Alan, Alan actually said to me last year why I don't see the importance of audio description anyway Eh oh well I mean that was red rag to the bull I don't think he ever, ever has, has he? Well I've got people on my committee who are on R B A board Oh and they, that's why we got the equipment of course and they all support it and Jim supports it Jim's so there shouldn't be any problem No through that The chairman Mhm There shouldn't be any problem, but I mean he won't won't Right instruct the school to do anything about it No but we might be able to convince him. So what we've agreed then is that,f f you're hoping that Wendy Wendy is that E or I? she actually Yes she actually volunteered, ha Oh she's sweet Would take over the coordinator and Linda Linda through here Mhm Yeah and obviously And my offer of help still stands for Wendy Right, because the typing that Iris will still keep the diary as it was Yes, lovely Iris would actually and maybe what we should do is buy a diary Yep and I could have it a year diary in fact Yeah because that's the sort of seasons you guys tell me what Mhm erm and you know and that would be their kind of bible get one with a lock on Yeah and er, you know we, we would just have to Yes set up that mechanism that you know Aha, yes everybody and, you know Everybody checks them everybody checks with those three people Yes I think so I mean in a way the purse thing is a bit more distant A slight more distant, yes but non the less if you're Mhm I mean you're still gonna have a But Stirling isn't for instance, they'll want to consider their pantomime again Mhm Yeah, yeah, so you know we need to sort of pull that together It's very important for the equipment as well if we're using the Yes, it's the as well Exactly, yes, yes exactly all by and large I mean it's almost certainly it's getting it from one place to the next Oh for instance, for instance Same equipment for the same blind people Well come the twenty come the twenty fourth of September Give it to the blind and they can take the equipment equipment in Oc in Stirling then from Glasgow back See induction see which is a nuisance now, well it's a nuisance but thank goodness at least it's there It's there Yes but not they won't like you going back but it's, you know, it is a you won't like going back, no I don't like it either Mm if we had our, our second system in each city then There we go that's right Yes, mhm you can imagine, I mean come in and use it as a centre and the phone and never thinking there that yes that's bad That'll help and also for any the other coordinator unless they've got a problem because er Well can I say then that Iris will keep a diary Right which is also the equipment diary, that, with back up from your Yeah Yes, yes, it's a lot of work So, right I'm just wary of the time Mm it's twenty past three Mm Right erm, moving on, erm audio description in Scotland, no er since this, the last meeting, yes Cath and I have been talking about all that money, we had an entertaining day out Entertaining day out and to cut a long story short, we went to see three possible funders, er funder one was T S B Foundation, where to cut a long story short I'm pretty sure that T S B er we, we have to put an application in for October I think we'll, we'll buy us another system Only because the guy had lost his sight in Korea Mm Oh good good So you should always send me Yes definitely definitely Of course too late Oh yes I think you're right if I hadn't of been blinded he was out the door So, er meeting number two was with Geoff from Carniki Trust and he er welcome, welcomed Robert's, Robert's got a us very warmly and erm Oh yes Mhm and he's encouraged us to put an application in to do more, more so with the training side of things Mhm you and I will need to sort ourselves on that, that's new Er we just need to get the money and Yeah erm, yeah I know it's, it's writing the application a little bit so that, that will be quite good, erm and lastly we went to meet with Sandra from Youth Out, fund employed theatrical fund, which was a meeting we weren't really allowed to have, and this is certainly not for the record Mhm erm because I'd phoned up and asked for them, er my secretary had phoned up and asked for a meeting with her but the response was we're not allowed to meet with you, so we said okay, cos it's public money and things It'll give us the edge, public money and then we arrived,we arrived at This is good where the Carniki Trust is in Dunfermline having just managed to get there on the petrol in the tank erm we happened to go up the stair and er, the door was answered The door was shut by this woman, who said, you know, who are you? What you want? So we said were Robert and she sort of gave me an odd look Aha went away and came back and said oh Mr will see you in a minute and it turned out it was Sandra because Youth and Carniki I knew are in the same building, which is why we wanted to see you and she said while, since you are here, I can meet with you We won't talk to you I bump into a lot of people at conferences, so I haven't been able to write formally to thank you for the meeting because I don't want anything on the record then She made us tea as well Oh good, I read in today's newspaper Oh erm on the train coming through that Esso have withdrawn the sponsorship from sports in Scotland Oh really? Oh Oh really? and they're going to concentrate on community Ooh Ooh ooh I thought we're a community Everybody likes that one Esso immediately Nice one Esso, mm get in touch with Esso, oh yes Small flurry of ayes That the one with the tiger or is it Shell? That's it Tiger Esso's the tiger Esso's the tiger Esso's the tiger Esso's the tiger, yeah Put a tiger in your audio description Yes Mhm so and UFAF, UFAF is, is a, in fact UFAF I felt quite pleased about in a way because we'd, we'd analyzed Maggie and I had analyzed the documents and Jane and I and Graham and I had spoken about it as well, that they are principally interested in unemployed volunteers Mhm but not impulsively, but the, what I did have a concern about and I think we'll have to be a bit careful about this as we go forward is that, the audio description project is about audio description, youth and funding is about volunteers Yes, she's quite clear in whilst the two er obviously Aha fit together It's the way you it's not quite the same No so it's not exactly like you're trying to put you know you're trying to put a right hand onto a left hand, but it, it's a certain element of that, erm having said that what do you think? I mean do you think she's going to respond well? Oh definitely, aha Donna made out about that Yeah she said, she's very into Alan and she knows his work Mhm cos he's I phoned Alan, erm their rehab unit Mhm is back to back, with Carniki in Dunfermline Yes, that's right so you see she sees him coming and going, she sees the blind people coming and going, so hence the kind of yeah, so is that's it Oh I knew that so I didn't know that so that was alright, there you are, you see so that's information on giving out. Share this information, so no, I think she'll help and I think he'll help erm because of you, because obviously very committed to that Yeah Aha That should be quite good, but it's not enough of course No, I mean that, you know, that, that all kind of gets off the ground Aha er, what, the next thing that I've agreed with, with Mary Mm is that once obviously there is a specialist application to UFAF, to, to their forms Mm there'd be a not quite a specialist application to Carniki, Carniki will be linked to UFAF Mhm due to the timing we have to apply to Carn , well the deadline for Carn Carn the deadline for UFAF comes first Yeah but will be considered second Mhm Mhm Not till December it's not considered That's right , the Carniki is the deadline is end of September and they'll considered it in October Aha I see but it will become Carniki decision will be conditional on UFAF application, I think Ah, which is a bit iffy Mhm but should be okay but since Geoffrey is actually one of the UFAF trustees as well it will all quickly fit in together It's all intermingled, yes Oh yes But once we've agreed is, once, once I've done the work, we have done the work, I have done the work with you helping me, er I've written this application, what I want to do is turn that into a much more general one and then I can write to you know maybe twenty, twenty five trusts on a more general basis Yes saying you know, we need a sum of money and Mary will help me with the marketing of that and hopefully after that we would, go on enough to keep us going, so hopefully by the time Christmas comes Mhm I mean we'll, we'll obviously have to sort of keep a, keep an eye on all this all the way through Mhm Can I say, I, I can express concern about that because I think that in terms of funding I've written A short term and B long term erm I think we've got a short term problem and Yeah I speak on behalf of Playback not as Playback itself, but as Playback being part of the Regional Council that can a bit, now I was at a meeting this morning where I, I sort of absolutely had to read the riot act about Playback because they do not have a set budget whether you know this or not, they don't have a standard budget as they should have, we've fought for this for years, what we do is, we survive through crisis to crisis, now some money has been extracted from the Playback budget and whilst I have to share two bits of Playback, you know, the, the actual Playback charitable, voluntary bit, and the Regional Council, I mean they, I, I can say that they do not have a backing of money that they can fall back on, too many backs there, but I mean really I would say that I would be concerned if it was Christmas before we were ready, I, I can't help but think if we could and I mean, very, very happy to work with, with anybody and everybody on this to try and get these things pulled up quite quickly, I mean if it's forms to be filled in then Mhm you know application and that, surely we could maybe tackle that quickly and then Sure, well we would be in a position to have this letter because I'm getting anxious, I've written a logo first and then this long term, short term and they're connected Yeah, right I think we need to move a bit faster Well when I say Christmas I mean that's actually decision, I mean we can't hurry the meeting that you've had and we can't hurry the meetings one we get Yes decisions, no, no, no for the actual post of all that stuff I appreciate that, but the actual raising of money and something Yeah, well, no I'm thinking that these, these applications have to be in both of them by the end of September and I don't Yes see why the, the second string of the trust letters shouldn't be going out straight away after Aha Straight away, yes But again you're always linked, you're always linked to Aha, yes cos again I'd go for assistance on that, you know deadlines, a lot of these trusts only meet once a quarter I know and you might get lucky Mhm Yeah Yes and get in Mhm but you might you know miss it by a week and got three months, two months, three weeks at the most I just er, it would just be, I, I just, just would be concerned but your you know Yeah, yeah that, that Playback's left, you know, for, for a very long time because I think you'll agree and I know it was a decision taken by Playback and that you Hang on Cath, Cath Playback had been now been paid back Playback have been paid back Have they completely? Yes we have, yes, the same as the Edinburgh Society, yeah Oh well, then, I, that really takes away my short term concern then Aha That's fine because that wasn't running the Edinburgh Society had given us some money, that's not me My clock's going bananas you know Mine doesn't make that noise now No, that's my clock going bananas Nothing over here Mhm Yeah well that's fine then, sorry I take away my I should of maybe actually asked the question Has Jane had enough first because erm Leave it there, right That's why you meant You mentioned logo there and erm I think that's where Now again, can we go back to that because but I think this, this comes down to the RNIB, I mean if we want a logo it should be an audio description logo for the country Yeah For the, for everybody don't you think so? Yeah it should be national A national one Except Well except then if you're writing off for money to places like Telecom and it's a national logo Can you not have a national logo which is kind of personal wise Oh I mean, I know that in America and all the different cities have their own logos Okay so maybe we could do that here on the logo front when Linda wrote to me and said she couldn't come to this meeting Yeah she said I have enclosed a, a draft of a logo and she didn't, I have seen it because Jane's got one Who is this? Linda Linda Linda had a contact who'd done something Linda had done one because remember but Alex did one way back which would not of course and at college Yes say was wonderful, but I think we should maybe try and just gather them together and but the sooner , the sooner we get a logo the sooner soon I can get placards made to put above our heads So lovely, get it out there but if we have Linda's just, just that Mm, with information on Yes exactly Can you find it? Mm, I've got it somewhere Could you, could you maybe gather Linda's and Alex's and anybody else's that they've got Well those are the only two, I mean Linda's, Linda's one is the more I'll give you one Oh, but, ah, well Iris's That's three then Yes Three I've got all the bits and pieces of all Okay, well put it on the agenda next time Right, yes, please I think that's a wee I can't find Linda's Aha and if people could get a copy of them all before the next meeting Do you have friendly relationships with a graphic designer, at this ? Yes, yes we could hopefully try and make a decision Yes, yes I mean I couldn't care less, as long as it was something must get something Linda's is the mask in the theatre Oh yes Not really, but with headsets and erm lights That's it, that's it and headlights coming, you know, the Brian has something to come up with Oh do, do which is yes Ooh Yes yes please Yes please because I just think it would, it's so important to get that bit, that bit goes along with the all the application bit, if we tie those two up together Yes I don't think we'll have a problem with money you see Mm but it's got to be done properly and One of, one of the things is the, is the, I don't know what the eye is the good thing to have in the, if somehow or other Be incorporated it To be quite honest I quite like the iron Yes and I know that's a bit blind and, and I'm usually Well saying the opposite, but you do have to remind people what you're doing it's, it identifies you really quickly Mm yeah, mhm It does Mhm Perhaps, right well great if you can get something good, good If you're not so very artistic, all but seems Just need to come up with a brief It was more or less something along those lines wasn't it Yeah I could, I could Something as simple as Linda's Linda's? It did have, yes I, I mean it, it wasn't that, but it was something you know that It was the masks theatre masks Should, what they were trying to do was copy the masks that you have in the Yes Mm Lyceum And oh so it's a Lyceum over there really. No, no, Personalize, personalize Lyceum has just got a new logo I noticed Oh don't no said can we have your of the men working in the in the in the carpenter's shop. He was he'd been hurt that was the usu that's why some of the men did. He'd been er had an accident in the quarry some time ago and he was working in the helping as a mate or something in the carpenter's shop and he he must have been h must have had his hands in our pile of finished products and er Well partly finished products and er he er he was caught one of the cos er these castings there was a an edge to them you know,the joint of the the mould that came together sort of thing. They had to be filed clean. This beggar had come in to the fitting shop,corner at the back corner, where he shouldn't have been. I mean he wasn't supposed to be in the fitting shop anyways. So the the manager our greatest enemy, we used to know when he started from the house in the morning actually by quarry that er he was coming, but the on this particular day anyway, somebody had slipped up somewhere. And he saw this bloke you see, where he shouldn't have been. Er filing away. And he had this this erm casting of a plane you know he was cleaning up the edges gave the game away of course then . Oh dear. Anyway we I think we supplied dozens of youngs kids that had no toys during the war. you know. . Erm yes well th that's the only erm casting you know, that we did. bearings for for you know, shafts mills really the old type crushers in mills that They were really old fashioned crushers. And they had to be the bearings had to be either you had to have a s a set ready at all times sort of thing you know so a spare set. Erm yeah oh the bearings we we they usually were bought from They were American er brass bearings, huge brass things you know. They used to cost about two hundred pounds in those days and that was a heck of a sum in those days you know that sort of thing, how much they cost and had to be careful of them and all that. And erm the other crusher, the Buchanan crusher up in in here, the the the primary crusher, the American one. Well that that used to be sent away the o the main bearing the main er jaw bearing that was on the . It was usually about six Was it? Er somewhere about Aye getting on for five five foot long. Erm th that was sent away to London white metal that that that was quite a costly affair as well. That's the one that you see in this er book you know.. Is that the one which was having the ? Yes cuts in it. Yes yes. Yes. And erm the old chief that designed er er erm a boring bath for it for boring that. They they didn't they they just cast them roughly. Well not roughly I mean they I mean they didn't sort of finish them off w wherever they was s sent to in whatever the firm I I I don't know the name of the firm, I was I wasn't involved in didn't bother as long as the job was done. And erm the He made a boring bath so that the whole block it it was a massive thing you know, that that that had to be . I should imagine weighed somewhere about five six hundredweight. the capping. Cos of the design of this crusher affair, the whole weight was carried on the c what could be the bap of the bearing you know, the bearing cap. the whole lot down you see. Oh I see. On the on the You There was only the was only er three quarter of an inch out of centre sort of thing you know, but the shaft weighed ten tonne and you have this huge and it just l revolved of course and and the whole lot revolved under this cap. So the whole weight of the whole er the gear that actually sent the crusher going and made it so the jaws the swing jaw swing and all that, was er hanging on the cap you see. It didn't matter, the other half didn't matter because it didn't come into contact really with the with the shaft. And erm the Oh he'd made I'm getting er losing my track. But er he'd made er a boring bath from the chassis of a steam engine. There was a spare one lying around We'd finished u er stopped using them during the war some time during the war. Cos coal was hard to get and all that. And er gone on to diesel. And this old chassis had been built up so that this bearing lay on that and it was turned by and electric motor and all that and the boring bar went tool went and bored this bearing out and travelled along on its own its own It was fed off course. you know it was a quite a a brilliant idea really . Cos he was a brilliant man actually my my boss er my chief at the time. He was the erm he came from Anglesey. And he'd been apprenticed in Liverpool with a firm called they were ship repairers in Liverpool. And er I suppose he he'd gone there when he was about thirteen fourteen and er he came from a family from Where was it . And some of his rel relatives they farmed but some of his relatives were blacksmiths as well you see. So he'd sort of had a well I suppose he'd messed around helped and played about in the smithy. Before he even started erm when he before he went to Liverpool as an apprentice. But he was a brilliant man he was years ahead of his time really. Erm Ingersoll Rand w wanted him in America. He was offered a job in America with Ingersoll Rand but he wouldn't go. And erm he was by the way he was the er step erm father in law of the man who erm owned who was the erm building firm er in er er Oh dear they've gone now. It's just been taken over by you know, it's gone into the big big time er Oh dear me, I forget his name now. name of the man. G Anyway Oh er and er er he had a son who was a a dentist in . John quite a well known dent he was a very good dentist. I suppose he he erm William, William Owen old chief. He used to bring his tools up during the war to er to er so be seen to you know. Cos they they were hard to get . . Oh yes . And er one of the men that was helping the old man to to do something, to repair the the these tools you know, and he he'd gone to the stores to get something and leaning over the counter to get something er er to sort of talk as one goes on a on a counter lean he was leaning a on the counter, and he erm the the the storeman he was a tough little beggar, and he said, I've got a I've got a I've got a toothache. he says. And asked him you know, Erm which one is it? And the other silly beggar opened his mouth and pointed to a tooth you know. And he just dived in there and and got hold of it these tools er once you get a hold of those things you know they they're pretty They're fantastic you they won't. I mean them they're designed to er so that they don't slip or anything. And he held on the handle and he pulled the ruddy tooth out. But he pulled thing was sorry thing was that he pulled the one next to the one that he had a toothache in . Wow . was tough, he's still alive in . Er couldn't have done him any harm. And er No but erm that's how the the old chief . Erm as I say he was a he was brilliant man er I mean we all we I'm about one of the last of the ones that were taught under him. I mean we were very fortunate in having been app er apprenticed under him you see. Were you were you aware, before you went there, that erm you were going into You were going to serve under someone who was rather talented? Well I'd heard of him yes. But I was er here I was one of the first People have forgotten that there was such a thing as a fitting shop in you know, in . And I started a fashion really in going, cos no-one had er thought of the thing for many many many years. And erm later on let's see f when the war started and I mean they wanted cheap labour and all that, there was room for apprentice. Several boys went to the fi to the fitting shop you see but the I'd started I claimed to have started I mean it's I mean there's no credit to me but at least I was the first You know I'd really started the thing you know. Where had they come from before then? Oh usually. Yes. Yes. Yes. They knew more about it yes. was the Well I suppose they had first claim in . that sort of thing yeah. But they came with the chief being an Anglesey man you see, they came from Anglesey as well to erm they used to come a lot in and erm as apprentices you know And er Aye no, the ol same old game again that er we in Wales seem to inherit it's in I suppose it's in the B B C and everywhere isn't it. It's not what you know, it's who you know. And er somebody's got a relative somewhere . I mean happened even even with the monarchy and all that most Welsh people ran ran England when they didn't have it really did they . These families that left Wales to help out with the Tudor and all that. Erm I still er think I think they're still running Britain aren't they. gone way out I've gone gone through to get to to Llandudno. Erm th this tea making was a a er job of course there was a a break at nine o'clock you see. Cos we started at at half past seven. I used to catch a bus ten to seven, down when the in those days. Never been late in my life. Erm the erm Course the the blasting was on at nine. They used to blast, first blasting at nine o'clock, throughout the quarry you see so everybody had to go in so that was an excuse for a break. About ten minutes break. Then cos you had er three warnings you got five minutes before and er then you had a the erm final warning and then the blasting and the they give you the all clear. I mean it took about ten minutes, quarter of an hour altogether. So if these beggars up at the top it was had been er thought out had a break well er it was alri =right for the others working down in the bottom to have a a break. So nine o'clock break. make the tea, go round the Used to take about three helpings of tea to make the the the bottle . I remember we I had this sort of enamel brown enamel jug, ooh it was mm must have been somewhere about four. Mm couple of pints at least eh. Oh more three pints I'm sure. Er and erm I used to put it in this and go to out into the mess room outside where they there was a cook and it was a very grand name for a person you know, a cook. It's almost as grand as a chef these days isn't it. The bloke who sits behind the ship in the chip shop. Banging that basket he had they have,Erm and er the er used to go there er and there was a boil or was it er er an old fashioned I don't know. Have you se have you seen them the old fashioned boilers they used to have? Er sort of Yes, half spherical, Yes. cast iron. Built er with bricks built round it and er a tap we used to have a tap on it you see. And the cook in that mess room and the cook was always a youngster who started in the quarry. That's the way you started, up a ladder to the to be a managing director . A cook. You know like like the this thing about every soldier having a a a field marshall's baton in his knapsack . anyway erm they started at Well you know quite an easy job but the the er s their wage was about sev I I I I forget. I d I wouldn't know. I think my my starting salary at fifteen was seven and six. Out of that I had to find, threepence a day erm bus fare. Excuse me. And we worked six w six I mean we worked Saturday mornings you know, six o'clock. Plus er going up going to you know, all that. Sos there wasn't much left of the seven and six to kee feed me and all that . And er I think after and when I became sixteen that er had to start paying your your m paying the union I had to join the union as a junior member you know. And er hospital fund and all this business. Anyway erm so you . our standard of living Well our standard of living was alright. I mean er didn't bring much home. And er the cook I think the boys e had about er started on ten shillings you know, ten shillings a week. Erm but er that was this boy's job and then he used to er you know, scrub the tables in the rest room and of course boil the water first thing in the morning. And er wash the cups and And he used to have to go running er down with messages down to or down to the head office rather that we had an office in where where our fitting shop was where there was a draughtsman's office. And a store, a store a sort of store clerk. Cos we had other people concerned with the stores down in the head office as well, the buyers and . And a couple of young clerks, that's where they bred their clerks for the future use sort of thing you know. I see. And this cook had to go down and carry messages back and forth and all that was his job as cook. Not he he couldn't handle a a roast duck or er couldn't roast a duck or anything like that you know. Or make orange sauce or er anything of that sort . Er and I don't think any other most of them started and they're still here some of them. Er still roast a duck any more than I can. Well er not without a a book of instructions anyhow beside me anyway. Er anyway the that was the cook's job and that was my job, I used to sort of go across and fetch this tea and have it ready by the time the men gave up work at nine o'clock. But er I used to go I didn't eat with the men you weren't allowed to eat with the men you see, it was only the full men that sat round this table well That was Half about eight of them you see. Well it was the same no distinction at all in that sense, but er you know we were sort of they had more serious things to talk about than I wan er you know I knew the cook, er couple of o other apprentices from the carpenters shop we used to go into the main th there was no-one to keep an eye on us in the in the mess-room you see, no-one to tell us. So we could play. And erm at the same time there was an old mill there as well, with an old er engine room. Which had apparently been a a steam There had been a steam engine turning this er mill crushing mill and er er I remember there was a name in in this engine it was Queen of the Valley. And erm we used to go and play in that sort of you know do the things that boys usually do. Sort of Oh we used to risk our necks walking across the ruddy this mill was a bit of a wreck actually and we used to go playing in places where we shouldn't have really. Anyway, that's beside the point. But erm and then at during er before lunch and all that I used to have to go take a bucket and go to the smithy and erm as you may know, there's a a cooling er tank beside in the in er beside every every every erm blacksmith's fire and er you know to bo keep the er no t no to keep the nozzle of the Of the blower? blower going you see. Oh. How do you do? How do you do? Hi. And this co er and used to get w hot water from this tank you see, lift it out with a ooh with some sort with a ladle actually. Er and er put it in the bucket and get the right temperature. Up my elbow and er anyway put it used to take it back to the shop and er well I was still inside the shop, down to a certain place in the shop and put it on a on a stand and then there'd be a on that stand, beside the bucket, was a a box of not Lux not Lux soap but er yellow soap. Oh yes. in Welsh. And erm slabs of it it had been cut like er it looked you know if you sort of cut lard or something like that. No you don't belong to that age either do you. Erm you know you get it in packets now anyway. But er you know used to sli cut it out of er big chunks. But er there's be lump of this y yellow er stuff you know. And beside that again, another box full of erm well partly full depended on what time of the week it was. Erm dust quarry dust and er very very fine chippings you know. So you got a handful of this yellow soap. And er rubbed it and it was quite very hard you know. And er put a dollop er dipped your hand into this the grit as well started rubbing using the water we'd got. Some hot water. And see my hands they they they're quite they're they're exactly like a er well shall we say an educated person's hand A person who's spent his life working behind a desk. But you know it's funny how why it was so I mean the grit and those were quite sharp you know You you'd have thought that it would have taken your skin but then it was ideal stuff for getting the grease the you know the dirt and I mean the the greasy dirt away. It's easy enough to dirt . That was the method that we used and I didn't I never heard I didn't hear of dermatitis or anything until well twenty five years afterwards. Erm I mean the one could very easily have have got er some form of dermatitis with all the you know various oils and stuff that we had to put our hands in. But erm and all the old mill for milling that we used to used I mean kept our hands clean anyway. So that was one job a and then we had a big used to beg for a an old sack from the stores and open that out and er I used to wash them wash it and get it very soft and clean and hang that up and that's the way used to clean and keep ourselves cl hands clean . And er but for all this, erm funny enough we we had er a fair in twice a year. we haven't had one for oh many what fifteen, twenty years a co er there used to be a couple of women used to come to sell rock. Up to about twen they kept the thing going their pitch going I suppose twen to about twenty years ago. But we had a a spring fair in April and the other in October. I think so. And the fair was on the first of October. somewhere round that time. I I'd er you know the older men would tell you. Cos I I didn't sort of go by fairs and things like that, I belonged to a different generation. Erm but erm come the time had come for for the fair let's say the the the Spring fair. I'd get quite a surprise because very s small number of men in the shop. I get about shillings eight and six, nine bob pocket money. Fair money they used to call it you see. Mhm. Er I know er perhaps I was er civil or obedient or whatever, I don't know but er I I they u they used to have this this collection for the for supposedly for carrying the water, I don't know. But erm er it was a a nice sum to be to take with you to the fair . You know. Er because it was more than a weeks wages . To spend evening. And used to happen twice a year and erm sometimes somebody'd remember my birthday or find that I had my birthday or and at Christmas time we used to get some money. And this was out of a you know er I mean they were only what Oh couldn't be more than about six eight people working in the Well not actually fitters but er you know, they were involved within the shop sort of thing. I don't know how many t other people were approached in this collection, I don't know. But erm they were you know they were exceedingly kind really. Yeah they were very kind too. Cos their salary we we well their wages weren't much. They I believe that er a craftsman's wage was somewhere they'd a take home pay at the end of the fortnight. You'll notice that I say end of the fortnight, that was the settling time . Er was three guineas. Was it? It was one and three an hour. the craftsman and fitter's rate in those days. And a labourer's rate was eleven pence an hour. Mm. Wh what erm what ye what year would this be that you sort of s I don't k nineteen thirty seven maybe? Thirty seven? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. And erm you know it was a a bad time really b you know it was the thirties I mean people say it's bad now but er I don't think it's it's as bad now as it was then. I know the unemployment figures may be higher and all this business, but erm I mean er a single person during those days, er say a young man in his teens, working would been s stopped in the quarry. They were bad times, they used to stop. Er they were very fair er if I may bring in er this has nothing to do with my er well no it has as well. You know friends of mine, I knew them. Erm they were quite fair the the in this quarry then. Cos if it was slack or anything they they used to stop the bachelors first you know. I see. Er you know I I I af I mean after I didn't think anything of it, and in those days I was too young of course to think of th things like that. But thinking back I mean they they were it was very good of them really you know,the they were very fair. Er in the way that they and they sort of well I suppose it was the situation in which the quarries you know sort of or and . And er the foreman and bosses that knew people and they knew the circumstances and I suppose they put a word in and erm you know men were sort of stopped because er I mean, if a man had a house full of children or something, he'd probably be the very last you know before he was sort of forced to g you know sacked or wh And I mean they weren't sacked in a sense, they was always ready there was a place ready for them to come back to there. But erm So laid off I suppose would be a more appropriate way of s of putting it. So that it was it was generally thought of as being a fair system ? Yes. In the main I I should think yes. You know you know erm a young man I mean it was er er reasonable wasn't it for a a single man to be laid off before a married man with family family responsibilities. And er generally er with families being larger er in those days, erm there'd be perhaps another couple of sons working or or something like to help. make a family income you know or or increase the family income. Or So they could all eat at least. And erm no well as I say, erm I think they were pretty fair. I mean f I d I doubt whether firms would do it these days eh? It wouldn't be considered fair today anyway. No the union would step in probably and er say that er last in er first out or some ruddy Mm. nonsense like that eh? But that's the memory I have of it eh? Wh when you went in as an apprentice, did you have any i i idea of what the job was. What it entailed? Oh yes, erm you know, having been brought up w in a you could almost say a quarrying atmosphere that's the right er expression but erm I mean one knew what w went on in the quarry you know. Erm mind you it was really a step onto something else that as far as I was concerned in those days I meant o go to sea of course and er that was the best place you could have er to serve an apprenticeship because everything er I mean it was one of the As everything was starting to get specialized in in other works nowadays it's gone completely now. But erm we had a sort of a spectrum you know it covered such a wide well area if you like of er of engineering that one wouldn't have had a chance to to have a any contact with in in any other works, you'd be doing as one certain sphere you know a certain type of work, and there you are you that's your lot eh? But we covered everything you know, steam engines and diesel engines and oh crushers and construction work and development and pneumatic gear, compressors and oh any damn thing that went going. We made everything ourselves more or less. And had a hand in oh designing really there. We were always taught This er comes back again. I think er you know this our our boss, er who Mr as he was called he was given his full title of er Mr William Owen , then. I mean er much more should have been something should have been Aye he's well worth er within the engineering world at least, well worth looking into his life really. Because he he he's done a a you know he he he's been a a a a what shall I say, a Well he's done a lot really to to to to to promote erm interest in engineering and all that and and he's done a lot in helping er to young men to become engineers and that you know. He he he's erm really er the results of his his interest in teaching. Er North Wales you know have have benefited. Firms in North Wales here along the coast which came after the war of course. Can you sort of amplify that if you can? Well As I told you to begin with, he he he he must he was a man was er years ahead of his tim really. I mean and he he although he er he wasn't a graduate or anything like that I mean he he was a brilliant engineer. His ideas are as I they they say that he was er I don't know how much truth I that he was the first that he patented and devised the first rotating drilling machine. Rock drilling machine you see. Cos the f the the the they did have pneumatic drilling machines quarries. For ooh from beginning of the century I suppose. But they were only hammers in a sense. They only hammered the they the the they didn't rotate. I see. They just r r rammed their way and you had an man the they had a man they tell me I I've never seen one But erm this was as far as I can make out er by the They had a man standing by you see with a a spanner and er gave it a quarter turn every time it hammered the the drill sort of hit the rock, went into the and hammered. They had to give it a quarter turn you see with a spanner. But erm that old the A and B we used to call them actually. A and B. Erm there was no dis disrespect but A and B and er he'd erm he devised a method he what he did he rifled the inside of the the piston. He rifled the inside of the the the the cylinder and the piston was rifled as well, you know slightly ribbed, so as it went forward it turned you see. Came back and there was a er it couldn't turn cos there was erm Oh dear I'm forgetting my engineering terms but er you know it's a that's the . And that's this is er I think I've already told you that he was offered a job with Ingersoll Rand which were the main er people that dealt with air and air products in the old days. The American firm. They tried to get him to America you see. But he wouldn't go there. William didn't want to take his overalls off. Because he he liked to work with his hands. Yes he was a heck of a man. He could he was a brilliant machinist and er oh crikey I've seen him turn out a a three throw er crankshaft within a couple of days er you know without any precise measuring and and and in fact he just sort of put his roll on on on a on the shaft he was turning and just sort of gave him an idea as to I mean his eye was almost as good as many a bloke's measur measurement with a rule. But er a three throw crankshaft for a bump you know couple of days to erm he was a heck of a man. And he dis We had I haven't told you er didn't tell you or h I er don't think I've told you have I, that we did have a a chemist in the quarry you know. Full time chemist. Would he be analyzing samples? Yeah analyzing yes. Mr his name was. And he apparently was a very very nice man too er I mean he was I mean er er er er a nice disposition I mean yeah. they stand out . And er oh he he was he erm during the war now come nineteen thirty nine and that stale period when er there was nothing doing really in France, between the time that er our expedition to the to the Maginot line and all that. Er he went over s there was a plane laid on for him and he was ve went over very often to advise them on fortifications on all their concrete fortifications in France. Did he? Yes yeah. Very well thought off actually. And he designed some er I remember them being built. Erm air raid shelters. Built to his design under the rock face up at the top here in . And er concrete and all stuff. And er rock er dropped use that expression, they used they were both right at the at the foot of the quarry face or precipice or whatever somewhere around a hundred foot high and then th they blasted the top see and dropped a whole fall. A fall is what we call you know a bundle of Rock. rock there. Ah excuse me. And erm on this er structure and obviously there wasn't a everything was fine inside it. Mind you, no-one volunteered to stay inside when it was . But erm all the intact Now, a slight apology to make. This, things aren't going very well for me today. Er, I missed the train, the video thing wouldn't work when I showed my film lunchtime and er, the book that had to read, er, unfortunately, is not in the library, so er, the le let me explain the background to this. In previous years I haven't had a class on the and I thought I had one this year as an experiment and er, pardon me just a second hello yes, that was a little annoying to say the least, cos those students have come in specially for that, yeah,yeah yeah yeah yeah right Oh dear right certainly not well, would it be easier to show them in my office, that's seven, seven, seven? Well, I could fit most of them in, I'm currently getting in about twelve, ten or twelve, I could fit them in. Alright, let's do that. Could we, could we have it from next Tuesday in my room? That's seven, seven, seven. Yeah, and you could perhaps let me, let me have erm, let me have one of those little ones. Perhaps I could keep it, could I? Right, okay yes, sure, sure, sure. Well, shall we have it in my room for next week? Thanks a lot. Bye . This audio visual, ah I apologize for that. Sorry, this will be printing for a while. It's just my new book. I'm sorry. You'll just have to put up with the printer chugging away. As I was saying, yes, er erm, I put it down, erm are you gonna tell us the history of the book, or? Yeah. There is a bit of Right, okay. Well, let's wait and hear wh what says, he'll probably explain to you the history of why it is like this. But as I said, I do apologize. There was a copy in the library at one stage, although not listed under it was under , but I now see that when the other day I looked erm, according to er, there isn't even anything under . Did you look under too? Yeah Right, right so I'm very sorry. I won't do it again next year. We won't have a class on that's just somebody that republishes the book. But erm, anyway er, tell us what you made of it and we'll take it from there, I think. Well, the book was er published in the early nineteen, well, it was written in the early nineteen thirties but er, it wasn't actually published until nineteen sixty seven. Erm, for instance idealistic man primarily, Wilson, President of the United States. So basically, subject given account of er Wilson's life and his personality. In context the psychoanalysis in order to explain erm Wilson's actions and er, attitudes in the pres presidency of the United States during the First World War, basically con concentrates on erm . Despite highlighting er Wilson's intellectual and physical achievements, for instance, he er wrote a very er, well respected book called Con Congressional Government in his earlier cabinet career, and also he initiated domestic reforms , the book is er generally quite scornful, reporting character. Especially the neurosis he suffered from erm, throughout his life on which the his presidential and political career. The main argument put forward by er, er, was that er was that Wilson suffered as an adult, because of the over oppressed rage he, oppressed rage he possessed, which was directed towards his father. As a child, Wilson was er, regularly subjected to the darkness father and criticized and lectured the young Wilson. However, instead of er releasing and dealing with his rage, Wilson er instead chose to strongly identify with his father, erm argued er Wilson never grew beyond his father identification, because the situation whereby er Wilson was full of, of the conviction that his er mission in life was somehow divided. In identifying with what he regarded as his father, Wilson thought that he would er emerge from the war as a saviour to the world, so to speak. two went further in an effort to oppress his rage against his father, and to avoid a highly threatening career situation. Wilson identified with his father, to the extent of wanting to have genital, genital contact with him, since Wilson saw his father as the author of all his skills, his strength and all that he'd been grateful for . This was based on apparently wrote to obtain er, or basically to obtain. This is arguably supported by the close contact of the relationship Wilson had with his father, and Wilson's deeply held religious conviction, which he espoused in his presidency. However, this subconsciously held conflict with his father in subsequent over identification with er led Wilson to be somewhat stubborn,perhaps even complicational as a, as you know, as presidency of the United States, which were, were often directed towards or often only minor details of his work, but he wouldn't he wouldn't actually range them towards say, any major . Er, accompanying this accompanying this frequently not himself, which it occurred throughout his life, through his childhood as well, and his general er sustained willpower which was highlighted by frequent illnesses, especially in his er president of the university, where Wilson suffered defeats and conflicts and transfer of reform of rebuilding the university, and also we see there er back part of his life a Wilson of his own er, seem to direct some of his rage against er, a coloured colleague of his, a . Graham argued that all this is indicative of a person who hasn't grown, fully grown out of his childhood worries, problems, especially the er, he hasn't actually dealt with the true feelings that he had towards his father, and who instead chose to vent his rage on others and political career, which resulted in Wilson being, er well, losing some of his rationality, which led to his poor performance in er negotiating and gaining acceptance of the Treaty of after World War One. Erm, apparently that's what the trouble with the ratifying in Congress that led him erm,some degree to another centre in Massachusetts. Erm, and this also explains in part, why he er complains made by-rules and all concerned what was into Europe, did not materialize. Er, I think if you're gonna try and erm, explain you know, try and assess the validity of the book. Agree or ask yourselves why you agree. Tell us about various reasons, not just study of value of the great of the greatest value there. It seems Freud and perhaps even wanted to er, vent their anger on Wilson, because of his failures concerning the war and its aftermath. Immediately after the war, when Bullett first approached Freud er, with the idea of writing the book, Freud was apparently feeling very depressed, and er, he was savagely critical of his own work, and er, because he had little access to patients during the war, he generally felt quite down and also by presenting written for him, all he would need to wr all he would need to write, and according to er,other people, perhaps he was eating, he was receiving just sort of waiting to die. Whether that's er,I'm not too sure. Erm, anyway, this was when Bullett actually first approached Freud ninetee nineteen hundred and twenty. The disappointment with Wilson felt like Freud must have sort of lingered for quite a long time, cos it was not for eight years that he actually ventured on . This was highlighting the fact, that although, er, Freud thought psychoanalytic should be used in a neutral nerve and not used for any active aggression, an exception seemed to be made with Woodrow Wilson. Although some may be quick to say that the vast majority of the book was actually written by Bullett, and not by Freud, no less than the actual intellectual framework of the book apparently seems to have been due to Freud's input, er, Freud certainly was psychoanalytically trained, in any, in any sense of the word. Er, perhaps the whole project could also be attributed, mainly I think, to Freud's desire to try and keep open the er, the er, analytic publishing house, which he founded in and which er, basically was kept together financially from the er, forwarded, forwarded er, royalties which Bullett sent from America. er, the book has been very heavily attacked by contemporary writers even mentioned passing for the . Complaints have been made, for instance, by erm, er,. The er, book is based on an inaccurate and sometimes even fabricated evidence, due probably to the er, rather idealistic er, excitable ambitious er Bullett, rather than the peaceful like of Freud. Nevertheless, evidence er, was dealt with by our assorted version parent. Much due to the influence of Freud, cos of course, Bullett wasn't a . Contemporary studies of Wilson by, for example, or perhaps even are apparently based much more on fragmented material than Bullett and Freud, Freud would allow. I can't really clarify that . Erm, for example, it appears that Freud and Bullett er, misinterpreted Wilson, especially as regards to the nature of his father. For example, argues that Wilson did not have any sort of homosexual likeness for his father. But that Wilson longed for a psychic union with fantasy, fantasy father. So that er, Woodrow could experience a full sense of self, to actually relate back to his himself, which er, Wilson er, experienced only as a child. His childhood. Er, you have a sexualization of such a long period, Wilson, er, didn't seem to have, sort of, being recorded to his sexual fantasies of that nature. Although there is er a general agreement that Wo situations were, were re really more complicated,in the Wilson family, er,Wil erm, Wilson actually certainly loved his father, his er his mother an and his er father. Er,Wi Wilson, er, did not seem to allow his father's wit and criticism to get him as much as Freud had er, suggested. Er, certainly evidence seems to suggest that a very genuine and close relationship developed with his father. For ex for instance, they er, often confided in one another , usually when they to see what they actually er share each other 's deepest thoughts, and this continued throughout later life, it could be argued bu but it continued throughout later life and what they, they often communicated by er, by letter. It could be argued from this, that er, Wilson's father began to identify more of his son rather than the other way round. Especially as Wilson's academic career flourished, and he er, and he wrote to his father less and less. So of er, resulted in a rather er, sad feeling in his father, the thought that actually his son was starting you started to by his son. argues that er, Wilson suffered from strokes throughout his life,not even emotionally recorded due his psychological condition. The reason why this occurred er erm, the reason why this occurred was not due to some sort of er, due to emotional problems that he suffered within these repressed relations with his son. Erm, and also the reason why Wilson could not actually read until the age of eleven was not due to the emotional er, problems of his father, it was due to a sort of a form of dyslexic er,th there's a hell of a lot of debate about this, er, all these things just what er, Einstein is er, criticizing. But er,sad sadly there's er, evidence that sh show that if there is a dyslexic. Erm, however, it maintains that er, Freud could not have er, known about this, although it seems to invalidate if they are correct . Erm, if the move on the was psychoanalytic issue, er despite the book being generally regarded as an embarrassment to psychoanalytic, is somewhat non . It er, has initiated others to demonstrate how the use of a psychoanalytic science for the actions of upstanding, public, historical figures. Biographical studies can be found on a variety of historical people, including various artists or politicians. But this simply underlines a point that psychoanalysis is, by the very nature biographical, thus historical point, er, historical methods to trace one's actions and reports in the presents, present er, relation to those who they've experienced in the past. If your psychoanalysis is reports, and not just the actions, of it can be a, used as arguments to er, allow this story to emphasise what the human ages evolved at specific suicide of men, erm, goes on to show examples of his erm, he actually claimed to have used this as a sort of process of identification of even fantasizing, in order to try and er demonstrate how er, I think it was Hadrian's Wall was built, try to identify with engineers and architects who built Hadrian's Wall, in order to try and work out what the actual function of the wall was. It wasn't, it wasn't regarded, it was regarded by a positivistic er,as just being er a big wall to stop barbarians er, attacking . People have said he er, they seem to think, that he was more, he was more the sort of territorially divide sheriff sort of er, league of division between er, the two lands, and he was also a sort of lookout post. Erm, this er, again, try to be right be er try to understand the mind,instead of just, just looking at the harsh facts, the hard cold facts and trying from there. So, in effect, there's a subjective animal which can be very useful when trying to explain a glimpse, for example, employed for example the total I E prime and er, also in the psychological . These books also extend beyond a biographical compass of the history, by examining the development of insecurities in society, like as in the future of civilian. And also the relationship between the leaders and the masses in history, er, between the different groups er and then comparing the relations between these masses and different groups and different parts of history. Er, and it can be also er, also er, course in civilizations in history and trace in theory selection in society. Er, psychoanalysis is important, because it acts as a realis as a realistic er, dimension to historical analysis. There is a tendency to try and lo er, continually adjust the plain hard facts, without recognizing that they are, they are in fact socially constructed. That's the objective. It must be supplemented with the subject. For allowing ourselves to look at the report and find the actions, and not just the actions themselves. Erm, so in this, so in times of the Woodrow Wilson or perhaps Freud er, took the subject too, too far. Allow his own feelings and thoughts just to run away with him, which later er, in rather er, a nasty very er, made some very disparaging remarks of the family. But despite the er, rather individualistic nature of the context used there's enough flexibility and openness within the subject content, to say . The psychoanalysis can be used to a limited extent, despite more collective, historical roles er, within disagreed over conflicts in people, or perhaps you say that all the time. Erm, going back to the subjective erm, psychoanalysis introduces erm, no, that's the subject erm, psychoanalysis introduces. Also historians themselves, historians themselves can't actually completely stand outside the events they are actually studying. I mean,th th they're just moving away from the issue, because it it's using a psychoanalytic stories. Try to give a psychoanaly psychoanalytic study issue. Erm, can you keep with me? The er, the very important experiences of this story were never to be received into his work. Or our work. And would be useless the er, content and electrons. I suppose er, suppose that, suppose that er, main department store other contents from other dimensions. Psychological content, but again, in that content, in that er, particular content, psychoanalytical context can be useful. Well done,w well done , excellent, I mean. Although as I said, it was perhaps a mistake, erm, both classes produced excellent papers, that th it was a first class paper, in the other class and so was yours. didn't read the book. Where did you get all that material from then? Erm, books on psycho history publish yours. Right,. Oh, you went through all the psycho history books? Yeah, well done. Erm, well it's a great achievement. I think that given that you were er, you couldn't find the basic book that you were expected to read, I thought you, you gave an excellent account of it, I mean, if you hadn't told us that you hadn't got the book, I don't think we would have guessed, would we? You would've got away with that one. But erm, no, absolutely first rate. Well done. I think you can, you can really erm, you can really be proud of yourself on that. And erm well, what do other people think, I mean what, I suppose no one else began to look at it either. I will be giving a lecture on it, so I'll have my say about it. Erm, has anybody looked at any of the other books, like for example, the one on ? Did you? I didn't have time. Has anybody got the time? I'll tell you the reason why I did this. Erm, in a way this was a bit provocative. What I what I thought was, well let's have erm, Woodrow Wilson, okay, as you said at the beginning of the book, Freud admits that he didn't like Wilson, and that he felt betrayed by Wilson, like a lot of people in Central Europe did I suppose, because you know, Wilson came over erm, with fourteen points as the saviour of the world, and went away leaving with a piece of . And Freud and a lot of other German speaking people, thought that he had let them down, because he didn't have the political goodness. Erm, and so Freud at the beginning says that he er, he, he had a personal dislike of er Wilson, and resented him for what he had done and held him responsible for the subsequent disasters. So, so Freud makes no bones about it. Erm, the book by Leo who's er Labour, was a Labour M P, no longer er keen collection reports. Erm, on , I put in because it was the worst example I could find of the abuse of psychoanalysis for destroying somebody's personality, personality assassination by, by er a psychoanalysis. You could imagine what it's like. I mean, erm, if you didn't know it was meant to be serious, you might think it was a great send off of psychoanalysis, you know. Kind of make you hoot with laughter half the time, erm, and the contrast with that is the point, which I don't know whether any of you has looked at, of course, called Gandhi's Truth. Well, as you might tell from the title, Gandhi's Truth is the exact opposite to book, because it idealizes Gandhi, it makes a, a kind of psychoanalytic behaviourography, you know as if Gandhi was some er, great great kind of saint. Despite the fact that Gandhi one would have thought provided rich material for psychoanalysts, like going to bed with his erm, nieces and his lady doctor erm, and naked and claiming that this was a specific exercise, erm. Nice work if you can get it. Erm, and so on, so, so, so this was the, this was the, er this is what I was trying to do, try and contrast the use of psychoanalysis in, in biography, from character assassination on one hand, to hagiography at the other, and with Freud's Woodrow Wilson somewhere in, in between , but perhaps nearer the character assassination end, because erm, neither of them, er neither of the authors were, really had, had much of a brief of Woodrow Wilson. And, and really it was just as experiment, and erm, the reason I put it in was, I thought, well, you know, this is, this is an ignored book, and as you, as you found to your cost, it's actually hard to come by, harder to come by than I expected. It's out of print. Yeah, it's out of print, and erm, but I though it raised interesting issues, anyway. I mean did other people think that? And what kind of issues did you think it does raise? It's not worth psychoanalysis Right, now as mentioned, there's a whole literature on this course,ps psycho-history, isn't there? They've even got their own journal. Have you, have you read any of this stuff,? Erm, this is, this is what this school of thought tries to do. In the past I used to have a, a class on psycho- history, and I dropped it, and one of the reasons why I dropped it was, the lit a lot of the literary was very poor quality, for a start, and erm, people, er, students, er got that too, and I couldn't really blame them. And, er, the other problem with it is, you really have to know quite a lot about history, or biography to really to really get into. I think you found that with Wilson There was one chapter in the book, I read it in the . All the pages in biography . Five or six pages instant analysis and it hardly No. Absolutely, so Two novels If yo I hope you, I suppose you could have a whole course in psycho-history, if you really put into it enough, but for just one class, I thought it was too much to ask students to attend, to try and have to get into psycho-history, so I haven't erm, done very much of it, and this, my excuse here really was, well Freud did write a book called Woodrow Wilson. It is touching on the social sciences in the sense that Woodrow Wilson was an important political figure, and there is an historical dimension. So that was my excuse, for, for, for bringing it in. But as says, I mean it raises er, a fundamental issue, which is, is psychoanalysis or, psycho, are psycho insights applicable to for example history or biology, and this is the issue, isn't it? What do people think that? Is it just, is it, is it, is it just trivializing, to think, to talk about, for example, Woodrow Wilson's childhood? I mean, does anybody think that's a trivial approach to history? I mean Do you think so? Yeah. Do everybody agree with that? you tell it Yes, of course, erm the point has to be made, that Bullett, unlike contemporary erm, biographers of er Wilson, those people you mentioned, actually knew Wilson, and an you know, being his administration on that man as it were , and apparently Bullett had a lot a first-hand erm, biographical data, didn't he, according to the book? Also tended towards to make a judgment of him, Mm. I think Right. Right, and the background to that of course is, for those of you who may not know, Bullett was I suppose a more junior person in the State Department, when he went to Europe with Woodrow Wilson in nineteen eighteen, and nineteen whenever it was for a peace conference, and Bullett was the only one of the American delegation who resigned and confronted Wilson and said, look, you've gone back on the fourteen points, you're not doing what you said you would do. How can you go on with this, and Bullett was the only one of them who resigned and went home. And er, later of course, he became the American Ambassador of Vienna, so Freud met him, but so, so, Bullett had a personal stake in this, but I must admit, er my own view was, was rather to admire Bullett for his stand, because it's a rare politician who stands up and says look, you know, we've been there, having made promises, we've broken all of them, and we ought to resign, or you ought to resign. He told Wilson. And, and he said, you know, if you aren't going to resign, I certainly am. And he did. So erm, it's quite true that Bullett had a personal axe to grind, I think it was a rather justified axe. But erm, it er, that fact remains, he did nail Wilson. He was at the conference, and a lot of the book, if you read the book, is concerned with what actually happened at the conference, and basically, the basic problem with the, the book tries to look at, and this is where we, we get back to question of the childhood days. Why couldn't Wilson stand up to the allies, why couldn't had stand up to Clements or Lloyd George, in particular? They seem to have bullied him and made him er, make concessions, and the question that Freud and Bullett constantly ask is, why did Wilson make these concessions, especially since his position was already defined before he came to Europe, you know he already laid down the fourteen points, and sold it to the American people. And then he came to Europe and, and really, let it all go. And their answer of course is, look, here was erm, there's no political or historical reason, because Wilson had all the cards in his hand. The, admittedly the French Moy high prices and clearly that is aimed at A and B. Looking at this one you can see that the whole format's totally different, like the cartoon on the front and the layout. And that who would you say that was aimed at? Well it's young people, what sort of occupations? Would it appeal to you? Do you think? Er there Mm yeah I think it would Yeah. So we're probably thinking perhaps partly students. Er because people in this age group haven't yet become managers and certainly not professional, we're probably thinking more in terms of the Es and students and perhaps C twos C ones. These are not cheap holidays so it probably rules out the D category. So the social class structure is important. It's also the question of mixing between these groups as well. It's claimed that people feel uncomfortable if they're plunged into a group of people who are perhaps from a different social class or background say. In particular in this country and it's also the same in France and Germany. We tend to be fairly what we might call gregarious, meaning we like to stay with people of our own type. People speaking our own language, people who do similar things to ourselves. The final one here again, simply economic. Again we're back to price and things of that nature. And then we have the individual psychological factors which go through our heads. And the things that actually go through our heads we refer very often to as cognitions. Cognitions. Our thought processes. For example if you went to Nepal, one of your motivations for going there might be to meditate or relax and that would be a cognition. It's something you would know within your own head. We have the various learning processes, how do we learn? That's quite an interesting one, if you consider as students how do you learn erm in general you probably don't learn that much in lectures because for example we know from experiments that we all have a limited attention span. Basically you will listen for maybe seven minutes then you switch off for two minutes then you switch on again and then you try and think well what was I listening to seven minu well you know, three minutes ago what was probably said in the last two minutes. By the time you've sussed that out, you've missed another five minutes, your brain gets confused so you then switch off again for another three minutes and try and clear everything. And you're doing this the whole time. But how do we actually learn? Taking information through your senses. Okay you take in right reading, listening From experience. From experience and there are also the occasions very often when you're, if you like, force fed. When you've got exams you have to learn. You have to be able to hold it up there and perhaps put it down on paper or apply it. We also learn from things like television. Most of you here, a great deal of your knowledge probably comes from watching television. Possibly more nowadays than, for example, from reading as would have been the case in the past. This is an interesting one, the interpersonal response. How do you interact with people when you go abroad? Are you the type who wants to go up to, you're on holiday in Spain, go up to a Spaniard go hola you know, and actually try and hold a conversation with them. Are you the type who thinks god there's someone from Spain over there, oh it's alright there's a load of people from my nationality in the bar and stick with them. Are you looking for the interaction where you learn something about the culture from talking to the people or do you want minimal interaction where simply you visit a place, and you stay in your little bubble or ghetto with people of your own tour company, you do everything together and you never come into contact with local people. Erm two if you like extremes and there's a lot of things in between. It doesn't incidentally mean that one is good and the other is bad. Er a lot of people give the impression that we should all be more interactive, that we should go abroad and speak languages to many of these people, but the people you come into contact with when you go on holiday in Spain, the only Spanish people are likely to be the waiter who served you and he's serving you as part of his job. His job is also to be friendly to you, to smile at you, you know, when you want it, so it's not really an equal relationship. It's very difficult, if you like, to develop a true friendship and exchange of ideas. The waiter very often will tell you what you want to hear. Yes? If you think about that, it's a very difficult situation. Attitudes are important, what attitudes do you hold. In particular, what prejudices. Do you have a prejudice against for example eating oily food? Do you have a prejudice against the French? Which a lot of English people do. Erm prejudices come from all sorts of things, some of them are historical, some of them are generated out of things like football and arguments in the evening about good teams. Prejudices, we're all born with them, they're if you like perceptions which are only changed very often through experience. We've then got general motivations themselves, which we listed. It's cheap price, good deal, that sort of thing. And finally perhaps your own personality as well. Are you an extrovert person outgoing, willing to take a chance, willing to take a risk or are you more introverted perhaps? What is traits? Traits means characteristics. Just to show you how this has developed, you don't need to copy this down, it's something that you'll do in the second year of your course, but we mentioned in particular here how you interact with people and what goes through your head. And this has actually been categorized into two tables and by , they claim that you can define different types of tourists according to, firstly, the way in which they interact with the local people. So at one extreme you've got the explorer who simply goes off into the unknown. The, the last thing the explorer wants on holiday is to meet people from their own country. Th they wanna get far away from it. They don't really like being called a tourist in many places. Many of them will use the term traveller because somehow it's less derogatory, it sounds more impressive. And these people here will learn languages, they will eat the local food, they will do anything the locals do, they will dress like them, the lot in order to try and get as full a experience as possible. At the other end, you have what we call the charter tourist. The person who goes there and basically they want to take their home with them. In the case of an Englishman they'll want to take their beer, steak and chips, everything over to simply a hot climate and they live in their bubble. So you have these two extremes. In between you have elite, offbeat, unusual, mass and so on but they all lie somewhere between these extremes in terms of totally interacting and totally ignoring in many cases. The second type is the cognitive normative. In other words, defining tourists according to what's actually going through their heads. And here for example you might have the recreational mind, healthy mind and body the existential, the person who as much as anything may be looking for an experience based on meditation, er religion, this sort of thing. Er you've got, also down here, experimental the person who experiments if you like with different cultures, trying to think of a different way, who's interested in religions. Now you may think that the number of people in this category here is very minimal, but there's increasing numbers of people around the world travelling now who are motivated by things like this. You only have to look at the number of visitors going to places such as Nepal er to see the increase there, to see how important this connection be. Now for our purposes, the kind of thing we're gonna do, is look at a much simpler breakdown of tourists. And this is gonna introduce you to a new word called psychographic and psychographic, you think you've got, you can break it in two you've got the psychological aspects and the graphic or mapping, the mapping of the psychology. And this has been translated by a gentleman by the name of Stanley Clog but we don't usually refer to it as Clog's theory or anything like that. And Stanley Clog identifies four different types of tourist and these are the main ones which we're gonna use. Two of them you'll of heard before I'm sure. The first one you won't have done. Psychocentrics are the first one. If you're a psychocentric tourist, you're the type of person who's self inhibited. You're perhaps a little nervous of change you haven't got really a desire for adventure or anything too challenging. You prefer well packaged routine holidays in popular tourism destinations and you're looking at the three Ss or four Ss we should say. So you're looking at a package holiday resort in Spain in the main. Okay, psychocentrics. Again, like to be in the crowds. The alternative are what we call alocentrics, these are outgoing people with varied interests. They're keen to explore, to find new things and they're likely to want independence. And in between these two we also have something called midcentrics who do bits of both, but these are the two extremes. So all of you in this room are either a psychocentric or probably an alocentric. The type of person who goes on this holiday is almost certainly gonna be a psychocentric. The type of person who goes on this holiday to destinations for example want somewhere unusual perhaps to India, is more likely to be an alocentric person cos they're getting away from the crowds. Okay so psychocentrics and alocentrics. So this is what Stanley Clog produced, now we're gonna add two more to this, two that you're all familiar with I'm sure, firstly, sunlust people. People who chase the sun beach holidays and there's a lust for a tan. So for example w I can't remember your name who's the girl next to you? Michelle. Michelle is obviously a sunlust person in that respect and depending on whether she goes to a main package resort in Spain or perhaps a beach in India, she can either be a psychocentric sunlust person or an alocentric sunlust person. And the alternative to this is wanderlust. The person who wants to explore, keep on the move and typified by some form of touring holiday. Okay so now whenever you look at a package holiday brochure, you should be able to identify the market just using two words sunlust alocentric, wanderlust psychocentric and so on. So if you're looking at a touring holiday in Europe it's wanderlust probably, and if it's an, a coach tour round Europe it's almost certain to be psychocentric. If you're looking for a tour around Borneo and Indonesia, that's away from the crowds so we can say it's an alocentric wanderlust. So it's a very simple way, if you like, for us to define markets fairly accurately. Okay can everybody understand that? Sunlust, wanderlust, psychocentrics and alocentrics. Right well you'll be doing a lot more of this in your marketing. Er I've got two handouts which I want you to pick up er now. One is something sp specifically written on the demand for the tourism product after nineteen ninety one. Try to highlight those factors or the determinants of demand which were gonna be important in buying the tourism products in nineteen ninety two. And the second is something on tourism decision making. This simply gives you, it's only a two page handout, it gives you some idea of the sort of motivations from what people have written about them. What I also want you to do on this is if you can refer to Adrian Bull's book, the Economics of Travel and Tourism, and just go through the relevant chapter on demand. Hello sir. How you doing? Not so good. What have you been up to then? Oh I think my health's breaking up. It's my ears and er my back. I w I was in and seeing the Doctor Mhm. and he's given me pills and that for it, but it's my ears . This is one that's been, I've had appointment and for three times I'd had to cancel it . buzzing in ears when I go to bed at night. Mhm. I'm not getting to sleep. It's taking me oh quite a while to get to sleep and, and I'm not hearing too good. Right. Let's have a look in and see if your brains are expanding or what's happening in here. No wonder you're not hearing so good. No wonder you're getting a buzzing in your ears there's a big lump of concrete in there. Is there? Let's have another look at this. Oh my. For goodness sake. There's a wee man with a pick and shovel in Oh aye. It's solid. Is it? Absolutely solid. I've been putting drops in it too Aye. quite regular. Aye. I'll, I'll need to give you some special stuff to loosen that. Aye. Because that's Because it's right? It's caught in the hairs Mhm. in the inside here and if we try and syringe it out it'll pull hairs out Aha. and irritate the skin. Aye. I'll give you some special stuff to get rid of that. Cos I've been trying and trying for ages to get that. No. It's the, it's absolutely solid. The, the drops are not not doing anything. seeing Doctor the other week. My back absolutely killing me. And I'm falling asleep every time I sit down. We'll need to do something about that. That's not right. Between that and my back and my knees it's . Two drops of this Aha. in the morning. A wee bit of cotton wool just on the outside. Same on the other side. Same at bedtime before you got to bed. Aha. Couple drops and Mhm. cotton wool. And that'll gradually loosen that up. Come back down in about a fortnight Aha. and we'll just a wee gentle syringe and it'll all come away. Smashing. No problem at Right. all. Now then. Thirty two Grove. Grove . Now is your insurance line due in about a fortnight ? Aye. Aye. Right. Here we are then and they'll have to get that sorted for . Great. Thanks. Okay. Right. Cheerio now. Cheerio. Do men hate women? Of course they don't! They respect, admire, like, and often love them! Don't they? Now why am I stirring in the age long war between the sexes? Isn't the sparring light hearted and fun underneath all the rough and tumble? Men really care for us, don't they? I mean, the things they say about women when they think they're alone, they're just jokes aren't they? Right? Well tell that to the marines! And that's the polite version, say many women! How many women? Let's see what this hundred women make of the question, do men hate women? Button one, and button two for no. Ge generally speaking, I mean as far as you can tell, living as long as you have done how would you answer that question? And in this hundred, sixty seven say no, but thirty three which is exactly a third, say yes! Who said yes, and why? I think misogyny is is very ancient, it's as old as man. It comes from Augustine Equinus it's come right down through literature and history. And perhaps, today we would not say that men actually hate women, but there aren't isn't much obli , er evidence of their respect. They're not willing to erm, recognise women as their equals. Why? Well I think it's been a mans world, they, they've had a wonderful time! Why, why should they give it up? I think erm like the main issue is that men are really afraid of woman and really Mhm. afraid of woman's power and the only way they know how to combat that is is to put out this kind of this hatred or or this misogyny in in the language in the way they behave towards women. But I think it's there, underneath it. Like fear, in trying to keep women down so that women can't discover their power, because women are just so powerful! And we're only just beginning to realise that. And what is the misogyny that they're putting out that you talk about? What is the evidence? Oh,it's just, you know it's incredible ! Like advertising erm language, you know like erm, any courses that you study most of the text books will always be in in male identified language. Yeah. Erm you get comments on the street! Mm. You know, in the pubs, oh! It's, it's so tremendous! Like it's just so huge, it it kind of feels quite overwhelming to even begin to combat it! Mm. I think that it's only a fear of women but it's also a belief in the innate or or learn superiority of men over women Mhm. so that men from a very early age learn that women are, are not important creatures, that they're not to be respected or erm understood certainly, and that they can be erm, beaten and abused and raped! I think er male society is built on women hatred! Erm, we hear a lot about the holocaust that happened to the Jews in the second world war but not so many people know a lot about the holocaust that has happened to women over centuries and centuries where millions of women were burnt as witches, but er, just because they were women! Sorry, I think this is a complete generalisation Mhm. of men! Men, there are men who hate women, I agree with that but there are men who love and respect a a th what a woman is for how how good and and stre , the strength of women who can make you feel good and who who gives you the power of being able to be yourself and I I'm sorry I I, that is part of it, I think there are two sides. Mhm. I think a lot of men do hate women, I think a lot of men don't. But I think the problem is that many men who hate women don't realise that they hate women. They think, for example, the feller who sleeps with a lot of women, he says oh I love women! I adore them! And he doesn't realise that he's abusing and using them Mm. because it's accepted. It's, you know, he's a Jack the lad or whatever! And I think that's a, you know and it's the fact that society allows a lot of abuse to happen to women and therefore it's not seen as hatred to women, it's seen as perfectly acceptable. Mhm. Yes? Yes, I think really it's a er, faulty gene in the system and no matter how men hate women, the majority of men really like women other than perhaps envy, or jealousy, or women earning more than their husbands and throwing it back in them, in their face, but the main subject, the main point to me is, there is a faulty ge gene in their system and there's no way you will eradicate that! That's a rather gloomy view! But, is it is is is that true? Yes? Well what about the images that men see of women every day in page Mm. three? I don't think that's respecting or liking women, that's just making them as sex objects! That Mm. I can't see that as being loving a woman. Mhm. If men like women so much where are the men who are speaking about what other men are doing to women? Where are the men who are speaking out about the abuse of women in the home? Where Mhm. are the men speaking out about rape and sexual assault of women? It's women who are speaking about it, out Mhm. about these issues, not men! Well I think men really do believe that they are better than women. They don't want to recognise that we're equal. I mean, they're the ones that point out, no, we can't do that, that's women's work! Mm. You don't hear women saying I can't do that cos that's a man's job! Mhm. Up there? I think it's actually still inbuilt in erm children's minds, and I think it's sometimes the mother's own fault because they still bring them up, you know like, girls will do this and boys will do that, I think that is actually still still there, you know. So you don't think it's the faulty gene that Marian talked about, you think it's in the ? Yeah I agree , I actually agree with that as well because erm, I have a son and I think and he's brought up by myself and there's no man about, you know, so well I think it's actually inbuilt in the man that he you know, that he's actually like that. Beside you. I think one women that most men dislike is the mother-in-law! The mother-in-law gets the brunt of everything! Prove mother-in-law's wrong, no matter what she tries to do, she's wrong! All Yes. men seem to say that! Are you talking from experience? Well I shouldn't ask you that should I? Erm, I I think it's less a problem to be thought that men hate women so much it is alright to be rude about women. Mm. I compiled an anthology a few years ago about, of misogynist quotes, and it's everything from the bible, the Koran, the Hindu, to, every religion's in there, all the judges are in there, pop singers are in there, I mean everybody under the sun! And the things they say yo you read them and you think, oh yes, that's pretty awful! But like er, all women are evil and are the cause of all the evil in the world, says Shirley Bassey! And you think well you know, that's going to sell her lots of records and it's jolly good! But if you changed it and said all black people are evil and are the cause of all the evil the world! It gets your flesh creeping Mhm. in a way that it wouldn't if you said women! And I think that's where the danger comes as it's a sort of acceptable thing to say! One, very easy way to find out how much men dislike women is not to behave they wa , the way they want you to behave! Mm mm. So, I mean a a true real example is you get drunk men in a pub Mhm. they came up to you if there's two women together they assume that they have the right to talk to you, that you're going to be interested in them, and if you tell them to get lost however politely, you can get a very, very unpleasant response because they assume that what they have to say is more important! Mhm. Up there. I think this is not, is more evident within marriage. Erm, I think the idea is that a woman is a man's possession, that she should be subservient, she should do as she's told and that she has no intelligent to think intelligence to think for herself! Erm, one er main area I think, is in, when it comes to domestic violence. Now, if you, if a woman gets hurt and she goes to the police for help they come to the house and they tell the people concerned it's a domestic argument! What still? So , it's still a domestic argument, sort it out for yourself! The wo , it seems to be the age old theory that women should do as they're told! If a , the violence is within marriage it should be sorted out within the marriage which I, you know, I don't agree with. Has that not changed at all over, over recent years? I mean has er er are there not more enlightened attitudes? Yes? I think th the the publicity that the police give out about the Mm. their attitudes would, would lead you believe that they have changed and they have become more receptive to the kind of things women have been saying over the years. But I think if you listen the stories of women themselves, er, who are abused in the home and who call the police, I think you would find that the same old attitudes are still erm been found. Mhm. You do read terrible stories in the papers every day of men who've murdered their wives, get off even though they've chopped their wives into a hundred bits, driven to the Lake District overnight, dumped the body and gone back Mm mm. his school sports and said I did it for the sake of the children! And they get let off for that! Mm. You know, they say oh she moved the mustard pot one morning and it really irritated me so much I killed her! And the judges sympathize with it, that's that's a Mm. that's a dangerous Yes? Mm. There was one place quite recently Mhm. when erm the wo the woman had nagged her husband, the husband killed her and she got le , oh he didn't get let off but he, he got erm I think he walked from the court because the Sheriff said the wife had nagged you for erm he, she did have to be killed! I mean Mm. this is what we're coming up against! Mhm. I think it's really important to er, define this this brief that it's women responsibility to change men, and to change their sums. Because er, inevitably man has gotta leave their home, even if they've had a father erm who's been a if they've had no father at all, they're gonna leave and they're gonna face a world where they have to be a man and they're gonna have to find their own male morals, and I think the, the responsibility, basically, has gotta come to men to change not for us to change them. Yes, we have to fight for our equality, for our own rights but w we can change men and our, the responsibility is not for women to change men, it's for women to change our own lives, our own situations, and for we , men to change their own. Well there's much talk at the moment about what's called the backlash effect, that in fact,th the any advances that the feminist movement may have made on behalf of er of women is having precisely the, wrong effect and er and men are are reasserting their the their more old fashioned style. I don't know if you would agree with that or what you think of that, and one might to combat that if you agree that is does exist? Yes? Well er, I don't really think there's been enough improvement to backlash against and er One of the things I would like say is, that although many things have changed a lot of things have stayed very much the same Mm. and perhaps some of the have arguably grown worse. I'm thinking really of the way misogyny has become a sort of public spectacle Mm. and the subject of so much popular entertainment! You know, er, Twin Peaks, The Silence of the Lambs Mhm. erm, American Psycho whatever! I mean er, video games which turn on the chopping up of women, I think there's real misogyny there and it's saturates our public media, you know real erm undiluted women hatred! And parents are really not alone in in bringing up their children, their children are exposed to all sorts of outside influences, through the media, in their peer groups, and those in many ways, I think, are getting worse rather than better. Yes? Things like the diet industry Yeah. the diet industry is teaching us to hate our bodies Mhm. so that we spend millions of pounds on, on diet aids that we don't need at all! Mhm. That's, misogyny! Yes? I would, I worry terribly much about this discussion and it was suggesting that men are somehow the root of all evil and all Mm. all the things that happen, all these sighs of oppression, because I think really what we're talking about, whether it be within the family or it be within the media, all the signs of women as er sexist Mhm. images or whatever, aren't so much to do with misogyny, some horrible male plot, some patriarch or conspiracy, it's to do with the way our society is run and I think that's, we look far more at class. I feel more allegiance, if you like, with er, a male working class person than I do perhaps with a female member of the class, Margaret Thatcher would be a very good example of that. I feel far mo , less sympathy and far less identification with her than I perhaps do with a male worker who has to cope with the same kind of exploitation that I do, day in, day out. I think that really is perhaps where, where perhaps, examples of oppression come from, I, the structure of society rather than men being evil. What do you think of that view? Yes? Well if, if you look at erm a female worker, er as opposed to a male worker and you look at the o oppression that she suffers, does she not suffer both the oppression of being working and the oppression of being a woman? So, to me she was more oppressed than her male counterpar part. Sure , she suffers both if you like, she suffers from oppression of being Yeah. a female in society and she suffers the exploitation of being a,be being a worker, of course that, but the a ruling class woman doesn't suffer from exploitation. Deborah? Well I'm, I think er, although I have no personal time for Mrs Thatcher politically at all, I think she's an absolutely classic victim of misogyny. That the way in which Mrs Thatcher was depicted, criticized you know, ditch the bitch! All those kinds of slogans were a very good example of how er, women hating comes to the fore whenever women get in positions women are not supposed to be in. I agree with you that Mrs Thatcher is a representative of her class, first and foremost, but I think the way she was treated showed up a lot of rather unpleasant things about the er the political movements which opposed her. I wish somebody here would define exactly what misogyny is! I thought it meant a man who hated a woman. It seems to me that the discussion right now is that we are all seeing all men hate all women! Mm. And that is not true! Some men hate some women. Yeah, I have worked all my life in various jobs and I've never yet met a man who hated me nor have I hated any man, and I think there must be many women here who think the same thing. So, all men do not hate all women! Would you recognise that we live a society where some men hate women and are able to use whatever power and influence they have to project an image of women which is which is hateful? No! I I, I think it depends Right. on your own attitude. I've Does never encountered it. Right. I would agree with er, the lady behind strongly! I mean I think that I would, really a lot of what we're talking about here is actually male chauvinism Mhm. and I Yeah! deal a lot with men Yeah. in in my course of work, I have three grown up sons and I think an awful lot of what we're talking about is in your own attitude to men, and generally the most difficult men to deal with, I find, are men who for whatever reason, are actually inadequate, a little bit sensitive to women being competent I I have no difficulty at all in dealing with that, but I I'm aware that it seems significant to me that a lot of the younger women here are much more shall we say, sensitive to erm, what I perceive as being basically male chauvinism. I'm not excusing violence, domestic violence, I Mm. consider that to be exceptional, I'm talking about the general. There. Yes? I think the evidence though is that men like okay, we're talking generally, but if you look at the evidence of how many women are raped, one in four of girl children are molested before the age of sixteen, that to me suggests hatred! I mean, the statistics for boy children being molested, there, there are boy children are molested but the statistics are nowhere near as large! Like, so many women are raped! So many women are beaten! So many women are molested when they're really, really young! And that to me looks like hatred, that looks like trying to destroy femininity, something that is beautiful. Let's le let let me, let me take a couple of er votes. Have you ever been raped? Button one for yes, button two for no. I'm not going to pursue anybody on this one so I mean I'm not yo you ca you can answer with er with impunity. Now fourteen people in this hundred have said yes, which I think is is is shocking! Have you, have you ever been physically abused by a man? Button one for yes, button two for no. And that's ha, even more shocking! Fifty three people have said yes, they've been physically abused. And have you ever been emotionally abused by a man, is the final question I'll ask at this stage? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And there we have e have phwurgh, seventy six people have said yes, they've been emotionally abused by a man. Now, maybe, maybe that is male chauvinism, that the status quo, that's, that's just how life is, is it? I mean how, how would you respond to those particular votes? Well you know er, as I said, I think really an awful lot of it is in your own perception of, I mean what someone here might call emotional abuse, I would just regard as a challenge. I really don't necessarily find every time a man and I'm perfectly aware of the fact that Yes. a lot of men are not very good at taking a women's opinion but I don't necessarily regard that as a translation into some form of male misogyny. Okay. Some men hate men! Some men hate people full stop! They Aha. hate children! They dimi , they hate animals. some women do and I'm not quite clear that it has to be so definite as as er There. some people feel. I think a lot of mis misogyny is behind the scenes in the all Yeah. male world of the the guilds, the working men's clubs, the freemasons, the rotarians, and even the pubs which have a predominately male culture and we don't know what they're saying about us behind our back and I think that is why there's so much naivety about. Just like to ask the hundred women here, we have the Chippendales, and we have the men from Texas now we always hear that they're sell-outs, you know Mm. th , is the woman going there to abuse the men or to humiliate them why is it such a sell-out then? What , yes? I think that, that there's a o , clearly a very different history behind erm the use of women as sex objects and the use of men as sex objects, and a fundamental difference is that erm the, the background to erm using women as sexual objects in pornography or in prostitution is that is sexual violence, the wo the women can be raped or can be beaten i i in a sexual way and and that simply is not the case with men who are used as sexual objects. So I think it's it's erm, it's a non-issue. Mhm. Yeah, I would just like to add something to that, and the fact that it's not only that women, that, that men are taught that they can rape and they can abuse women, but er that it's alright! I can walk out or , and get erm, you know tonnes of any any shop I can get pornography that tells me that, or tell any man who chooses to buy that magazine that's it okay to take a women even if she says no. It's okay to rape a women. It's okay to rough, to be hard, to push, to rape! You can get magazines who tell Mm. you that that's okay and that women even enjoy that! If that's misogyny I don't what misogyny is! Mhm. Well years ago I I was at a party which was er, for a woman about to be married and there was a male stripper there. And, the women were it was very jokey, it was very jolly and lots of titters and things I'm not making comment on whether I think it's a good thing Aha. or a bad Aha. thing. I have also been to a strip show which involved a woman, in a, in a club and it was a very different atmosphere. Men were making all kinds of really negative remarks Mm mm. about the woman, you know, oh she's got a, she's got a mole on her backside! Ooh I wouldn't have her! Or, I I can't re , I won't repeat here the things they said, but you know spread it, or get it out or whatever! You know, really demeaning things! Very, very aggressive! Very hateful! Now, getting back to the comment the woman made earlier about men being misogynist within their own world I'm quite convinced that a good deal of those men would go home to their wives and family and be very loving to their, to their wives and family, be respectful of their neighbours but as soon as they got in the all male environment, and this woman was there to be used, she was their property for the time that they paid their money to get through the door, they could be as misogynist, offensive and horrid as they wanted to be! Mm. You see, I think, I mean thi thi it's it's been discussed seventy er seven of you said no, men don't hate women and yet some of the discu , a lot of the discussion and certainly the votes you taken give a very gloomy picture! And few people ar , a couple of suggestions have come up th th th , say that it, things will only change when men actually decide they're going to change, when men feel that's it's intolerable to live a society where the kind of things which have been discussed, whether it's the th th pornography or the the various abuses of women are seen as as just not being acceptable any more. Do you think that's ever going to happen Oh sure! or do you think The difficulty is that all the religions of the world have text books which are still studied, which all say that women are stupid, women are wicked, women are property, and women are revolting! You know, you're all taught that from childhood and always have been. I don't quite know how you change it. Things have gone er, better for women they have, in the restoration of a women publishers and there weren't any in last century, you know i er things go they seem to swing backwards and forwards all the time. But as a compiler And we stay in the same place! As a compiler of an anthology of er, of misogynist er, quotes, was it hard to find them? No! But I di I mean I didn't even have to look, you see, you Yeah. just, everything you read you just you can just Yeah. fillet it all out. I'm, I'm not a writer of these sort of books, I write theatre history Mm. and I'm an actress, that's my job, you know. But, I just came across so much of it every where I was, I thought actually there there's a book in this because it used to get, just get me so cross writing theatre history and, and reading these terrible things! There. Yes? As soon as a a a a a woman, erm or a lady stands up to be counted she's looked about, she's looked at as being aggressive, not assertive, as first it's aggressive because they think it's the challenge again. Instead of realizing that they have a right to to say, if God has no respect for persons, why should men be? I'd like to go back to what the lady across there said about the strip show Yes. now do I don't suppose I'm the only person that's been in a pub toilet, a ladies toilet and I've heard the females in the toilet saying what, exactly what they would like to do the males! So I don't think that erm all lad , all females are ladies. I'm, I'm going to try a little experiment which er, which may not work. I I did say to you at the beginning do you think er men hate women? An and you voted on it. Can I ask you the same question again ho , after this discussion, do you think men hate women? Button one for yes, and button two for no. I have to say, myself, you know I feel one of the worst thing you can call a man in the English language is a term that's used for a women's genitalia. I er I, well there isn't another word that women can actually use, it does, it does make me wonder. However, well now then th the er, the vote's changed. Thirty three of you thought that men hated women before, now it's gone down to thirty one so so any of you gentleman watching who have bruised egos yo you have your supporters here. E er any any final word? Yes? Erm, I think it's quite interesting what you just said about er men using the, the word cunt, which actually I can't broadcast I think that, could you say that again? Okay. men using the wo er, female genitalia as a a derogatory term and if we actually go back to the roots of that word erm, to me it's like basic shows you what misogyny's about the actual root of that word it means, seat of power. And, our women's power, and men are scared of our power! So you would like to reclaim a word that I'm not Oh yeah! allowed to broadcast? Yeah! I think we should all be able to say that word and feel proud about it. How many additions of Scottish women will there be before we can do that? Yes? I think, I think you do need to look at power, I think that's quite a crucial er Mm. area that we need to think about. A lot of women here have said it's up to women, it's up to mothers Mm. but I mean, if you look at where cultural power is who has control over images that we see, books that we read, films that we go and see? I think it's very interesting, the film Cape Fear, that's out at the moment, which says, is the scariest film you'll ever see. And the fear there is the same fear as walking down the road in, at night wondering if you're going to be raped! Mm. It actually works on the fear of rape. And that's that's gonna be a box office hit! I think we need to look at who has control over what we see. Have you ever complained about an an image or an advert or a film? I mean, have you ever written to anyone or phoned anyone? My complaining was only effective cos we actually took direct action over some advertising for erm swim wear. Erm, yeah we, we did take direct action and so eventually the ad was dropped, but if we'd just complained and not taken any action the ad wouldn't have been dropped. What is direct action? Were yo Wasn't exactly legal! Did it involve th , I mean a spray can or er It actually involved destroying erm, some of the product to just to indicate women were about it. And it I see. was only after then, only after actually threatening property that the ad was dropped. Before that, they wouldn't drop it. Well it would be irresponsive of me to say there's a lesson for you in that! I shall simply say thank you all very much indeed. And thank you for joining us. Goodbye. Hello. Well Hello. monster? Aha. What've I to do to you today? No, it's not him, it's me Doctor . Is it mum? Mum. What'd you do to your mum? mum for a while. Were you bad to her? Were you bad to your mum? What can I do for you? My bust again Doctor . I'm having terrible pains in my chest. It's only the, the right one, Mhm. that I have any pains in. Now I keep taking this Shelabruse it clears, and it comes back. You know how sometimes you get a lot of vein running down Mhm. your bust? Well it's sinking in, it, it goes into your grove. Mhm. But it's still the same, but it's the pains that I got the last time that's gon it's like sharp pains that's going round about, just the insides of the nipple. I have put a wee bit of weight on, so I was wondering if it was maybe Mhm. that. Mhm. Could be that. But it's been for about two month now, but it's For two months? aha. Are you on anything just now No. to try and ease the soreness, Cathy? No. No. It isn't, it's not a pain that's there all the time, Doctor . It just comes. It just comes. Is it a sharp sort of shooting pain? Very sharp it's as though something's bursting. You know, something's Mhm. running, it's like that. Right. Stop that for you . I had an appointment and I cancelled it, a couple of month ago, because it wasn't too bad. Then I had to get this one. Right. Now then this er I was going to cancel this. Better not to. Better not to. Er my mother's waiting to come in, so I was going to give her it. Will we give your mum nice medicine or rotten medicine? Oh he's not really sort of speaking to me. Is he in a bad mood? Aye . In a bad mood this morning? Are you? Wee boy playing with the toys out there and they told him to shut up. Is your gran out there? His gran's out there. Is she? No well. What've you been doing to your gran? Were you bad to your gran? There we are. What is this Doctor ? Will you take that for your mum? That's a boy. Two things Cathy. I've given you something to try and take the swelling off your chest, and that should ease a bit of the pain but I've also given you er stuff to stop all this bursting Mhm. on the inside. So now, I want you to use that for a full month, and come back up, and let us know how things are doing. Will do. . That should give you a good help with that. Just too heavy busted, I think that's what's . No no no no no no no, it's nothing to do with that, I wish it was as simple as that. Right. Wish it was as simple as that. Okay Doctor , Right Gary? thank you. Right, cheerio now. Cheerio Cathy. Come in. Good morning. Morning . You're a stranger. Aye. What can we do for you this morning ? It's my pills.

Cheerio now. Right ladies and gentlemen, we will no will now continue. Erm Mr ,? Sir, I don't know whether this would be a convenient moment, but I have taken instructions on the the Oh yes, quite. the which er was raised er Yes. and also raised by your colleague erm with regard to the decisions of the Parish Council. Yes. Sir, reference to my appendix number five makes it clear that there was some lack of knowledge er by those in the village er round about June nineteen ninety two as to what was going on in Ryedale with regard to the site north of Skelton. And you will see there as appendix five Yes. a copy of a letter from the Chief Planning Officer of Ryedale, to Yes. Mr who is on my right, and who was previously the chairman of the Southern Area Planning Committee of Ryedale District Council, but not at that time,which explains that erm a change was in hand. Yes. And the Parish Council was thereupon alerted to this fact and held a meeting on the seventeenth of July nineteen ninety two,the relevant part of the minute of which reads as follows. It is minute number fifteen. Yes. The council oppose proposed changes relating to amendment of the greenbelt plan by excluding two fields on the northwestern edge of the village from the greenbelt. The council felt the proposed inset boundary of the village should remain as published in the original consultation and proposals documents , and that in itself indicates, sir, a minor degree of confusion, sir. The Parish Council even at that stage was not fully aware of the situation. They were referring to the deposit copy. should remain as published in the original documents, and were surprised at the proposed changes raised at the eleventh hour prior to a public enquiry, in September nineteen ninety two. The original proposed boundary of the greenbelt was tightly drawn against properties in the village, and the proposed changes are inconsistent with this. Also, the proposed changes would intrude upon the Skelton conservation area . That sir is the end of that minute. Yes, right. Thank you. Could we have copies of the minute, do you think ? Er w you wish to have a copy of the whole document sir ? No. Right. Well not necessarily but if copies could be made of that page . Yes . Yes. Thank you very much . I'm still a little bit in the dark. I'd like to read read the minute . Yes. Right. Erm perhaps we can leave it till I have read it then and Yes. Right. then if there's anything more to be said I'll I'll say it then. Yes, right, thank you very much. Right thank you. Mr , do you have any questions? Sir, I adopt the cross examination . Right, thank you very much. Right, well we'll move on then please. Mr Ward. Thank you very much sir. I'll call Mrs then to present Yes, thank you. the County's evidence. Thank you very much. Erm Yes. Yes please. Mrs , I'll ask you if you would please to read the summary of your proof of evidence from document N Y Two Three Seven. Objections to the deposit plan have been received concerning two adjoining sites at the northern end of Skelton, topic area D thirty nine which is a paddock, and topic area D forty which is a small field between the paddock and the A Nineteen. In respect of D thirty nine, the objection is that the paddock should be included within the greenbelt. The objections to D forty are that the field should be excluded from the greenbelt. Could I say at this stage,i is anybody having difficulty hearing at the back? C could I suggest firstly you move forward to the front row er on both sides, because th there's little point in er asking Mrs to speak louder if . Thank you. Move closer to the public rather than further away from them. In April nineteen ninety two, the County Council reassessed the greenbelt boundary around Skelton and resolved to propose a change to exclude topic area D forty from the greenbelt. Two objections have been received to the proposed change. Obje objection site D thirty nine extends to some one point two five hectares and is bounded on three sides by hedgerows, trees and tracks, and on the south side by the boundary with existing property . Objection site D forty is an area of grassland that is that is split in two by a post and rail fence. It extends to some one point four hectares. Hedges and trees mark three of the boundaries, with the southern boundary being a post and rail fence along Church Lane in the curtilage of . The County Council considers that the two sites do not fulfil any greenbelt purpose. In the County Council's opinion, the northern boundary of the site, which comprises variously a line of trees, hedge and track, effectively acts as a screen between the site and the open agricultural land to the north, and can adequately prevent any sprawl of the village or encroachment onto the open agricultural land, and will not therefore prejudice the special character of York. None of the other greenbelt purposes are relevant to these sites. The deposit plan greenbelt boundary and amended , is a well-defined durable boundary, and is therefore an appropriate boundary. The County Council has noted that noted the representation that the greenbelt boundary around Skelton should follow the edge of the built-up area for its entirety. However, the County Council takes the view that the objection sites do not fulfil any greenbelt purposes, and should not, therefore, be included in the greenbelt, whereas elsewhere around Skelton, any relaxation of the boundary would result in encroachment into the open countryside, to the detriment of the greenbelt. The objectors have raised various development control issues concerning the site. While the County Council has noted these points, it does not consider that they are relevant to the definition of greenbelt boundaries. For the reasons outlined above the County Council remains of the opinion that the two sites to the north of Skelton should be excluded from the greenbelt and included within the Skelton village inset. Thank you Mrs . Thank you very much. Mr ,. Mrs ,you attach considerable importance to the physical characteristics of boundaries, don't you? drawing of greenbelt boundaries, attention should be paid to ensure that the greenbelt boundaries are enduring. To that extent, they should follow physical features on the ground. And when you have looked at Skelton as a whole,you have concluded,apparently, from your paragraph seven point seven,that any relaxation of the greenbelt boundary elsewhere around Skelton would result in an unwarranted extension of the built-up area, contrary to the objectives of the York greenbelt. For what reason do you believe that a relaxation, as you put it, of the greenbelt boundary from the deposit copy to the line you now propose, north of this important village, would not do so? In as much that er in the County Council's opinion these two s these two paddock, fields, whatever you call them, to the north of Skelton are visually more related to the village, whereas the other land around Skelton is clearly open agricultural land and therefore forms part of the open countryside around Skelton. Am I to believe from that that you regard the characteristics of the open countryside around Skelton as being more important for greenbelt purposes and the contribution to York than the land within the boundary you now propose? But the purpose of the of the greenbelt is to prevent encroachment into the open countryside. As I have just said we don' the County Council does not consider that these two fields form part of the open countryside around Skelton. Are you not by adopting that view, Mrs , abandoning the concept of the importance of the character of Skelton in relation to the setting of historic York? Not at all. I expect that the paddock in particular contributes to the character of Skelton, and inclusion in the conservation area. However, these two sites are more part of the character of Skelton, and their inclusion or exclusion from the er inclusion in the greenbelt wouldn't add any further to the character of Skelton and this part of the area . Development of this land would detract from the character of Skelton wouldn't it? That may be. What then is your primary reason for reducing the safeguard against development which greenbelt protection affords, bearing in mind that Skelton is a village of considerable character? Well,the purpose of the County Council is to draw up a greenbelt local plan, and therefore it is a question of whether or not the sites fulfil or do not fulfil a greenbelt purpose. The County Council is not concerned with the future uses of the land . How do you square that view with the view of your colleague that the whole of the village of Flaxton performed a greenbelt purpose? Sorry, I'm not aware of Flaxton. I mean Flaxton's beyond the six-mile limit for the greenbelt. I'm not quite sure what you're talking about . Could you keep your voice up please Mrs ? I I'm having difficulties and I'm sure those at the back are . Sorry, it's cos I'm turning this . Well if if you aim for the microphone , not because of if i any importance it has, but simply because in that way the centre of the room. Mrs , the primary purpose of the York greenbelt is to have an effect on the character of historic York, is it not? It is to protect the historic character of York. And That's one of the purposes, yes, And it has And it has has it not been admitted in at least one of your background documents that the character of the settlements round York have a part to play in that? Yes, in our document N Y Two which sets out the objectives of the York greenbelt in more detail. Erm it is the character of the s setting of the villages IN THE FOLD] And as soon as he got to the top he jumped out of the bucket and ran off at top speed. So poor Mrs. Goat had to stay there at the bottom of the well until the farmer came and found her, half dead with cold. When at last she was rescued she found that she had only exchanged one prison for another, for the farmer put her into the fold with his own sheep and goats, and so she lost her liberty for ever. [Illustration] [Illustration: THREE FRIENDS] THE THREE MONKEYS There were once three monkeys who were going for a voyage in a balloon. (This was in Monkey-land, far, far away and ever so long ago.) The three were so much alike that it was impossible to tell one from the other, and to make matters worse each of them answered to the name of James. Such a thing would never do in the crew of a balloon, so the old monkey who was in command decided that each of the three should have a different name. The first was to be called James, the second Jemmy, and the third Little James. So far so good. The three monkeys climbed into the balloon, the ground ropes were untied, and the voyage was begun. When they had reached a height of some hundreds of feet, the captain wished to give an order, so he called to the first monkey: "James!" "Aye aye, sir," said all the three, running up to him. "I called James," said the captain, looking from one to the other. "Well, I am James," answered the first monkey. "No, no. James is my name," said the second. "And mine too," said the third. "How can you be James if I am he?" cried the first angrily. "I tell you James is my name!" cried the second. "No, mine!" And so the three monkeys began to quarrel and dispute. Words led to blows, and soon they were tumbling about all over the car of the balloon, biting, scratching, and pummelling while the captain sat in his chair and bawled to them to stop. Every minute it seemed as though the car would overturn, and the end of it was that Little James got pushed over the side. He turned a beautiful somersault, and fell down, down, down through the air, landing in a soft bed of mud, into which he sank so that only his face and the top of his yellow cranium were visible. "Help! help!" bawled Little James at the top of his voice. Up ran a pair of monkeys belonging to the neighbourhood and stood looking at him. "He's in the mud, brother," said one. "Up to his neck," said the other. "How silly!" And they both began to grin. "Help!" cried Little James again, more faintly, for he was sinking deeper, and the mud was nearly at the level of his mouth. "Pull me out! Pull me out!" "Ah, but how?" asked the first monkey, looking at him gravely. "Wait a minute," cried the second, "I have an idea!" and he pulled out of his pocket one of those leather suckers on a string which boys use to lift stones. Moistening the disc, he clapped it on to Little James's head, and began to tug on the cord with all his might. "Hey!" cried the other monkey, running to help. "Pull, brother, pull, and we'll soon have him out!" [Illustration: LITTLE JAMES GOT PUSHED OVER THE SIDE] _Crack!_ The cord snapped suddenly, and the two monkeys tumbled head over heels. Never mind; they got another cord to repair the damage, and this time they succeeded in pulling Little James clear of the mud. Did I say Little James? Alas! it was only half of him! His rescuers had pulled so hard that he had broken off short in the middle, and his two legs were left embedded in the mud. [Illustration: "PULL, BROTHER, PULL, AND WE'LL SOON HAVE HIM OUT"] "Dear me!" said the first monkey, scratching his head. "This is very sad. The poor fellow has lost his legs. What shall we do?" "Let us make him some wooden ones!" said the other. So said, so done. They made him a beautiful pair of wooden legs, and Little James hobbled painfully home. By the time he reached his house he felt so ill that he went straight to bed. "I believe I am going to die," he said to himself. "I must make my will and set down the cause of my death." So he sent for pen and paper and began to write. Before very long, however, he stopped and began to scratch his head in perplexity. "If I am going to die," he thought, "I must be going to die of something! Now, what am I going to die of? This must be carefully considered, for above all one must write the truth in one's last testament!" So he pondered and pondered, but he could not make up his mind as to the cause of his death. Was he going to die of the fall from the balloon, or of his broken legs, or what? Just then he happened to look in the mirror by the bedside, and saw that there was a lump on his forehead, which he had got while fighting with James and Jemmy in the balloon. "Why, of course," cried he, "I am going to die of that big bruise on my forehead!" So he wrote it down in his will, and then, happy at having solved the difficulty, turned over on his side and died. And, as I said before, this all took place in Monkey-land, ever so long ago. [Illustration] [Illustration: BIRDS] HOW THE GOLDFINCH GOT HIS COLOURS When the Angel whose mission it was to colour the birds had finished his work, he began to scrape his palette and to make ready for departure. He had done his task well, for the plumage of the feathered creatures all around him glowed with a thousand glorious colours. There was the lordly eagle, arrayed in a robe of golden brown. The peacock had a tail of shimmering blue and green that looked as if it were studded with precious stones. The crow's black coat shone in the sun with a kind of steely radiance, very wonderful to behold. The canary was as yellow as a buttercup; the jay had a spot of blue sky on either wing; even the humble sparrow wore a handsome black neck-tie; while Chanticleer, the cock, was resplendent in yellow, black, and red. All the birds were very proud of their appearance, and they strutted about here and there, gazing at their reflections in the water and calling upon their neighbours to come and admire their beauties. [Illustration: THE ANGEL WHOSE MISSION IT WAS TO COLOUR THE BIRDS] Alone among the birds the little goldfinch took no part in the rejoicing. Somehow or other the Angel had overlooked him, so that he remained uncoloured, a drab little creature, in his sober grey dress, among the gaily clothed throng. More than once he had tried to draw the Angel's attention to himself, and now, seeing him cleaning his palette in readiness to depart, he stepped forward and said: "Have pity on me, good Angel, and paint my plumage as you have painted that of the others, so that I may walk among them unashamed. I have nothing to commend me--no beautiful song like the nightingale or the throstle, no grace of form such as the swallows have. If I am to go unadorned, nothing remains for me but to hide myself among the leaves." [Illustration: HE TOOK A PLACE AMONG THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEM ALL] Then the Angel took pity on the little creature, and would gladly have painted him with glowing colours, but alas, he had scraped his palette clean. Therefore he took up a brush, and going from bird to bird took from each a spot of colour, which he laid upon the goldfinch, blending a score of brilliant hues with marvellous skill. When he had finished, the tiny bird was transformed, and from being the saddest in that brilliant company he took a place among the most beautiful of them all. [Illustration: ALL THE BIRDS WERE VERY PROUD OF THEIR APPEARANCE] It is not possible, by means of words, to describe the beauty of the colouring which the Angel gave to the goldfinch, but you may see him any day you like, sitting on a thistle, and chirping his song of gratitude and praise. [Illustration] [Illustration: THE FOX WAS NOT A LITTLE FRIGHTENED] THE COCK AND THE FOX This is the story that the old woman who was called Tante Sannie told to the little boy who would always be talking: A long time ago (she said) there lived in a farmyard a Cock who was very proud of himself, and with reason, too, for he was, indeed, a plump and handsome bird. Nothing could have been finer than his appearance when he strutted through the yard, lifting his feet high as he walked, and nodding his head at each step. He had a magnificent comb of coral-red, and blue-black plumage streaked with gold, which shone so brilliantly when the sun flashed on it that it was a joy to see him. No wonder that his twenty wives gazed at him admiringly and followed him wherever he went, and were quite content to let him hustle them about and gobble up all the fattest worms and the finest grains of corn. If this Cock was proud of his appearance, there was one thing of which he was even prouder, and that was his voice. He was a famous songster; he could crow you high and he could crow you low; he could utter tones as deep as the pealing of the organ in church or as shrill as the blast of a trumpet. Every morning, when the first streak of dawn appeared in the sky, he would get down off his perch, raise himself on his toes, stretch out his neck, close his eyes and crow so loudly that he roused people who were sleeping in the next parish. And this he loved to do, because it was his nature. Now in the forest close to the farmyard there lived a Fox who had often gazed with longing eyes upon the plump and handsome bird. His mouth watered every time he thought of him, and many were the artful tricks he played to try and catch him for his dinner. One day he hid himself among the bushes in the garden by the farmyard and waited patiently until the Cock happened to stray his way. After a time the bird came along, pecking here and pecking there, wandered through the gate into the garden, and made straight for the bush under which Master Fox was hidden. He was just going to run into the bush after a butterfly which was fluttering about, when he caught sight of Reynard's black snout and cunning, watchful eyes, and with a squeak of alarm he jumped aside, just in time, and hopped on to the wall. At this the Fox rose to his feet. "Don't go away, my dear friend," said he in honeyed tones. "I would not for the world do you any harm. I know that it is my bad fortune to be disliked by your family--I can't for the life of me think why, and it is a pity, because I have to hide myself for the pleasure of hearing you sing. There is no cock in all these parts has such a magnificent voice as yours, and I simply do not believe the stories they tell about you." "Eh, what is that?" said the Cock, stopping at a safe distance and looking at the Fox with his head on one side. "What do they say?" "Why," Reynard went on, edging a little nearer, "they tell me that you can only crow with your eyes open. They say that if you were to shut your eyes, that clarion call of yours would become only a feeble piping, like the clucking of a new-born chick. But of course I don't believe them. Any one can see they are merely jealous." "I should think so," cried the Cock, bristling with anger. "Crow with my eyes shut, indeed! Why, I never crow in any other way. Just look here--I'll prove it to you!" And he raised himself on his toes, stretched out his neck, closed his eyes, and was just going to crow, when, _Snap!_ the Fox sprang upon him and caught him in his teeth! Then began a great to-do! The poor cock flapped his wings and struggled as the Fox ran off with him. The hens ran about the yard clucking and squawking, and the noise they made alarmed the farmer's wife, who was cooking in the kitchen. Out she came running, with the rolling-pin in her hand, and, seeing the fox with the cock in his mouth, gave chase, shrieking as she ran. The farm-hands tumbled out of barn and byre armed with pitch-forks, spades, and sticks. All the beasts began to raise a clatter, and what with the shouting of the men, the squealing of the pigs, the neighing of the horses, and the lowing of the cows, to say nothing of the clucking of the hens and the old woman's screaming, one would have thought the end of the world was at hand. The Fox was not a little frightened by all this clatter, but he was not so frightened as the Cock, who saw that only cunning would save his life. "They will catch us in a minute," he said to the Fox, "and, as likely as not, we shall both be killed by a single blow. Why don't you call out and tell them I came with you of my own accord?" "A good idea," thought the Fox, and he opened his mouth to call out to his pursuers, thereby loosening his grip on the Cock's neck. Then, with a squirm and a twist and a flutter of his wings, the wily bird wrenched himself free and flew up to the branches of a tree near by. [Illustration: "DON'T GO AWAY, MY DEAR FRIEND," SAID THE FOX] The Fox cast a look at him and saw that he was out of reach; then he glanced over his shoulder at his pursuers, who were getting perilously near. "It seems to me," he said, grinning with rage, "I should have done better to hold my tongue." "That is true," said the Cock to himself as he smoothed his ruffled feathers. "And I would have been better advised to keep my weather-eye open." [Illustration] [Illustration: THE SOLDIER, THE FOX, AND THE BEAR] THE MOST CUNNING ANIMAL One day the Fox and the Bear began to argue as to which was the most cunning animal. The Bear said that he thought foxes and bears took first place. "You are wrong, my friend," said Reynard. "We are clever, you and I, but there is one animal that is as far above us as we are above the rest of creation." "Oh, indeed," sneered the Bear, "and what is the name of this marvellous creature?" "He is called the man-animal," answered Reynard, "and he goes on two legs instead of four, which is a wonderful thing in itself. Here are some of the cunning things he can do; first, he can swim in the water without getting wet; when he is cold he makes yellow flowers grow out of sticks to warm himself; and he can strike at an enemy a hundred yards away!" "I do not believe you," answered the Bear. "This is a fairy-tale you are telling me. If such a creature as the man-animal really exists, it is very strange that I have never seen him!" "Strange, indeed!" grinned the Fox, "but soon remedied. Would you like to see the man-animal?" "It would be a sight for sore eyes," said the Bear. "Very well," said the Fox, "come along with me." And he led the Bear through the forest until they came to a road leading to a village. "Now, then," said he, "let us lie down in the ditch and watch the road, and we shall see what we shall see." Presently a child from the village came along. "Look! Look!" whispered the Bear. "An animal walking on two legs! Is this the creature we seek?" "No," answered the Fox, "but one of these days it will become a man-animal." Shortly afterwards there came along an old woman, all bent and wrinkled. "Is that one?" asked the Bear. "No," said the Fox again, "but once upon a time that was the mother of one!" At last there came the sound of brisk footsteps on the road, and peeping out between the bushes the Bear saw a tall soldier in a red coat marching towards them. He had a sword by his side and a musket over his shoulder. "This must surely be the man-animal," said the Bear. "Ugh! what an ugly creature! I don't believe he is cunning in the least!" But the Fox made no answer, for at the first sight of the soldier he had fled into the forest. "Well, well," muttered the Bear, "I don't see anything to be afraid of here. Let us have a talk with this wonder!" And hoisting himself clumsily out of the ditch he lumbered along the road to meet the soldier. "Now then, my fine fellow," he growled, "I have heard some wonderful stories about you. Tell me...." But before he could get another word out of his mouth the soldier drew his sword and struck him such a shrewd blow that he cut off his ear. "Wow!" cried the Bear, "what's that for? Tell me...." But then, seeing the gleaming steel flash once again, he turned tail and ran off as fast as he could go. Just as he reached the edge of the wood, he looked backward and saw the soldier raise his gun to his shoulder. There was a flash, a loud report, and the Bear felt a terrific blow against his side. Down he went like a ninepin, but fortunately for him the bullet had merely glanced off his hide, and he was not seriously hurt. Picking himself up, he lost no time in gaining the shelter of the trees, and presently came limping painfully to the place where the Fox was waiting for him. "Well, my friend," said Reynard, "did you see the man-animal? And what did you think of him?" "You were right," answered poor Bruin sadly. "He is certainly the most cunning creature in the world. I went up to speak to him and he tore a rib from his side and cut off my ear. Then I ran away, but before I could reach the trees he picked up a stick and pointed it at me. Then there came thunder and lightning, and a piece of the earth heaved itself up and knocked me spinning! Beyond all doubt the man-animal takes the palm for cunning, but I never want to see him again, for I shall carry the marks of our first meeting to my dying day." And Reynard grinned, and said: "I told you so!" [Illustration] [Illustration] SPONSKEN AND THE GIANT There was once a lad whose face was so badly pitted by the smallpox that everybody called him Sponsken, which means little sponge. From the very day of his birth Sponsken had been a great cause of anxiety to his parents, and as he grew older he became more trouble still, for he was so full of whims and mischief that one never knew where one had him. He would not learn his lessons, nor work at any serious task for ten minutes on end. All he seemed to think of was cutting capers and playing practical jokes on people. At last, in despair, his parents told their trouble to the village sexton, who was a great friend of the family, and often came to smoke his pipe with Sponsken's father in the chimney corner. "Don't worry, my friends," said the sexton. "I've seen young men like your son before, and they are quite easy to manage if one only goes about it the right way. Just leave him to me. What he wants is a good fright, and I'll make it my business to see that he gets it." So far so good. Sponsken's parents were only too glad to fall in with any plan which seemed likely to reform their unruly son, so the sexton went off to make his arrangements. That night he whitened his face with flour, covered himself in a white sheet, and hid behind a tree on a road along which he knew Sponsken would have to pass. It was the dark of the moon, and the place the sexton had chosen was very lonely. For a long time he waited; then, hearing Sponsken coming along whistling a merry tune, he sprang out suddenly from behind his tree and waved his arms in a terrifying manner. "Hallo!" said Sponsken. "Who are you?" The sexton uttered a hollow groan. "What's the matter?" said the boy. "Are you ill? If you can't speak, get out of my way, for I am in a hurry." The sexton groaned again, louder than before, and waved his arms wildly. "Come, come," cried Sponsken, "I can't stay here all night. Tell me what you want at once and let me pass." Then, as the ghostly figure made no answer, he struck it a blow with the stout ash-stick which he carried, and the poor sexton fell, stunned, to the ground. Sponsken stayed long enough to take a glimpse of the ghost's face and to recognize the features of the sexton beneath the flour; then he went on his way homeward, whistling as merrily as before. When he reached home his parents gazed at him uneasily. They were very anxious about the success of their friend's plan, but Sponsken did not look at all like a lad who had been frightened--quite the contrary in fact, for he drew his chair up to the table and set to work upon his supper with an excellent appetite. "A funny thing happened to me to-night," he said carelessly between two bites of an onion. "As I was walking along the lonely road by the cemetery a white figure jumped out at me." "A wh-white figure!" stammered his father. "How terrifying! And what did you do, my son?" "Do?" said Sponsken cheerfully. "Why, I fetched him a crack on the skull with my staff. He went down like a ninepin, and I warrant he won't try to frighten travellers again!" "Base, ungrateful boy!" cried his father, rising to his feet. "It was my dear friend Jan the sexton you struck. All I hope is that you have not killed him." "Well, if I have, it is his own fault," answered Sponsken. "He should not play tricks on me." But his father continued to rage and grumble so long that Sponsken got tired of hearing him at last, and flung off to bed in a sulk. "I'll stand no more of this," he said to himself. "Since my own people do not appreciate me, I'll go out and seek my own fortune in the world, and they may go on as best they can." The next morning, therefore, having packed a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese in a bag, Sponsken set off on his travels, telling nobody where he was going, and taking nothing else with him except a sparrow which he had tamed and kept since it was a fledgling. After walking for a long time he came to a forest, and feeling rather tired he sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree to rest. Now in this forest lived a giant who was the most hideous creature one could possibly imagine. From his forehead jutted a pair of horns; his features were more like those of a beast than a man, and his finger-nails grew long and curved like the claws of a wild animal. The giant considered himself lord of the whole wood, and was very jealous lest anybody should enter his domain. When, therefore, he saw Sponsken he was very angry, and having pulled up a young tree by the roots to serve him as a club, he approached the young man, who was sitting with his eyes closed, and struck him a heavy blow on the shoulder. [Illustration: SPONSKEN, THE GIANT, AND THE PRINCESS] In spite of appearances, Sponsken was not asleep; he was far too wary a person to be caught napping under such conditions. As a matter of fact, he had seen the giant before the giant saw him, and he knew that his only chance of escape was to remain unperturbed and calm. When, therefore, the giant struck him on the shoulder, he opened his eyes sleepily, rubbed the place, and said with a yawn: "A pest on these flies! They bite so hard that a fellow can't sleep for them." "You shall sleep soundly enough in a minute!" muttered the giant, who was enraged at Sponsken's nonchalance. "See how you like this!" And he gave the lad a blow on the other shoulder, harder than before. "There they are again!" cried Sponsken, rubbing the place. "My word! They bite even harder on this side than on the other. It is time I was going!" And he rose from his seat, starting back with surprise as he affected to see the giant for the first time. "So it's you, is it?" he cried. "What do you mean by tickling me when I am trying to sleep? If I were not so kind-hearted I'd break your neck for you!" "Have a care what you say," cried the giant. "Do you know that I have the strength of twenty men and could crush you between my hands like a kitten?" "Pooh!" said Sponsken. "Words are windy things. I have no doubt you could kill a whole regiment with your breath. But words won't go with me, my man; you must give me some proof of your prowess." "Proof!" roared the giant. "See here! I can throw a stone so high into the air that it will not come down for a quarter of an hour." And he was as good as his word, for, picking up a large stone, he flung it with all his strength, and it was more than a quarter of an hour before it fell again at their feet. "Can you match that?" asked the giant with a grin. "Easily," said Sponsken. "I will throw a stone so high that it will not come down at all!" Bending to the ground he picked up a pebble and showed it to the giant, but very cleverly he managed at the last moment to exchange it for the sparrow which he carried in his pocket, and this he was able to do because the giant was rather short-sighted, and, if truth be told, slow-witted as well. [Illustration: HE TOSSED THE BIRD INTO THE AIR] "One, two, three!" cried Sponsken, and he tossed the bird into the air, and of course it flew up and up and never came down at all. "Well, well," said the giant, "I never saw such a thing as that in my life before. You are certainly a wonderful stone-thrower, little man. But can you do this?" And picking up another stone, he squeezed it so hard between his immense fists that he crushed it into a fine powder. "Yes, that is hard to do," said Sponsken, "but I think I can go one better. Any oaf, if he be strong enough, can crush a stone to powder, but it requires skill as well as strength to wring the juice out of one. Watch me!" So saying, Sponsken adroitly slipped out his piece of cheese, and squeezed it until the whey dripped from between his fingers. [Illustration: "THE THREE ANIMALS ARE A BEAR, A UNICORN, AND A WILD BOAR"] "Marvellous!" said the giant. "I confess myself beaten. Let us go into partnership, for there cannot be two others like us in the whole world." "Willingly," answered Sponsken, "but what are we to do?" "Why, as for that," said the giant, "the King of this country has promised his daughter's hand in marriage, and a great treasure besides, to anybody who can destroy three ferocious beasts which are devastating his realm. It seems to me that this is a task we can quite well do together. You, with your quickness and skill, can trap the beasts, and I can kill them with my club. That done, we will divide the spoils." So it was agreed, and without wasting a moment the two took the wood together. Before very long they reached the King's palace, and sent up a message by one of the lords in waiting that they would like to see His Majesty. "And do you mean to tell me," asked the King, when he had heard the giant's tale, "that you can overcome the three fierce animals by the help of this ugly little pock-marked fellow." "Hush! Not so loud, for the love of heaven!" whispered the giant. "My friend is very touchy about his appearance, and if he hears you making such slighting remarks it is very likely he will bring the whole of your palace down about your head!" [Illustration: THE BEAR FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE HOLLOW TRUNK] "You don't say so!" whispered the King in reply, glancing fearfully at the terrible little man. "Well, you are at liberty to try your luck. The three animals are a bear, a unicorn, and a wild boar, and at present they are hidden in the wood close by. There you will find them, but take care of yourselves, for they have already killed scores of my men." "Don't be afraid," answered the giant, "for us this is as easy as playing a game." After having partaken of a good meal the two made their way towards the wood in which the animals were hidden. "We must make a plan," said Sponsken. "Listen to what I propose. You go into the middle of the wood while I remain here on the outskirts; then when you drive the beasts out I will see that they do not escape." So it was arranged. The giant went forward into the wood, while Sponsken remained outside, waiting to see what would happen. He had not to wait long, for presently there was a crashing and a tearing of undergrowth and a great bear came lumbering towards him. Sponsken did not like the look of the creature at all, and decided to put as much space between them as possible. Looking here and there for a refuge, he spied a big oak-tree, and quickly climbed its trunk and ensconced himself among the branches. Unfortunately the bear had already seen him, and, raising himself on his hind legs with a dreadful roar, he rushed to the tree and began to climb. In another moment Sponsken would have been lost, but by good chance the tree happened to be hollow, so without hesitation the lad let himself down into the trunk, and finding at the bottom a small hole which led to the open air, he was just able to wriggle through it and escape. The bear followed him into the hollow trunk, but the hole at the bottom was too small for him to get out by, and as there was hardly room to move inside the trunk, the angry creature had to stay where he was, waking all the echoes in the forest with his growling. The next minute the giant came running out of the forest. "Have you seen the bear?" he cried. "I drove him towards you!" "Don't worry," answered Sponsken coolly; "I've shut him up in the tree there to keep him safe." The giant rushed to the tree and dispatched the bear with one blow of his great club. Then, pulling out the carcass, he shouldered it, and the two went back to the palace, congratulating each other on the excellent beginning of their enterprise. There remained now the unicorn and the wild boar. Next day Sponsken and the giant went to the forest again, and since their first plan had been so successful, it was arranged that they should follow exactly the same course. The giant went into the depths of the wood to find the unicorn and drive him out, while Sponsken remained on the borders to capture the animal when he came. This time the period of waiting was longer, and Sponsken, leaning against the oak-tree, had almost fallen asleep when a clattering of hoofs awakened him, and he sprang aside just in time to escape the unicorn, who, breathing fire from his nostrils, charged down upon him. So great was the impetus of the beast's charge that he could not stop himself, and with a mighty crash he ran full tilt into the tree, driving his horn so far into the trunk that, although he pulled and struggled, he could not wrench himself free. [Illustration: WITH A MIGHTY CRASH HE RAN FULL TILT INTO THE TREE] When the giant came up, Sponsken showed him the animal, which was quickly killed with a single blow of the club. "Didn't I manage that affair well?" asked Sponsken as they went back to the palace. "You are a wonder!" answered the giant, and he really believed what he said. Now only the wild boar remained, and on the following day the two went to the forest to capture him also. Once again the same plan was followed, but this time Sponsken kept his eyes wide open, and when the ferocious beast broke cover he ran as fast as he could in the direction of the royal chapel. The wild boar followed him, and a fearsome creature he looked, I assure you, with his wicked little eyes and his great curved tusks and the hair on his back bristling like the quills of a porcupine. Through the open door of the chapel Sponsken ran, and the boar, snorting with fury, followed him. Then began a fine chase, round and round the aisles, over the pews, and in and out of the vestries. At last Sponsken seized a chair, and dashing it against a window broke several panes, and so made good his escape. While the boar was still standing stupidly staring at the hole through which he had gone out, Sponsken ran round to the door, which he closed and locked. Then, having broken one or two more panes of glass, he sat down quietly by the chapel wall and began to pare his nails. A short time afterwards the giant came rushing up. "Where is the boar? Have you let him get away?" he cried. "Don't get so excited," answered Sponsken. "The boar is safe enough. He's in the chapel there. I had no other place to put him, so I flung him through the window!" "What a wonderful little man you are!" said the giant gleefully, and he ran off to kill the boar with one blow of his club. This done, he hoisted the carcass on to his shoulders and took the road to the palace. Half-way there the weight of the boar began to tell, for it was a massive beast, and the giant was forced to stay and rest. "It is all very well," said he, mopping his streaming brow, "but I think you ought to take a turn with me in carrying this carcass." "Not I," answered Sponsken. "We made an agreement that my work was done when I captured the beast, and I intend to keep to it." [Illustration: SPONSKEN THE PRINCESS THE GIANT] So the giant had to struggle on as best he could for the rest of the way, grumbling at every step, while Sponsken followed, laughing up his sleeve, and exceedingly thankful that he had escaped the task. When they reached the palace the two presented themselves before the King and claimed the promised reward. But now a difficulty arose. It was quite easy to divide the treasure, but which of them was to have the Princess? "I think it should be I," said the giant, "for I killed the three animals." "Not at all," said Sponsken. "The Princess should be given to me, for I captured the beasts." "A lot of good your capturing them would have been if I had not killed them!" said the giant. "How could you have killed them if I had not caught them first?" answered Sponsken. And so the two began to quarrel, and neither would give way, and high words passed between them. Truth to tell, the King was not at all sorry that the dispute had arisen, for he did not very much relish the idea of his daughter marrying either the bestial giant or the pock-marked, ugly little fellow who was his companion. "There is only one way out of the difficulty," said the King at last. "We must let fate decide. Listen to the plan I propose. You shall both of you sleep in the Princess's chamber to-night--the giant in a bed on one side of her couch, and Sponsken on the other. I also will remain in her chamber and watch her carefully. If she spends most of the night with her face turned towards Sponsken, it shall be a sign that she is to marry him; if, on the other hand, she favours the giant, he shall be her husband; but if she sleeps all night with her face towards neither of you, then you must both give her up, and be satisfied with the treasure." So it was agreed, and that night the trial took place. Sponsken, however, did not by any means intend that blind chance should settle so important a matter, and he spent the intervening time in making certain preparations. First of all he went to the palace gardens, from which he gathered certain herbs having an aromatic and beautiful perfume; these he placed in a bag and hid under his clothes. Then from the woods he gathered all the herbs he could find which had a disagreeable smell, such as garlic and stinkwort and poisonous fungus; these also he placed in a bag, and seized an early opportunity, when they came to the Princess's chamber, of hiding the bag under the pillow on which the giant's head was to rest. The Princess well knew the fateful issue which was to be decided in the night, and as she had firmly made up her mind not to marry either the one or the other of her suitors, she determined to remain awake all night and to take care to keep her face turned towards the ceiling. For a time she managed to do so, but before long drowsiness overcame her, and she slept. Presently she turned over on her left side and lay with her face turned towards the giant, who began to chuckle to himself. "Wait a minute," thought Sponsken. "I don't think the Princess will keep that position long!" And sure enough, the horrible stench of the herbs in the bag beneath the giant's pillow penetrated even to her dreams, and the Princess turned over hurriedly on the other side. What a change was there! Instead of a disgusting smell which made her dream of gloomy caverns and noisome things, she found now a delicious perfume that brought pictures of sunlit gardens all glowing with flowers and bright-winged butterflies flitting over them. The Princess gave a little sigh of content, and for the rest of the night she remained with her face turned towards Sponsken, so that the King had no choice but to declare the little man the winner. The Princess, however, refused to abide by the judgment. "I will _not_ marry that vulgar fellow," she cried. "I will die first! Oh, father, if you love me, think of a means of escape!" "Do not be afraid, my child," answered the King. "I will arrange something." And the next day he took the giant aside and proposed to him that he should rid him of Sponsken, promising a rich reward for the service. The giant's greed was aroused, and being very jealous of his companion's success, he was the more ready to fall in with the King's suggestion. Fortunately for himself, Sponsken's quick wits made him suspicious. He guessed that some treachery was afoot, and in order to be prepared for emergencies he took a heavy hammer with him when he retired to bed at night. His suspicions were justified, for towards midnight the door of his room opened and the giant entered on tiptoe, carrying a heavy axe with which he intended to dispatch our friend. No sooner was his foot inside the door, however, than Sponsken jumped out of bed and sprang at him, looking so fierce that the giant, who was a coward at heart, and had besides a healthy respect for his companion's powers, turned and fled in dismay. Then Sponsken lifted his heavy hammer and struck three resounding blows upon the floor. The noise awoke everybody in the palace, and servants, guards, and lords in waiting came flocking to the room to discover the cause. The King came last of all, a little anxious about the success of his fine plot, and when he found Sponsken sitting up in bed, quite unharmed, his face fell. "What is the matter?" he stammered. "Matter?" answered Sponsken. "Nothing very much! Some person wandered into my room, so I just gave three taps with my fingers on the wall. It is lucky for you all that I did not strike the blows with my fist, for had I done so I am afraid there would have been nothing left of your palace but a heap of dust!" At these words everybody turned pale, and the King made haste to protest his undying friendship for his terrible guest. As for the giant, he was in such fear of encountering Sponsken's resentment that he fled, and nobody ever saw him again. Now the poor King did not know what to do, for his daughter still persisted in her refusal to marry Sponsken, and he was torn two ways by love and fear. Just at that time, however, a neighbouring monarch, who was an old enemy of the King's, declared war upon him, and this offered another opportunity for delay. Calling Sponsken before him, the King proposed that he should prove his valour by challenging the enemy king to mortal combat. Sponsken agreed; but his fame had already been noised abroad, and the challenge was refused. "Very well," said the King, who was at the end of his resources. "As my prospective son-in-law you ought to lead my armies into battle. I will place my own charger at your disposal, and I look to you to save my country from defeat." Here was a pretty kettle of fish! Sponsken had never ridden a horse in his life, and he had not the slightest knowledge of warfare. To make matters worse, the steed in question was a notoriously vicious brute who would allow nobody but his own master to mount him. Already he had accounted for several grooms and stablemen, whom he had kicked to death. [Illustration: ALL THE ATTENDANTS FLED AT ONCE] Sponsken commanded that the steed should be led to the borders of the forest and tied by the bridle to a tree. He had not the slightest intention of trying to mount the brute, and his plan was to wait until the attendants had gone away and then to slip off unobserved. Fate, however, was too much for him, for hardly was the horse safely tied up than couriers came spurring along the road to say that the enemy king was advancing at the head of his army, and was at that very moment less than half a mile away. All the attendants fled at once, and Sponsken himself was so overcome by terror that, without thinking what he was doing, he jumped upon the back of the steed, and, forgetting that it was tied to the tree, dug his sharp spurs into its side. The horse plunged and reared, champing at the bit and doing its best to dislodge Sponsken from the saddle, but the lad clung on for dear life. At last, finding all its efforts unavailing, the horse dragged the tree up by the roots and charged forward in a straight line towards the advancing enemy. Almost dislodged from his seat by the sudden jerk, Sponsken stretched out his hand and grasped the branches of the tree, which swung in a terrifying manner at his side, promising every moment to hurl him from the saddle, and the result was that to the enemy army it appeared as though he were charging down upon them at full speed, bearing a tree as a club. Filled with dismay at the terrifying sight, the soldiers of the enemy king fled in all directions and hid themselves in the woods and in the crevices of the rocks. Sponsken rode on for the simple reason that he could do nothing else, right into the enemy's camp, where the steed came to a standstill and our hero was able to jump down from its back. Entering the king's tent, he helped himself to all the documents and articles of value he could find; then, having cut the tree from the bridle, he remounted the horse, which was now quite tame and docile, and rode back to the palace. When the King heard that the enemy was routed he was overjoyed, and he recognized that a man who could perform such a feat single-handed was not to be treated lightly. His daughter, however, was still firm in her refusal to marry Sponsken, and so the King made him an offer of half his kingdom if he would release him from his promise and allow the Princess to go free. Sponsken accepted his terms and married a girl who, although she was not a princess, was nevertheless very pretty. Their wedding was celebrated with great pomp and they lived together very happily for the rest of their lives. [Illustration] [Illustration: THE CAT AND THE SPARROW] WHY CATS ALWAYS WASH AFTER EATING A long time ago a cat caught a sparrow, and licked his lips in anticipation of the delight he would feel in devouring it. After playing with it for a time, as cats will, he was going to eat it, when the sparrow spoke to him. "The Emperor's cat," said the sparrow, "and all his family, never begin a meal without washing themselves first. Everybody knows that such is the custom in polite society." "Really," answered the cat, "well, I will do as the Emperor's cat does!" And he let go the sparrow and began to wash his face. Feeling itself free, the sparrow flew away, and alighted safely on the branch of a tree well out of reach. "It serves me right," muttered the cat, "for being so easily taken in." And ever since that time cats have always washed themselves after their meals. [Illustration: "I'VE JUST BEEN TURNED OUT OF HOUSE"] THE CHORISTERS OF ST. GUDULE The miller of Sandhills had a donkey which had served him well in its time, but was now too old to work. The miller was a careful man, who did not believe in feeding useless mouths, so he decided that he would sell the donkey for the price of its skin. "I do not suppose I shall get very much for the wretched beast," he said, regarding poor Greyskin as he stood with hanging head in his stall, "but I shall save the cost of his corn anyhow, and that is always something." Left alone, Greyskin reflected sadly upon the fate in store for him. "Such is the way of the world," he thought. "When I was young and hearty nothing was too good for me; now I'm old and useless I am to be cast out. But am I so useless after all? True, I can no longer pull a cart to market, but I have a magnificent voice still. There must be a place somewhere for one who can sing as beautifully as I. I'll go to the Cathedral of St. Gudule, in Brussels, and offer myself as a chorister." Greyskin lost no time in acting upon his resolve, but left his stable immediately and set out on the road to Brussels. Passing the Burgomaster's house he saw an old hound sitting disconsolately on the doorstep. "Hallo, friend!" said he. "What is the matter with you? You seem very sad this morning." "The matter is that I am tired of life," answered the dog. "I'm getting old and stiff and I can no longer hunt hares for my master as I used to do. The result is that I am reckoned good for nothing and they grudge me every morsel of food I put into my mouth." "Come, come, cheer up, my friend," said Greyskin. "Never say die! I am in a similar case to yourself and have just left my master for precisely the same reason. My plan is to go to the Cathedral of St. Gudule and offer my services to the master of the choir. If I may say so without conceit, I have a lovely voice--one must make the most of one's gifts, you know--and I ought to be able to command good pay." "Well, if it comes to that," said the dog, "I can sing too. I sang a lovely song to the moon last night, and if you'll believe me, all the people in our street opened their windows to listen. I sang for quite an hour, and I'd have gone on longer if some malicious person, who was no doubt jealous, had not thrown an old boot at my head." "Excellent," said Greyskin. "Come along with me. You shall sing tenor and I'll sing bass. We'll make a famous pair." So the dog joined company with Greyskin, and they went on together towards Brussels. A little farther down the road they saw a cat sitting on the rubbish-heap outside a miserable hovel. The creature was half blind with age, and had a face as long as a fiddle. "Why, what is the matter with you?" asked Greyskin, who had a tender heart. "Matter enough," said the cat. "I've just been turned out of house and home, and all because I took a little piece of bacon from the larder. Upon my honour, it was no bigger than a baby's fist, but they made as much fuss as though it had been a whole gammon. I was beaten, and kicked out to starve. If I could catch mice as I used to do, it would not matter so much, but the mice are too quick for me nowadays. They laugh at me. Nothing remains for me but to die, and I hope it may be soon." [Illustration: "THEY LAUGH AT ME"] "Nonsense," said Greyskin. "You shall live to laugh at all your troubles. Come along with us and sing in the choir at St. Gudule. Your voice is a little too thin for my own taste, but you'll make a very good soprano in a trio. What do you say?" "You give me new hopes," answered the cat. "Of course I'll join you," and so the three went on together. Towards nightfall they arrived at a farmyard, on the gate of which a cock was crowing lustily. "Hallo!" said Greyskin. "What's all this about?" "I am singing my last song on earth," said the cock. "An hour ago I sang a song, although it is not my usual custom to crow in the afternoon, and as I ended I heard the farmer's wife say: 'Hearken to Chanticleer. He's crowing for fine weather to-morrow. I wonder if he'd crow so loudly if he knew that we had guests coming, and that he was going into the pot to make their soup!' She has a horrid laugh, that woman. I have always hated her!" "And do you mean to tell me," said Greyskin, "that you are going to stay here quite contentedly till they come to wring your neck?" "What else can I do?" asked Chanticleer. "Join us, and turn your talents to account. We are all beautiful singers and we are going to Brussels to offer ourselves as choristers at St. Gudule. We were a trio before. With you we shall be a quartet, and that's one better!" Chanticleer was only too glad to find a means of escape, so he willingly joined the party, and they once more took the road. A little while afterwards they came to a thick wood, which was the haunt of a notorious band of robbers. There they decided to rest for the night, so Greyskin and the dog lay down beneath the shelter of a large beech-tree, while the cat climbed on to one of the branches, and Chanticleer perched himself at the very top. From this lofty post he could see over the whole wood, and it was not long before he espied a light twinkling among the trees not far away. [Illustration: "WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?" ASKED CHANTICLEER] [Illustration: "HUSH!" SAID CHANTICLEER] "There must be a house of some sort over there," he said to his companions. "Shall we go and see? We may find something to eat." "Or some straw to lie upon, at any rate," said Greyskin. "This damp ground gives me rheumatics in my old bones." "I was just thinking the same thing," said the dog. "Let us go." So the four choristers, led by the cock, walked in the direction from which the light came, and before long they found themselves in front of a little house, the windows of which were brilliantly lighted. In order to reach to the windows the animals made a tower of their bodies, with Greyskin at the bottom and Chanticleer at the top. Now this house was the abode of a band of robbers, who, at that very moment, were seated before a table laden with all kinds of food. There they sat and feasted, and poor Chanticleer's mouth watered as he watched them. "Is there anybody inside?" asked the dog, who was impatient. "Hush!" said Chanticleer. "Men! They're eating their dinner!" "I wish I was," said the dog. "What are they eating?" "All sorts of things--sausage, and fish...." "Sausage!" said the dog. "Fish!" said the cat. "And ever so many other delicacies," Chanticleer went on. "Look here, friends. Wouldn't it be a fine thing if we could get a share of their meal? I confess that my stomach aches with hunger." "And mine too," said the dog. "I've never been so hungry in my life. But how are we to get the food?" "Let us serenade them, and perhaps they'll throw us something as a reward," said Greyskin. "Music, you know, has charms to soothe the savage breast." This seemed such a good idea that the choristers lost no time in putting it into execution. All four began to sing. The donkey hee-hawed, the dog howled, the cat miaued, and the cock crowed. From the noise they made one would have thought that the heavens were falling. [Illustration: BREAKING THE GLASS TO SMITHEREENS] The effect of this marvellous quartet upon the robbers was instantaneous. Leaping from their seats, they ran from place to place in mortal terror, tumbling over one another, oversetting chairs and adding to the racket by their shrieks and cries. At that moment the cock fell against the window, breaking the glass to smithereens; the donkey gave the frame a push, and all the four precipitated themselves into the room. This was the last straw; the robbers could stand no more; half mad with fear they rushed to the door and fled into the forest. Then our four choristers drew up to the table and set to work upon the food with which it was laden. Their long walk had given them a good appetite, so that there was little left by the time they had finished. Feeling drowsy after their meal, they then settled themselves to sleep. The donkey made himself a bed on a heap of straw in the yard; the dog stretched himself out upon the mat by the house door; the cat lay among the warm cinders on the hearth; and the cock perched upon the roof-top. A few minutes more and they were all fast asleep. Meanwhile the robbers, who had retreated some distance into the forest, waited anxiously for something dreadful to happen. An hour passed by and there was neither sight nor sound to alarm them, so they began to feel a little ashamed of their cowardice. Creeping stealthily nearer to the cottage, they saw that everything was still, and that no light was showing from the windows. At last the robber chief sent his lieutenant to spy out the land, and this man, returning to the cottage without mishap, found his way into the kitchen and proceeded to light a candle. He had no matches, but he saw two sparks of fire among the cinders on the hearth, so he went forward to get a light from them. Now this light came from the cat's eyes, and as soon as puss felt the robber touch her, she sprang up, snarling and spitting, and scratched his face. With a scream of terror, he dropped his candle and rushed for the door, and as he passed the dog bit him in the leg. By this time the noise had awakened Greyskin, who got upon his feet just as the man ran by, and helped him forward with a mighty kick, which sent him flying out into the roadway. Seeing this, the cock on the housetop spread his wings and crowed in triumph, "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" I wish you could have seen the way that robber ran! He covered the ground so quickly that he seemed like a flying shadow, and I am perfectly certain that not even a hare could have overtaken him. At last, panting for breath, he rejoined his comrades in the forest, who were eagerly awaiting his return. "Well," cried the chief, "is the way clear? Can we go back?" "Not on any account," cried the robber. "There's a horrible witch in the kitchen. Directly I entered she sprang at me and tore my face with her long claws, calling out at the same time to her creatures to come and devour me. As I ran through the door one of them buried his fangs in my leg, and a little farther on, in the yard, a great black monster struck at me with an enormous club, giving me a blow that nearly broke my back-bone. On the roof a little demon with wings and eyes that shone like coals of fire cried, 'Stop him! Eat him! Stop him! Eat him!' You may guess that I did not wait for more. It is a miracle that I have escaped with my life!" When they heard this terrible story the robbers lost no time in decamping, and such was their terror that they deserted the forest altogether and went away to another part of the country. The result was that our four friends were and trouble for others deserves to succeed. CHAPTER V: Blacky Calls His Friends When Blacky cries “Caw, caw, caw, caw!” As if he'd dislocate his jaw, His relatives all hasten where He waits them with a crafty air. They know that there is mischief afoot, and the Crow family is always ready for mischief. So on this particular morning when they heard Blacky cawing at the top of his lungs from the tallest pine-tree in the Green Forest, they hastened over there as fast as they could fly, calling to each other excitedly and sure that they were going to have a good time of some kind. Blacky chuckled as he saw them coming. “Come on! Come on! Caw, caw, caw! Hurry up and flap your wings faster. I know where Hooty the Owl is, and we'll have no end of fun with him,” he cried. “Caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw!” shouted all his relatives in great glee. “Where is he? Lead us to him. We'll drive him out of the Green Forest!” So Blacky led the way over to the most lonesome corner of the Green Forest, straight to the tree in which Hooty the Owl was comfortably sleeping. Blacky had taken pains to slip over early that morning and make sure just where he was. He had discovered Hooty fast asleep, and he knew that he would remain right where he was until dark. You know Hooty's eyes are not meant for much use in bright light, and the brighter the light, the more uncomfortable his eyes feel. Blacky knows this, too, and he had chosen the very brightest part of the morning to call his relatives over to torment poor Hooty. Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun was shining his very brightest, and the white snow on the ground made it seem brighter still. Even Blacky had to blink, and he knew that poor Hooty would find it harder still. But one thing Blacky was very careful not to even hint of, and that was that Mrs. Hooty was right close at hand. Mrs. Hooty is bigger and even more fierce than Hooty, and Blacky didn't want to frighten any of the more timid of his relatives. What he hoped down deep in his crafty heart was that when they got to teasing and tormenting Hooty and making the great racket which he knew they would, Mrs. Hooty would lose her temper and fly over to join Hooty in trying to drive away the black tormentors. Then Blacky would slip over to the nest which she had left unguarded and steal one and perhaps both of the eggs he knew were there. When they reached the tree where Hooty was, he was blinking his great yellow eyes and had fluffed out all his feathers, which is a way he has when he is angry, to make himself look twice as big as he really is. Of course, he had heard the noisy crew coming, and he knew well enough what to expect. As soon as they saw him, they began to scream as loud as ever they could and to call him all manner of names. The boldest of them would dart at him as if to pull out a mouthful of feathers, but took the greatest care not to get too near. You see, the way Hooty hissed and snapped his great bill was very threatening, and they knew that if once he got hold of one of them with those big cruel claws of his, that would be the end. So they were content to simply scold and scream at him and fly around him, just out of reach, and make him generally uncomfortable, and they were so busy doing this that no one noticed that Blacky was not joining in the fun, and no one paid any attention to the old tumble-down nest of Redtail the Hawk only a few trees distant. So far Blacky's plans were working out just as he had hoped. CHAPTER VI: Hooty The Owl Doesn't Stay Still Now what's the good of being smart When others do not do their part? If Blacky the Crow didn't say this to himself, he thought it. He knew that he had made a very cunning plan to get the eggs of Hooty the Owl, a plan so shrewd and cunning that no one else in the Green Forest or on the Green Meadows would have thought of it. There was only one weakness in it, and that was that it depended for success on having Hooty the Owl do as he usually did when tormented by a crowd of noisy Crows,--stay where he was until they got tired and flew away. Now Blacky sometimes makes a mistake that smart people are very apt to make; he thinks that because he is so smart, other people are stupid. That is where he proves that smart as he is, he isn't as smart as he thinks he is. He always thought of Hooty the Owl as stupid. That is, he always thought of him that way in daytime. At night, when he was waked out of a sound sleep by the fierce hunting cry of Hooty, he wasn't so sure about Hooty being stupid, and he always took care to sit perfectly still in the darkness, lest Hooty's great ears should hear him and Hooty's great eyes, made for seeing in the dark, should find him. No, in the night Blacky was not at all sure that Hooty was stupid. But in the daytime he was sure. You see, he quite forgot the fact that the brightness of day is to Hooty what the blackness of night is to him. So, because Hooty would simply sit still and hiss and snap his bill, instead of trying to catch his tormentors or flying away, Blacky called him stupid. He felt sure that Hooty would stay right where he was now, and he hoped that Mrs. Hooty would lose her temper and leave the nest where she was sitting on those two eggs and join Hooty to help him try to drive away that noisy crew. But Hooty isn't stupid. Not a bit of it. The minute he found out that Blacky and his friends had discovered him, he thought of Mrs. Hooty and the two precious eggs in the old nest of Redtail the Hawk close by. “Mrs. Hooty mustn't be disturbed,” thought he. “That will never do at all. I must lead these black rascals away where they won't discover Mrs. Hooty. I certainly must.” So he spread his broad wings and blundered away among the trees a little way. He didn't fly far because the instant he started to fly that whole noisy crew with the exception of Blacky were after him. Because he couldn't use his claws or bill while flying, they grew bold enough to pull a few feathers out of his back. So he flew only a little way to a thick hemlock-tree, where it wasn't easy for the Crows to get at him, and where the light didn't hurt his eyes so much. There he rested a few minutes and then did the same thing over again. He meant to lead those bothersome Crows into the darkest part of the Green Forest and there--well, he could see better there, and it might be that one of them would be careless enough to come within reach. No, Hooty wasn't stupid. Certainly not. Blacky awoke to that fact as he sat in the top of a tall pine-tree silently watching. He could see Mrs. Hooty on the nest, and as the noise of Hooty's tormentors sounded from farther and farther away, she settled herself more comfortably and closed her eyes. Blacky could imagine that she was smiling to herself. It was clear that she had no intention of going to help Hooty. His splendid plan had failed just because stupid Hooty, who wasn't stupid at all, had flown away when he ought to have sat still. It was very provoking. CHAPTER VII: Blacky Tries Another Plan When one plan fails, just try another; Declare you'll win some way or other. People who succeed are those who do not give up because they fail the first time they try. They are the ones who, as soon as one plan fails, get busy right away and think of another plan and try that. If the thing they are trying to do is a good thing, sooner or later they succeed. If they are trying to do a wrong thing, very likely all their plans fail, as they should. Now Blacky the Crow knows all about the value of trying and trying. He isn't easily discouraged. Sometimes it is a pity that he isn't, because he plans so much mischief. But the fact remains that he isn't, and he tries and tries until he cannot think of another plan and just has to give up. When he invited all his relatives to join him in tormenting Hooty the Owl, he thought he had a plan that just couldn't fail. He felt sure that Mrs. Hooty would leave her nest and help Hooty try to drive away his tormentors. But Mrs. Hooty didn't do anything of the kind, because Hooty was smart enough and thoughtful enough to lead his tormentors away from the nest into the darkest part of the Green Forest where their noise wouldn't bother Mrs. Hooty. So she just settled herself more comfortably than ever on those eggs which Blacky had hoped she would give him a chance to steal, and his fine plan was quite upset. Not one of his relatives had noticed that nest. They had been too busy teasing Hooty. This was just as Blacky had hoped. He didn't want them to know about that nest because he was selfish and wanted to get those eggs just for himself alone. But now he knew that the only way he could get Mrs. Hooty off of them would be by teasing her so that she would lose her temper and try to catch some of her tormentors. If she did that, there would be a chance that he might slip in and get at least one of those eggs. He would try it. For a few minutes he listened to the noise of his relatives growing fainter and fainter, as Hooty led them farther and farther into the Green Forest. Then he opened his mouth. “Caw, caw, caw, caw!” he screamed. “Caw, caw, caw, caw! Come back, everybody! Here is Mrs. Hooty on her nest! Caw, caw, caw, caw!” Now as soon as they heard that, all Blacky's relatives stopped chasing and tormenting Hooty and started back as fast as they could fly. They didn't like the dark part of the Green Forest into which Hooty was leading them. Besides, they wanted to see that nest. So back they came, cawing at the top of their lungs, for they were very much excited. Some of them never had seen a nest of Hooty's. And anyway, it would be just as much fun to tease Mrs. Hooty as it was to tease Hooty. “Where is the nest?” they screamed, as they came back to where Blacky was cawing and pretending to be very much excited. “Why,” exclaimed one, “that is the old nest of Redtail the Hawk. I know all about that nest.” And he looked at Blacky as if he thought Blacky was playing a joke on them. “It was Redtail's, but it is Hooty's now. If you don't believe me, just look in it,” retorted Blacky. At once they all began to fly over the top of the tree where they could look down into the nest and there, sure enough, was Mrs. Hooty, her great, round, yellow eyes glaring up at them angrily. Such a racket! Right away Hooty was forgotten, and the whole crowd at once began to torment Mrs. Hooty. Only Blacky sat watchful and silent, waiting for Mrs. Hooty to lose her temper and try to catch one of her tormentors. He had hope, a great hope, that he would get one of those eggs. CHAPTER VIII: Hooty Comes To Mrs. Hooty's Aid No one can live just for self alone. A lot of people think they can, but they are very much mistaken. They are making one of the greatest mistakes in the world. Every teeny, weeny act, no matter what it is, affects somebody else. That is one of Old Mother Nature's great laws. And it is just as true among the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows as with boys and girls and grown people. It is Old Mother Nature's way of making each of us responsible for the good of all and of teaching us that always we should help each other. As you know, when Blacky the Crow called all his relatives over to the nest where Mrs. Hooty was sitting on her eggs, they at once stopped tormenting Hooty and left him alone in a thick hemlock-tree in the darkest part of the Green Forest. Of course Hooty was very, very glad to be left in peace, and he might have spent the rest of the day there sleeping in comfort. But he didn't. No, Sir, he didn't. At first he gave a great sigh of relief and settled himself as if he meant to stay. He listened to the voices of those noisy Crows growing fainter and fainter and was glad. But it was only for a few minutes. Presently those voices stopped growing fainter. They grew more excited-sounding than ever, and they came right from one place. Hooty knew then that his tormentors had found the nest where Mrs. Hooty was, and that they were tormenting her just as they had tormented him. He snapped his bill angrily and then more angrily. “I guess Mrs. Hooty is quite able to take care of herself,” he grumbled, “but she ought not to be disturbed while she is sitting on those eggs. I hate to go back there in that bright sunshine. It hurts my eyes, and I don't like it, but I guess I'll have to go back there. Mrs. Hooty needs my help. I'd rather stay here, but--” He didn't finish. Instead, he spread his broad wings and flew back towards the nest and Mrs. Hooty. His great wings made no noise, for they are made so that he can fly without making a sound. “If I once get hold of one of those Crows!” he muttered to himself. “If I once get hold of one of those Crows, I'll--” He didn't say what he would do, but if you had been near enough to hear the snap of his bill, you could have guessed the rest. All this time the Crows were having what they called fun with Mrs. Hooty. Nothing is true fun which makes others uncomfortable, but somehow a great many people seem to forget this. So, while Blacky sat watching, his relatives made a tremendous racket around Mrs. Hooty, and the more angry she grew, the more they screamed and called her names and darted down almost in her face, as they pretended that they were going to fight her. They were so busy doing this, and Blacky was so busy watching them, hoping that Mrs. Hooty would leave her nest and give him a chance to steal the eggs he knew were under her, that no one gave Hooty a thought. All of a sudden he was there, right in the tree close to the nest! No one had heard a sound, but there he was, and in the claws of one foot he held the tail feathers of one of Blacky's relatives. It was lucky, very lucky indeed for that one that the sun was in Hooty's eyes and so he had missed his aim. Otherwise there would have been one less Crow. Now it is one thing to tease one lone Owl and quite another to tease two together. Besides, there were those black tail feathers floating down to the snow-covered ground. Quite suddenly those Crows decided that they had had fun enough for one day, and in spite of all Blacky could do to stop them, away they flew, cawing loudly and talking it all over noisily. Blacky was the last to go, and his heart was sorrowful. However could he get those eggs? CHAPTER IX: Blacky Thinks Of Farmer Brown's Boy “Such luck!” grumbled Blacky, as he flew over to his favorite tree to do a little thinking. “Such luck! Now all my neighbors know about the nest of Hooty the Owl, and sooner or later one of them will find out that there are eggs in it. There is one thing about it, though, and that is that if I can't get them, nobody can. That is to say, none of my relatives can. I've tried every way I can think of, and those eggs are still there. My, my, my, how I would like one of them right now!” Then Blacky the Crow did a thing which disappointed scamps often do,--began to blame the ones he was trying to wrong because his plans had failed. To have heard him talking to himself, you would have supposed that those eggs really belonged to him and that Hooty and Mrs. Hooty had cheated him out of them. Yes, Sir, that is what you would have thought if you could have heard him muttering to himself there in the tree-top. In his disappointment over not getting those eggs, he was so sorry for himself that he actually did feel that he was the one wronged,--that Hooty and Mrs. Hooty should have let him have those eggs. Of course, that was absolute foolishness, but he made himself believe it just the same. At least, he pretended to believe it. And the more he pretended, the angrier he grew. This is often the way with people who try to wrong others. They grow angry with the ones they have tried to wrong. When at last Blacky had to confess to himself that he could think of no other way to get those eggs, he began to wonder if there was some way to make trouble for Hooty and Mrs. Hooty. It was right then that he thought of Farmer Brown's boy. Blacky's eyes snapped. He remembered how, once upon a time, Farmer Brown's boy had delighted to rob nests. Blacky had seen him take the eggs from the nests of Blacky's own relatives and from many other feathered people. What he did with the eggs, Blacky had no idea. Just now he didn't care. If Farmer Brown's boy would just happen to find Hooty's nest, he would be sure to take those eggs, and then he, Blacky, would feel better. He would feel that he was even with Hooty. Right away he began to try to think of some way to bring Farmer Brown's boy over to the lonesome corner of the Green Forest where Hooty's nest was. If he could once get him there, he felt sure that Farmer Brown's boy would see the nest and climb up to it, and then of course he would take the eggs. If he couldn't have those eggs himself, the next best thing would be to see some one else get them. Dear me, dear me, such dreadful thoughts! I am afraid that Blacky's heart was as black as his coat. And the worst of it was, he seemed to get a lot of pleasure in his wicked plans. Now right down in his heart he knew that they were wicked plans, but he tried to make excuses to himself. “Hooty the Owl is a robber,” said he. “Everybody is afraid of him. He lives on other people, and so far as I know he does no good in the world. He is big and fierce, and no one loves him. The Green Forest would be better off without him. If those eggs hatch, there will be little Owls to be fed, and they will grow up into big fierce Owls, like their father and mother. So if I show Farmer Brown's boy that nest and he takes those eggs, I will be doing a kindness to my neighbors.” So Blacky talked to himself and tried to hush the still, small voice down inside that tried to tell him that what he was planning to do was really a dreadful thing. And all the time he watched for Farmer Brown's boy. CHAPTER X: Farmer Brown's Boy And Hooty Farmer Brown's boy had taken it into his head to visit the Green Forest. It was partly because he hadn't anything else to do, and it was partly because now that it was very near the end of winter he wanted to see how things were there and if there were any signs of the coming of spring. Blacky the Crow saw him coming, and Blacky chuckled to himself. He had watched every day for a week for just this thing. Now he would tell Farmer Brown's boy about that nest of Hooty the Owl. He flew over to the lonesome corner of the Green Forest where Hooty and Mrs. Hooty had made their home and at once began to caw at the top of his voice and pretend that he was terribly excited over something. “Caw, caw, caw, caw, caw!” shouted Blacky. At once all his relatives within hearing hurried over to join him. They knew that he was tormenting Hooty, and they wanted to join in the fun. It wasn't long before there was a great racket going on over in that lonesome corner of the Green Forest. Of course Farmer Brown's boy heard it. He stopped and listened. “Now I wonder what Blacky and his friends have found this time,” said he. “Whenever they make a fuss like that, there is usually something to see there. I believe I'll so over and have a look.” So he turned in the direction of the lonesome corner of the Green Forest, and as he drew near, he moved very carefully, so as to see all that he could without frightening the Crows. He knew that as soon as they saw him, they would fly away, and that might alarm the one they were tormenting, for he knew enough of Crow ways to know that when they were making such a noise as they were now making, they were plaguing some one. Blacky was the first to see him because he was watching for him. But he didn't say anything until Farmer Brown's boy was so near that he couldn't help but see that nest and Hooty himself, sitting up very straight and snapping his bill angrily at his tormentors. Then Blacky gave the alarm, and at once all the Crows rose in the air and headed for the Green Meadows, cawing at the top of their lungs. Blacky went with them a little way. The first chance he got he dropped out of the flock and silently flew back to a place where he could see all that might happen at the nest of Hooty the Owl. When Farmer Brown's boy first caught sight of the nest and saw the Crows darting down toward it and acting so excited, he was puzzled. “That's an old nest of Red-tail the Hawk,” thought he. “I found that last spring. Now what can there be there to excite those Crows so?” Then he caught sight of Hooty the Owl. “Ha, so that's it!” he exclaimed. “Those scamps have discovered Hooty and have been having no end of fun tormenting him. I wonder what he's doing there.” He no longer tried to keep out of sight, but walked right up to the foot of the tree, all the time looking up. Hooty saw him, but instead of flying away, he snapped his bill just as he had at the Crows and hissed. “That's funny,” thought Farmer Brown's boy. “If I didn't know that to be the old nest of Redtail the Hawk, and if it weren't still the tail-end of winter, I would think that was Hooty's nest.” He walked in a circle around the tree, looking up. Suddenly he gave a little start. Was that a tail sticking over the edge of the nest? He found a stick and threw it up. It struck the bottom of the nest, and out flew a great bird. It was Mrs. Hooty! Blacky the Crow chuckled. CHAPTER XI: Farmer Brown's Boy Is Tempted When you're tempted to do wrong Is the time to prove you're strong. Shut your eyes and clench each fist; It will help you to resist. When a bird is found sitting on a nest, it is a pretty sure sign that that nest holds something worth while. It is a sign that that bird has set up housekeeping. So when Farmer Brown's boy discovered Mrs. Hooty sitting so close on the old nest of Redtail the Hawk, in the most lonesome corner of the Green Forest, he knew what it meant. Perhaps I should say that he knew what it ought to mean. It ought to mean that there were eggs in that nest. But it was hard for Farmer Brown's boy to believe that. Why, spring had not come yet! There was still snow, and the Smiling Pool was still covered with ice. Who ever heard of birds nesting at this time of year? Certainly not Farmer Brown's boy. And yet Hooty the Owl and Mrs. Hooty were acting for all the world as feathered folks do act when they have eggs and are afraid that something is going to happen to them. It was very puzzling. “That nest was built by Red-tail the Hawk, and it hasn't even been repaired,” muttered Farmer Brown's boy, as he stared up at it. “If Hooty and his wife have taken it for their home, they are mighty poor housekeepers. And if Mrs. Hooty has laid eggs this time of year, she must be crazy. I suppose the way to find out is to climb up there. It seems foolish, but I'm going to do it. Those Owls certainly act as if they are mighty anxious about something, and I'm going to find out what it is.” He looked at Hooty and Mrs. Hooty, at their hooked bills and great claws, and decided that he would take a stout stick along with him. He had no desire to feel these great claws. When he had found a stick to suit him, he began to climb the tree. Hooty and Mrs. Hooty snapped their bills and hissed fiercely. They drew nearer. Farmer Brown's boy kept a watchful eye on them. They looked so big and fierce that he was almost tempted to give up and leave them in peace. But he just had to find out if there was anything in that nest, so he kept on. As he drew near it, Mrs. Hooty swooped very near to him, and the snap of her bill made an ugly sound. He held his stick ready to strike and kept on. The nest was simply a great platform of sticks. When Farmer Brown's boy reached it, he found that he could not get where he could look into it, so he reached over and felt inside. Almost at once his fingers touched something that made him tingle all over. It was an egg, a great big egg! There was no doubt about it. It was just as hard for him to believe as it had been for Blacky the Crow to believe, when he first saw those eggs. Farmer Brown's boy's fingers closed over that egg and took it out of the nest. Mrs. Hooty swooped very close, and Farmer Brown's boy nearly dropped the egg as he struck at her with his stick. Then Mrs. Hooty and Hooty seemed to lose courage and withdrew to a tree near by, where they snapped their bills and hissed. Then Farmer Brown's boy looked at the prize in his hand. It was a big, dirty-white egg. His eyes shone. What a splendid prize to add to his collection of birds' eggs! It was the first egg of the Great Horned Owl, the largest of all Owls, that he ever had seen. Once more he felt in the nest and found there was another egg there. “I'll take both of them,” said he. “It's the first nest of Hooty's that I've ever found, and perhaps I'll never find another. Gee, I'm glad I came over here to find out what those Crows were making such a fuss about. I wonder if I can get these down without breaking them.” Just at that very minute he remembered something. He remembered that he had stopped collecting eggs. He remembered that he had resolved never to take another bird's egg. “But this is different,” whispered the tempter. “This isn't like taking the eggs of the little song birds.” CHAPTER XII: A Tree-Top Battle As black is black and white is white, So wrong is wrong and right is right. There isn't any half way about it. A thing is wrong or it is right, and that is all there is to it. But most people have hard work to see this when they want very much to do a thing that the still small voice way down inside tells them isn't right. They try to compromise. To compromise is to do neither one thing nor the other but a little of both. But you can't do that with right and wrong. It is a queer thing, but a half right never is as good as a whole right, while a half wrong often, very often, is as bad as a whole wrong. Farmer Brown's boy, up in the tree by the nest of Hooty the Owl in the lonesome corner of the Green Forest, was fighting a battle. No, he wasn't fighting with Hooty or Mrs. Hooty. He was fighting a battle right inside himself. It was a battle between right and wrong. Once upon a time he had taken great delight in collecting the eggs of birds, in trying to see how many kinds he could get. Then as he had come to know the little forest and meadow people better, he had seen that taking the eggs of birds is very, very wrong, and he had stopped stealing them. He bad declared that never again would he steal an egg from a bird. But never before had he found a nest of Hooty the Owl. Those two big eggs would add ever so much to his collection. “Take 'em,” said a little voice inside. “Hooty is a robber. You will be doing a kindness to the other birds by taking them.” “Don't do it,” said another little voice. “Hooty may be a robber, but he has a place in the Green Forest, or Old Mother Nature never would have put him here. It is just as much stealing to take his eggs as to take the eggs of any other bird. He has just as much right to them as Jenny Wren has to hers.” “Take one and leave one,” said the first voice. “That will be just as much stealing as if you took both,” said the second voice. “Besides, you will be breaking your own word. You said that you never would take another egg.” “I didn't promise anybody but myself,” declared Farmer Brown's boy right out loud. At the sound of his voice, Hooty and Mrs. Hooty, sitting in the next tree, snapped their bills and hissed louder than ever. “A promise to yourself ought to be just as good as a promise to any one else. I don't wonder Hooty hisses at you,” said the good little voice. “Think how fine those eggs will look in your collection and how proud you will be to show them to the other fellows who never have found a nest of Hooty's,” said the first little voice. “And think how mean and small and cheap you'll feel every time you look at them,” added the good little voice. “You'll get a lot more fun if you leave them to hatch out and then watch the little Owls grow up and learn all about their ways. Just think what a stout, brave fellow Hooty is to start housekeeping at this time of year, and how wonderful it is that Mrs. Hooty can keep these eggs warm and when they have hatched take care of the baby Owls before others have even begun to build their nests. Besides, wrong is wrong and right is right, always.” Slowly Farmer Brown's boy reached over the edge of the nest and put back the egg. Then he began to climb down the tree. When he reached the ground he went off a little way and watched. Almost at once Mrs. Hooty flew to the nest and settled down on the eggs, while Hooty mounted guard close by. “I'm glad I didn't take 'em,” said Farmer Brown's boy. “Yes, Sir, I'm glad I didn't take 'em.” As he turned back toward home, he saw Blacky the Crow flying over the Green Forest, and little did he guess how he had upset Blacky's plans. CHAPTER XIII: Blacky Has A Change Of Heart Blacky The Crow isn't all black. No, indeed. His coat is black, and sometimes it seems as if his heart is all black, but this isn't so. It certainly seemed as if his heart was all black when he tried so hard to make trouble for Hooty the Owl. It would seem as if only a black heart could have urged him to try so hard to steal the eggs of Hooty and Mrs. Hooty, but this wasn't really so. You see, it didn't seem at all wrong to try to get those eggs. Blacky was hungry, and those eggs would have given him a good meal. He knew that Hooty wouldn't hesitate to catch him and eat him if he had the chance, and so it seemed to him perfectly right and fair to steal Hooty's eggs if he was smart enough to do so. And most of the other little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows would have felt the same way about it. You see, it is one of the laws of Old Mother Nature that each one must learn to look out for himself. But when Blacky showed that nest of Hooty's to Farmer Brown's boy with the hope that Farmer Brown's boy would steal those eggs, there was blackness in his heart. He was doing something then which was pure meanness. He was just trying to make trouble for Hooty, to get even because Hooty had been too smart for him. He had sat in the top of a tall pine-tree where he could see all that happened, and he had chuckled wickedly as he had seen Farmer Brown's boy climb to Hooty's nest and take out an egg. He felt sure that he would take both eggs. He hoped so, anyway. When he saw Farmer Brown's boy put the eggs back and climb down the tree without any, he had to blink his eyes to make sure that he saw straight. He just couldn't believe what he saw. At first he was dreadfully disappointed and angry. It looked very much as if he weren't going to get even with Hooty after all. He flew over to his favorite tree to think things over. Now sometimes it is a good thing to sit by oneself and think things over. It gives the little small voice deep down inside a chance to be heard. It was just that way with Blacky now. The longer he thought, the meaner his action in calling Farmer Brown's boy looked. It was one thing to try to steal those eggs himself, but it was quite another matter to try to have them stolen by some one against whom Hooty had no protection whatever. “If it had been any one but Hooty, you would have done your best to have kept Farmer Brown's boy away,” said the little voice inside. Blacky hung his head. He knew that it was true. More than once, in fact many times, he had warned other feathered folks when Farmer Brown's boy had been hunting for their nests, and had helped to lead him away. At last Blacky threw up his head and chuckled, and this time his chuckle was good to hear. “I'm glad that Farmer Brown's boy didn't take those eggs,” said he right out loud. “Yes, sir, I'm glad. I'll never do such a thing as that again. I'm ashamed of what I did; yet I'm glad I did it. I'm glad because I've learned some things. I've learned that Farmer Brown's boy isn't as much to be feared as he used to be. I've learned that Hooty isn't as stupid as I thought he was. I've learned that while it may be all right for us people of the Green Forest to try to outwit each other we ought to protect each other against common dangers. And I've learned something I didn't know before, and that is that Hooty the Owl is the very first of us to set up housekeeping. Now I think I'll go hunt for an honest meal.” And he did. CHAPTER XIV: Blacky Makes A Call Judge no one by his style of dress; Your ignorance you thus confess. --Blacky the Crow. “Caw, caw, caw, caw.” There was no need of looking to see who that was. Peter Rabbit knew without looking. Mrs. Quack knew without looking. Just the same, both looked up. Just alighting in the top of a tall tree was Blacky the Crow. “Caw, caw, caw, caw,” he repeated, looking down at Peter and Mrs. Quack and Mr. Quack and the six young Quacks. “I hope I am not interrupting any secret gossip.” “Not at all,” Peter hastened to say. “Mrs. Quack was just telling me of the troubles and clangers in bringing up a young family in the Far North. How did you know the Quacks had arrived?” Blacky chuckled hoarsely. “I didn't,” said he. “I simply thought there might be something going on I didn't know about over here in the pond of Paddy the Beaver, so I came over to find out. Mr. Quack, you and Mrs. Quack are looking very fine this fall. And those handsome young Quacks, you don't mean to tell me that they are your children!” Mrs. Quack nodded proudly. “They are,” said she. “You don't say so!” exclaimed Blacky, as if he were very much surprised, when all the time he wasn't surprised at all. “They are a credit to their parents. Yes, indeed, they are a credit to their parents. Never have I seen finer young Ducks in all my life. How glad the hunters with terrible guns will be to see them.” Mrs. Quack shivered at that, and Blacky saw it. He chuckled softly. You know he dearly loves to make others uncomfortable. “I saw three hunters over on the edge of the Big River early this very morning,” said he. Mrs. Quack looked more anxious than ever. Blacky's sharp eyes noted this. “That is why I came over here,” he added kindly. “I wanted to give you warning.” “But you didn't know the Quacks were here!” spoke up Peter. “True enough, Peter. True enough,” replied Blacky, his eyes twinkling. “But I thought they might be. I had heard a rumor that those who go south are traveling earlier than usual this fall, so I knew I might find Mr. and Mrs. Quack over here any time now. Is it true, Mrs. Quack, that we are going to have a long, hard, cold winter?” “That is what they say up in the Far North,” replied Mrs. Quack. “And it is true that Jack Frost had started down earlier than usual. That is how it happens we are here now. But about those hunters over by the Big River, do you suppose they will come over here?” There was an anxious note in Mrs. Quack's voice. “No,” replied Blacky promptly. “Farmer Brown's boy won't let them. I know. I've been watching him and he has been watching those hunters. As long as you stay here, you will be safe. What a great world this would be if all those two-legged creatures were like Farmer Brown's boy.” “Wouldn't it!” cried Peter. Then he added, “I wish they were.” “You don't wish it half as much as I do,” declared Mrs. Quack. “Yet I can remember when he used to hunt with a terrible gun and was as bad as the worst of them,” said Blacky. “What changed him?” asked Mrs. Quack, looking interested. “Just getting really acquainted with some of the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows,” replied Blacky. “He found them ready to meet him more than halfway in friendship and that some of them really are his best friends.” “And now he is their best friend,” spoke up Peter. Blacky nodded. “Right, Peter,” said he. “That is why the Quacks are safe here and will be as long as they stay.” CHAPTER XV: Blacky Does A Little Looking About Do not take the word of others That things are or are not so When there is a chance that you may Find out for yourself and know. --Blacky the Crow. Blacky the Crow is a shrewd fellow. He is one of the smartest and shrewdest of all the little people in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows. Everybody knows it. And because of this, all his neighbors have a great deal of respect for him, despite his mischievous ways. Of course, Blacky had noticed that Johnny Chuck had dug his house deeper than usual and had stuffed himself until he was fatter than ever before. He had noticed that Jerry Muskrat was making the walls of his house thicker than in other years, and that Paddy the Beaver was doing the same thing to his house. You know there is very little that escapes the sharp eyes of Blacky the Crow. He had guessed what these things meant. “They think we are going to have a long, hard, cold winter,” muttered Blacky to himself. “Perhaps they know, but I want to see some signs of it for myself. They may be only guessing. Anybody can do that, and one guess is as good as another.” Then he found Mr. and Mrs. Quack, the Mallard Ducks, and their children in the pond of Paddy the Beaver and remembered that they never had come down from their home in the Far North as early in the fall as this. Mrs. Quack explained that Jack Frost had already started south, and so they had started earlier to keep well ahead of him. “Looks as if there may be something in this idea of a long, hard, cold winter,” thought Blacky, “but perhaps the Quacks are only guessing, too. I wouldn't take their word for it any more than I would the word of Johnny Chuck or Jerry Muskrat or Paddy the Beaver. I'll look about a little.” So after warning the Quacks to remain in the pond of Paddy the Beaver if they would be safe, Blacky bade them good-by and flew away. He headed straight for the Green Meadows and Farmer Brown's cornfield. A little of that yellow corn would make a good breakfast. When he reached the cornfield, Blacky perched on top of a shock of corn, for it already had been cut and put in shocks in readiness to be carted up to Farmer Brown's barn. For a few minutes he sat there silent and motionless, but all the time his sharp eyes were making sure that no enemy was hiding behind one of those brown shocks. When he was quite certain that things were as safe as they seemed, he picked out a plump ear of corn and began to tear open the husks, so as to get at the yellow grains. “Seems to me these husks are unusually thick,” muttered Blacky, as he tore at them with his stout bill. “Don't remember ever having seen them as thick as these. Wonder if it just happens to be so on this ear.” Then, as a sudden thought popped into his black head, he left that ear and went to another. The husks of this were as thick as those on the first. He flew to another shock and found the husks there just the same. He tried a third shock with the same result. “Huh, they are all alike,” said he. Then he looked thoughtful and for a few minutes sat perfectly still like a black statue. “They are right,” said he at last. “Yes, Sir, they are right.” Of course he meant Johnny Chuck and Jerry Muskrat and Paddy the Beaver and the Quacks. “I don't know how they know it, but they are right; we are going to have a long, hard, cold winter. I know it myself now. I've found a sign. Old Mother Nature has wrapped this corn in extra thick husks, and of course she has done it to protect it. She doesn't do things without a reason. We are going to have a cold winter, or my name isn't Blacky the Crow.” CHAPTER XVI: Blacky Finds Other Signs A single fact may fail to prove you either right or wrong; Confirm it with another and your proof will then be strong. --Blacky the Crow. After his discovery that Old Mother Nature had wrapped all the ears of corn in extra thick husks, Blacky had no doubt in his own mind that Johnny Chuck and Jerry Muskrat and Paddy the Beaver and the Quacks were quite right in feeling that the coming winter would be long, hard and cold. But Blacky long ago learned that it isn't wise or wholly safe to depend altogether on one thing. “Old Mother Nature never does things by halves,” thought Blacky, as he sat on the fence post on the Green Meadows, thinking over his discovery of the thick husks on the corn. “She wouldn't take care to protect the corn that way and not do as much for other things. There must be other signs, if I am smart enough to find them.” He lifted one black wing and began to set in order the feathers beneath it. Suddenly he made a funny little hop straight up. “Well, I never!” he exclaimed, as he spread his wings to regain his balance. “I never did!” “Is that so?” piped a squeaky little voice. “If you say you never did, I suppose you never did, though I want the word of some one else before I will believe it. What is it you never did?” Blacky looked down. Peeping up at him from the brown grass were two bright little eyes. “Hello, Danny Meadow Mouse!” exclaimed Blacky. “I haven't seen you for a long time. I've looked for you several times lately.” “I don't doubt it. I don't doubt it at all,” squeaked Danny. “You'll never see me when you are looking for me. That is, you won't if I can help it. You won't if I see you first.” Blacky chuckled. He knew what Danny meant. When Blacky goes looking for Danny Meadow Mouse, it usually is in hope of having a Meadow Mouse dinner, and he knew that Danny knew this. “I've had my breakfast,” said Blacky, “and it isn't dinner time yet.” “What is it you never did?” persisted Danny, in his squeaky voice. “That was just an exclamation,” explained Blacky. “I made a discovery that surprised me so I exclaimed right out.” “What was it?” demanded Danny. “It was that the feathers of my coat are coming in thicker than I ever knew them to before. I hadn't noticed it until I started to set them in order a minute ago.” He buried his bill in the feathers of his breast. “Yes, sir,” said he in a muffled voice, “they are coming in thicker than I ever knew them to before. There is a lot of down around the roots of them. I am going to have the warmest coat I've ever had.” “Well, don't think you are the only one,” retorted Danny. “My fur never was so thick at this time of year as it is now, and it is the same way with Nanny Meadow Mouse and all our children. I suppose you know what it means.” “What does it mean?” asked Blacky, just as if he didn't have the least idea, although he had guessed the instant he discovered those extra feathers. “It means we are going to have a long, hard, cold winter, and Old Mother Nature is preparing us for it,” replied Danny, quite as if he knew all about it. “You'll find that everybody who doesn't go south or sleep all winter has a thicker coat than usual. Hello! There is old Roughleg the Hawk! He has come extra early this year. I think I'll go back to warn Nanny.” Without another word Danny disappeared in the brown grass. Again Blacky chuckled. “More signs,” said he to himself. “More signs. There isn't a doubt that we are going to have a hard winter. I wonder if I can stand it or if I'd better go a little way south, where it will be warmer.” CHAPTER XVII: Blacky Watches A Queer Performance This much to me is very clear: A thing not understood is queer. --Blacky the Crow. Blacky the Crow may be right. Again he may not be. If he is right, it will account for a lot of the queer people in the world. They are not understood, and so they are queer. At least, that is what other people say, and never once think that perhaps they are the queer ones for not understanding. But Blacky isn't like those people who are satisfied not to understand and to think other people and things queer. He does his best to understand. He waits and watches and uses those sharp eyes of his and those quick wits of his until at last usually he does understand. The day of his discovery of Old Mother Nature's signs that the coming winter would be long, hard and cold, Blacky paid a visit to the Big River. Long ago he discovered that many things are to be seen on or beside the Big River, things not to be seen elsewhere. So there are few clays in which he does not get over there. As he drew near the Big River, he was very watchful and careful, was Blacky, for this was the season when hunters with terrible guns were abroad, and he had discovered that they were likely to be hiding along the Big River, hoping to shoot Mr. or Mrs. Quack or some of their relatives. So he was very watchful as he drew near the Big River, for he had learned that it was dangerous to pass too near a hunter with a terrible gun. More than once he had been shot at. But he had learned by these experiences. Oh, yes, Blacky had learned. For one thing, he had learned to know a gun when he saw it. For another thing, he had learned just how far away one of these dreadful guns could be and still hurt the one it was pointed at, and to always keep just a little farther away. Also he had learned that a man or boy without a terrible gun is quite harmless, and he had learned that hunters with terrible guns are tricky and sometimes hide from those they seek to kill, so that in the dreadful hunting season it is best to look sharply before approaching any place. On this afternoon, as he drew near the Big River, he saw a man who seemed to be very busy on the shore of the Big River, at a place where wild rice and rushes grew for some distance out in the water, for just there it was shallow far out from the shore. Blacky looked sharply for a terrible gun. But the man had none with him and therefore was not to be feared. Blacky boldly drew near until he was able to see what the man was doing. Then Blacky's eyes stretched their widest and he almost cawed right out with surprise. The man was taking yellow corn from a bag, a handful at a time, and throwing it out in the water. Yes, Sir, that is what he was doing, scattering nice yellow corn among the rushes and wild rice in the water! “That's a queer performance,” muttered Blacky, as he watched. “What is he throwing perfectly good corn out in the water for? He isn't planting it, for this isn't the planting season. Besides, it wouldn't grow in the water, anyway. It is a shame to waste nice corn like that. What is he doing it for?” Blacky flew over to a tree some distance away and alighted in the top of it to watch the queer performance. You know Blacky has very keen eyes and he can see a long distance. For a while the man continued to scatter corn and Blacky continued to wonder what he was doing it for. At last the man went away in a boat. Blacky watched him until he was out of sight. Then he spread his wings and slowly flew back and forth just above the rushes and wild rice, at the place where the man had been scattering the corn. He could see some of the yellow grains on the bottom. Presently he saw something else. “Ha!” exclaimed Blacky. CHAPTER XVIII: Blacky Becomes Very Suspicious Of things you do not understand, Beware! They may be wholly harmless but-- Beware! You'll find the older that you grow That only things and folks you know Are fully to be trusted, so Beware! --Blacky the Crow. That is one of Blacky's wise sayings, and he lives up to it. It is one reason why he has come to be regarded by all his neighbors as one of the smartest of all who live in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadow. He seldom gets into any real trouble because he first makes sure there is no trouble to get into. When he discovers something he does not understand, he is at once distrustful of it. As he watched a man scattering yellow corn in the water from the shore of the Big River he at once became suspicious. He couldn't understand why a man should throw good corn among the rushes and wild rice in the water, and because he couldn't understand, he at once began to suspect that it was for no good purpose. When the man left in a boat, Blacky slowly flew over the rushes where the man had thrown the corn, and presently his sharp eyes made a discovery that caused him to exclaim right out. What was it Blacky had discovered? Only a few feathers. No one with eyes less sharp than Blacky's would have noticed them. And few would have given them a thought if they had noticed them. But Blacky knew right away that those were feathers from a Duck. He knew that a Duck, or perhaps a flock of Ducks, had been resting or feeding in there among those rushes, and that in moving about they had left those two or three downy feathers. “Ha!” exclaimed Blacky. “Mr. and Mrs. Quack or some of their relatives have been here. It is just the kind of a place Ducks like. Also some Ducks like corn. If they should come back here and find this corn, they would have a feast, and they would be sure to come again. That man who scattered the corn here didn't have a terrible gun, but that doesn't mean that he isn't a hunter. He may come back again, and then he may have a terrible gun. I'm suspicious of that man. I am so. I believe he put that corn here for Ducks and I don't believe he did it out of the kindness of his heart. If it was Farmer Brown's boy I would know that all is well; that he was thinking of hungry Ducks, with few places where they can feed in safety, as they make the long journey from the Far North to the Sunny South. But it wasn't Farmer Brown's boy. I don't like the looks of it. I don't indeed. I'll keep watch of this place and see what happens.” All the way to his favorite perch in a certain big hemlock-tree in the Green Forest, Blacky kept thinking about that corn and the man who had seemed to be generous with it, and the more he thought, the more suspicious he became. He didn't like the looks of it at all. “I'll warn the Quacks to keep away from there. I'll do it the very first thing in the morning,” he muttered, as he prepared to go to sleep. “If they have any sense at all, they will stay in the pond of Paddy the Beaver. But if they should go over to the Big River, they would be almost sure to find that corn, and if they should once find it, they would keep going back for more. It may be all right, but I don't like the looks of it.” And still full of suspicions, Blacky went to sleep. CHAPTER XIX: Blacky Makes More Discoveries Little things you fail to see May important prove to be. --Blacky the Crow. One of the secrets of Blacky's success in life is the fact that he never fails to take note of little things. Long ago he learned that little things which in themselves seem harmless and not worth noticing may together prove the most important things in life. So, no matter how unimportant a thing may appear, Blacky examines it closely with those sharp eyes of his and remembers it. The very first thing Blacky did, as soon as he was awake the morning after he discovered the man scattering corn in the rushes at a certain place on the edge of the Big River, was to fly over to the pond of Paddy the Beaver and again warn Mr. and Mrs. Quack to keep away from the Big River, if they and their six children would remain safe. Then he got some breakfast. He ate it in a hurry and flew straight over to the Big River to the place where he had seen that yellow corn scattered. Blacky wasn't wholly surprised to find Dusky the Black Duck, own cousin to Mr. and Mrs. Quack the Mallard Ducks, with a number of his relatives in among the rushes and wild rice at the very place where that corn had been scattered. They seemed quite contented and in the best of spirits. Blacky guessed why. Not a single grain of that yellow corn could Blacky see. He knew the ways of Dusky and his relatives. He knew that they must have come in there just at dusk the night before and at once had found that corn. He knew that they would remain hiding there until frightened out, and that then they would spend the day in some little pond where they would let him go. However, there was nothing for it but to have him brought back, with some state in the way of Life Guards, to Whitehall. And as soon as he got there, in his infatuation, he heard mass, and set a Jesuit to say grace at his public dinner. The people had been thrown into the strangest state of confusion by his flight, and had taken it into their heads that the Irish part of the army were going to murder the Protestants. Therefore, they set the bells a ringing, and lighted watch-fires, and burned Catholic Chapels, and looked about in all directions for Father Petre and the Jesuits, while the Pope’s ambassador was running away in the dress of a footman. They found no Jesuits; but a man, who had once been a frightened witness before Jeffreys in court, saw a swollen, drunken face looking through a window down at Wapping, which he well remembered. The face was in a sailor’s dress, but he knew it to be the face of that accursed judge, and he seized him. The people, to their lasting honour, did not tear him to pieces. After knocking him about a little, they took him, in the basest agonies of terror, to the Lord Mayor, who sent him, at his own shrieking petition, to the Tower for safety. There, he died. Their bewilderment continuing, the people now lighted bonfires and made rejoicings, as if they had any reason to be glad to have the King back again. But, his stay was very short, for the English guards were removed from Whitehall, Dutch guards were marched up to it, and he was told by one of his late ministers that the Prince would enter London, next day, and he had better go to Ham. He said, Ham was a cold, damp place, and he would rather go to Rochester. He thought himself very cunning in this, as he meant to escape from Rochester to France. The Prince of Orange and his friends knew that, perfectly well, and desired nothing more. So, he went to Gravesend, in his royal barge, attended by certain lords, and watched by Dutch troops, and pitied by the generous people, who were far more forgiving than he had ever been, when they saw him in his humiliation. On the night of the twenty-third of December, not even then understanding that everybody wanted to get rid of him, he went out, absurdly, through his Rochester garden, down to the Medway, and got away to France, where he rejoined the Queen. There had been a council in his absence, of the lords, and the authorities of London. When the Prince came, on the day after the King’s departure, he summoned the Lords to meet him, and soon afterwards, all those who had served in any of the Parliaments of King Charles the Second. It was finally resolved by these authorities that the throne was vacant by the conduct of King James the Second; that it was inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom, to be governed by a Popish prince; that the Prince and Princess of Orange should be King and Queen during their lives and the life of the survivor of them; and that their children should succeed them, if they had any. That if they had none, the Princess Anne and her children should succeed; that if she had none, the heirs of the Prince of Orange should succeed. On the thirteenth of January, one thousand six hundred and eighty-nine, the Prince and Princess, sitting on a throne in Whitehall, bound themselves to these conditions. The Protestant religion was established in England, and England’s great and glorious Revolution was complete. CHAPTER XXXVII I have now arrived at the close of my little history. The events which succeeded the famous Revolution of one thousand six hundred and eighty-eight, would neither be easily related nor easily understood in such a book as this. William and Mary reigned together, five years. After the death of his good wife, William occupied the throne, alone, for seven years longer. During his reign, on the sixteenth of September, one thousand seven hundred and one, the poor weak creature who had once been James the Second of England, died in France. In the meantime he had done his utmost (which was not much) to cause William to be assassinated, and to regain his lost dominions. James’s son was declared, by the French King, the rightful King of England; and was called in France The Chevalier Saint George, and in England The Pretender. Some infatuated people in England, and particularly in Scotland, took up the Pretender’s cause from time to time—as if the country had not had Stuarts enough!—and many lives were sacrificed, and much misery was occasioned. King William died on Sunday, the seventh of March, one thousand seven hundred and two, of the consequences of an accident occasioned by his horse stumbling with him. He was always a brave, patriotic Prince, and a man of remarkable abilities. His manner was cold, and he made but few friends; but he had truly loved his queen. When he was dead, a lock of her hair, in a ring, was found tied with a black ribbon round his left arm. He was succeeded by the Princess Anne, a popular Queen, who reigned twelve years. In her reign, in the month of May, one thousand seven hundred and seven, the Union between England and Scotland was effected, and the two countries were incorporated under the name of Great Britain. Then, from the year one thousand seven hundred and fourteen to the year one thousand, eight hundred and thirty, reigned the four Georges. It was in the reign of George the Second, one thousand seven hundred and forty-five, that the Pretender did his last mischief, and made his last appearance. Being an old man by that time, he and the Jacobites—as his friends were called—put forward his son, Charles Edward, known as the young Chevalier. The Highlanders of Scotland, an extremely troublesome and wrong-headed race on the subject of the Stuarts, espoused his cause, and he joined them, and there was a Scottish rebellion to make him king, in which many gallant and devoted gentlemen lost their lives. It was a hard matter for Charles Edward to escape abroad again, with a high price on his head; but the Scottish people were extraordinarily faithful to him, and, after undergoing many romantic adventures, not unlike those of Charles the Second, he escaped to France. A number of charming stories and delightful songs arose out of the Jacobite feelings, and belong to the Jacobite times. Otherwise I think the Stuarts were a public nuisance altogether. It was in the reign of George the Third that England lost North America, by persisting in taxing her without her own consent. That immense country, made independent under Washington, and left to itself, became the United States; one of the greatest nations of the earth. In these times in which I write, it is honourably remarkable for protecting its subjects, wherever they may travel, with a dignity and a determination which is a model for England. Between you and me, England has rather lost ground in this respect since the days of Oliver Cromwell. The Union of Great Britain with Ireland—which had been getting on very ill by itself—took place in the reign of George the Third, on the second of July, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight. William the Fourth succeeded George the Fourth, in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty, and reigned seven years. Queen Victoria, his niece, the only child of the Duke of Kent, the fourth son of George the Third, came to the throne on the twentieth of June, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven. She was married to Prince Albert of Saxe Gotha on the tenth of February, one thousand eight hundred and forty. She is very good, and much beloved. So I end, like the crier, with God Save the Queen! = = = PG67149 = = = A CHILD’S HISTORY OF THE WORLD A CHILD’S HISTORY OF THE WORLD By V. M.

This part is not for you, either. It is for your father, mother, or teacher, and is what they would call the INTRODUCTION In common with all children of my age, I was brought up on American History and given no other history but American, year in and year out, year after year for eight or more years. So far as I knew 1492 was the beginning of the world. Any events or characters before that time, reference to which I encountered by any chance, were put down in my mind in the same category with fairy-tales. Christ and His times, of which I heard only in Sunday-school, were to me mere fiction without reality. They were not mentioned in any history that I knew and therefore, so I thought, must belong _not_ to a realm in time and space, but to a spiritual realm. To give an American child only American History is as provincial as to teach a Texas child only Texas History. Patriotism is usually given as the reason for such history teaching. It only promotes a narrow-mindedness and an absurd conceit, based on utter ignorance of any other peoples and any other times--an intolerant egotism without foundation in fact. Since the World War it has become increasingly more and more important that American children should have a knowledge of other countries and other peoples in order that their attitude may be intelligent and unprejudiced. As young as nine years of age, a child is eagerly inquisitive as to what has taken place in the ages past and readily grasps a concept of World History. Therefore, for many years Calvert School nine-year-old pupils have been taught World History in spite of academic and parental skepticism and antagonism. But I have watched the gradual drift toward adoption of this plan of history teaching, and with it an ever-increasing demand for a text-book of general history for young children. I have found, however, that all existing text-books have to be largely abridged and also supplemented by a running explanation and comment, to make them intelligible to the young child. The recent momentous studies into the native intelligence of children show us what the average child at different ages can understand and what he cannot understand--what dates, figures of speech, vocabulary, generalities, and abstractions he can comprehend and what he cannot comprehend--and in the future all text-books will have to be written with constant regard for these intelligence norms. Otherwise, such texts are very likely to be “over the child’s head.” They will be trying to teach him some things at least that, in the nature of the case, are beyond him. In spite of the fact that the writer has been in constant contact with the child mind for a great many years, he has found that whatever was written in his study had to be revised and rewritten each time after the lesson had been tried out in the class-room. Even though the first writing was in what he considered the simplest language, he has found that each and every word and expression has had to be subjected again and again to this class-room test to determine what meaning is conveyed. The slightest inverted phraseology or possibility of double meaning has oftentimes been misconstrued or found confusing. For instance, the statement that “Rome was _on_ the Tiber River” has quite commonly been taken to mean that the city was literally built _on top_ of the river, and the child has had some sort of fantastic vision of houses built on piles in the river. A child of nine is still very young--he may still believe in Santa Claus--younger in ideas, in vocabulary and in understanding than most adults appreciate--even though they be parents or teachers--and new information can hardly be put too simply. So the topics selected have not always been the most important--but the most important that can be understood and appreciated by a child. Most political, sociological, economic, or religious generalities are beyond a child’s comprehension, no matter how simply told. After all, this History is only a preliminary story. Excellent biographies and stories from general history have been written. But biographies from history do not give an historic outline. They do not give any outline at all for future filling in; and, indeed, unless they themselves are fitted into such a general historical scheme, they are nothing more than so many disconnected tales floating about in the child’s mind with no associations of time or space. The treatment of the subject in this book is, therefore, chronological--telling the story of what has happened century by century and epoch by epoch, not by nations. The story of one nation is interrupted to take up that of another as different plots in a novel are brought forward simultaneously. This is in line with the purpose, which is to give the pupil a continuous view or panorama of the ages, rather than Greek History from start to finish, then, retracing the steps of time, Roman History, and so on. The object is to sketch the whole picture in outline, leaving the details to be gradually filled in by later study, as the artist sketches the general scheme of his picture before filling in the details. Such a scheme is as necessary to orderly classification of historical knowledge as is a filing system in any office that can function properly or even at all. The Staircase of Time is to give a visual idea of the extent of time and the progressive steps in the History of the World. Each “flight” represents a thousand years, and each “step” a hundred--a century. If you have a spare wall, either in the play-room, attic, or barn such a Staircase of Time on a large scale may be drawn upon it from floor to reaching height and made a feature if elaborated with pictures or drawings of people and events. If the wall faces the child’s bed so much the better, for when lying awake in the morning or at any other time, instead of imagining fantastic designs on the wall-paper, he may picture the crowded events on the Staircase of Time. At any rate, the child should constantly refer either to such a Staircase of Time or to the Time Table as each event is studied, until he has a mental image of the Ages past. At first a child does not appreciate time values represented by numbers or the relative position of dates on a time line and will wildly say twenty-five hundred B. C. or twenty-five thousand B. C. or twenty-five million B. C. indiscriminately. Only by constantly referring dates to position on the Staircase of Time or the Time Table can a child come to visualize dates. You may be _amused_, but do not be _amazed_, if a child gives 776 thousand years A.D. as the date for the First Olympiad, or says that Italy is located in Athens, or that Abraham was a hero of the Trojan War. If you have ever been introduced to a roomful of strangers at one time, you know how futile it is to attempt even to remember their names to say nothing of connecting names and faces. It is necessary to hear something interesting about each one before you can begin to recall names and faces. Likewise an introduction to World History, the characters and places in which are utterly unknown strangers to the child, must be something more than a mere name introduction, and there must be very few introductions given at a time or both names and faces will be instantly forgotten. It is also necessary to repeat new names constantly in order that the pupil may gradually become familiarized with them, for so many strange people and places are bewildering. In order to serve the purpose of a basal outline, which in the future is to be filled in, it is necessary that the Time Table be made a permanent possession of the pupil. This Time Table, therefore, should be studied like the multiplication tables until it is known one hundred per cent and for “keeps,” and until the topic connected with each date can be elaborated as much as desired. The aim should be to have the pupil able to start with Primitive Man and give a summary of World History to the present time, with dates and chief events without prompting, questioning, hesitation, or mistake. Does this seem too much to expect? It is not as difficult as it may sound, if suggestions given in the text for connecting the various events into a sequence and for passing names and events in a condensed review are followed. Hundreds of Calvert children each year are successfully required to do this very thing. The attitude, however, usually assumed by teachers, that “even if the pupil forgets it all, there will be left a valuable impression,” is too often an apology for superficial teaching and superficial learning. History may be made just as much a “mental discipline” as some other studies, but only if difficulties of dates and other abstractions are squarely met and overcome by hard study and learned to be remembered, not merely to be forgotten after the recitation. The story part the child will easily remember, but it is the “who and when and where and why” that are important, and this part is the serious study. Instead of, “A man, once upon a time,” he should say, “King John in 1215 at Runnymede because--” This book, therefore, is not a supplementary reader but a basal history study. Just enough narrative is told to give the skeleton flesh and blood and make it living. The idea is not how much but how little can be told; to cut down one thousand pages to less than half of that number without leaving only dry bones. No matter how the subject is presented it is necessary that the child do his part and put his own brain to work; and for this purpose he _should be required to retell each story after he has read it_ and should be repeatedly questioned on names and dates as well as stories, to make sure he is retaining and assimilating what he hears. I recall how once upon a time a young chap, just out of college, taught his first class in history. With all the enthusiasm of a full-back who has just kicked a goal from field, he talked, he sang; he drew maps on the blackboard, on the floor, on the field; he drew pictures, he vaulted desks, and even stood on his head to illustrate points. His pupils attended spellbound, with their eyes wide open, their ears wide open, and their mouths wide open. They missed nothing. They drank in his flow of words with thirst unquenched; but, like Baron Munchausen, he had failed to look at the other end of the drinking horse that had been cut in half. At the end of a month his kindly principal suggested a test, and he gave it with perfect confidence. There were only three questions: And here are the three answers of one of the most interested pupils: (1) He was a _grate_ man. (2) “ “ “ “ “ (3) “ “ “ “ “ _to_. Here is the STAIRCASE OF TIME It starts far, far, below the bottom of the pages and rises up, UP, UP to where we are NOW--each step a hundred years, each flight of steps a thousand. It will keep on up until it reaches high heaven. From where we are NOW let us look down the flights below us and listen to the Story of what has happened in the long years gone by. [Illustration] TIME TABLE with DATES AND OTHER FOOD FOR THOUGHT _Don’t devour these dates all at once, or they’ll make you sick, and you’ll never want to see one again._ _Take them piecemeal, only one or two at a time after each story, and be sure to digest them thoroughly._ A CHILD’S HISTORY OF THE WORLD BEGINS HERE 1 How Things Started Once upon a time there was a boy-- Just like me. He had to stay in bed in the morning until seven o’clock until his father and mother were ready to get up; So did I. As he was always awake long before this time, he used to lie there and think about all sorts of curious things; So did I. One thing he used to wonder was this: What would the world be like if there were-- No fathers and mothers, No uncles and aunts, No cousins or other children to play with, _No people at all, except himself_ in the whole world! Perhaps you have wondered the same thing; So did I. At last he used to get so lonely, just from thinking how dreadful such a world would be, that he could stand it no longer and would run to his mother’s room and jump into bed by her side just to get this terrible thought out of his mind; So did I--for _I was the boy_. Well, there _was_ a time long, long, long ago when there were no men or women or children, _NO PEOPLE_ of any kind in the whole world. Of course there were no houses, for there was no one to build them or to live in them, no towns or cities--nothing that people make. There were just wild animals--bears and wolves, birds and butterflies, frogs and snakes, turtles and fish. Can you think of such a world as that? Then, long, long, long before that, there was a time when there were _NO PEOPLE_ and _NO ANIMALS_ of any sort in the whole world; there were just growing plants, trees and bushes, grass and flowers. Can you think of such a world as that? Then, long, long, long, long, long, long before that, there was a time when there were _NO PEOPLE, NO ANIMALS, NO PLANTS_, in the whole world; there was just bare rock and water everywhere. Can you think of such a world as that? Then, long, long, long long, long, long--you might keep on saying-- “long, long, long,” all day, and to-morrow, and all next week, and next month, and next year, and it would not be long enough-- before this, there was a time when there was _NO WORLD AT ALL!_ There were only the Stars Nothing else! Now, real Stars are not things with points like those in the corner of a flag or the gold ones you put on a Christmas tree. The real stars in the sky have no points. They are huge burning coals of fire--coals of fire. Each star, however, is so huge that there is nothing in the world now anywhere nearly as big. One little bit, one little scrap of a star is bigger than our whole world--than our whole world. One of these stars is our Sun--yes, our Sun. The other stars would look the same as the Sun if we could get as close to them. But at that time, so long, long ago, our Sun was not just a big, round, white, hot ball as we see it in the sky to-day. It was then more like the fireworks you may have seen on the Fourth of July. It was whirling and sputtering and throwing off sparks. [Illustration: The sun sputtering and throwing off sparks.] One of these sparks which the Sun threw far off got cool just as a spark from the crackling log in the fireplace gets cool, and this cooled-off spark was-- What do you suppose? See if you can guess-- It was our World!--yes, the World on which we now live. At first, however, our World or Earth was nothing but a ball of rock. This ball of rock was wrapped around with steam, like a heavy fog. Then the steam turned to rain and it rained on the World, a a a n n n d d d i i i t t t r r r a a a i i i n n n e e e d d d until it had filled up the hollows and made enormously big puddles. These puddles were the oceans. The dry places were bare _rock_. Then, after this, came the first living things--_tiny plants_ that you could only have seen under a microscope. At first they grew only in the water, then along the water’s edge, then out on the rock. Then dirt or soil, as people call it, formed all over the rock and made the rock into land, and the plants grew larger and spread farther over the land. Then, after this, came the first _tiny animals_ in the water. They were wee _Mites_ like drops of jelly. Then, after this, came things like _Insects_, some that live _in_ the water, some _on_ the water, some _on_ the land, and some _in_ the air. Then, after this, came _Fish_, that live only in the water. Then, after this, came _Frogs_, that live in the water and on the land, too. Then, after this, came _Snakes_ and huge _lizards_ bigger than alligators, more like dragons; and they grew so big that at last they could not move and died because they could not get enough food to eat. Then, after this, came _Birds_ that lay eggs and those _Animals_ like foxes and elephants and cows that nurse their babies when they are born. Then, after this, came _Monkeys_. Then, last of all, came--what do you suppose? Yes--_People_--men, women, and children. Here are the steps; see if you can take them: STAR, SUN; SUN, SPARK; SPARK, WORLD; WORLD, STEAM; STEAM, RAIN; RAIN, OCEANS. OCEANS, PLANTS; PLANTS, MITES; MITES, INSECTS; INSECTS, FISH; FISH, FROGS; FROGS, SNAKES. SNAKES, BIRDS; BIRDS, ANIMALS; ANIMALS, MONKEYS; MONKEYS, PEOPLE; And here we are! What do you suppose will be next? 2 Umfa-Umfa and Itchy-Scratchy How do you suppose I know about all these things that took place so long ago? I don’t. I’m only guessing about them. But there are different kinds of guesses. If I hold out my two closed hands and ask you to guess which one has the penny in it, that is one kind of a guess. Your guess might be right or it might be wrong. It would be just luck. But there is another kind of a guess. When there is snow on the ground and I see tracks of a boot in the snow, I guess that a man must have passed by, for boots don’t usually walk without some one in them. That kind of a guess is not just luck but common sense. And so we can guess about a great many things that have taken place long ago, even though there was no one there at the time to see them or tell about them. Men have dug down deep under the ground in different parts of the world and have found there--what do you suppose? I don’t believe you would ever guess. They have found the heads of arrows and spears and hatchets. The peculiar thing about these arrows and spears and hatchets is that they are not made of iron or steel, as you might expect, but of stone. Now, we are sure that only men could have made and used such things, for birds and fish or other animals do not use hatchets or spears. We are also sure that these men must have lived long, long years ago before iron and steel were known, because it must have taken long, long years for these things to have become covered up so deep by dust and dirt. We have also found the bones of the people themselves, who must have died thousands upon thousands of years ago, long before any one began to write down history. So we know that the people who were living on the earth then were working and playing, eating and fighting--doing many of the same things we are to-day--especially the fighting. This time in the pre-history of the world, when people used such things made of stone, is therefore called THE STONE AGE. These First Stone Age People we call _Primitive_, which simply means First as a Primer means First Reader. Primitive People were wild animals. Unlike other wild animals, however, they walked on their hind legs. These First People had hair growing, not just on their heads, but all over their bodies, like some shaggy dogs. They had no houses of any sort in which to live. They simply lay down on the ground when night came. Later, when the earth became cold, they found caves in the rocks or in the hillsides where they could get away from the cold and storms and other wild animals. So men, women, and children of this time were called _Cave People_. They spent their days hunting some animals and running and hiding from others. They caught animals by trapping them in a pit covered over with bushes, or they killed them with a club or a rock if they had a chance, or with stone-headed arrows or hatchets. They even drew pictures of these animals on the walls of their caves, scratching the picture with a pointed stone, and some of these pictures we can still see to-day. They lived on berries and nuts and grass-seeds. They robbed the nests of birds for the eggs, which they ate raw, for they had no fire to cook with. They were blood-thirsty; they liked to drink the warm blood of animals they killed, as you would a glass of milk. They talked to each other by some sort of grunts-- “Umfa, umfa, glug, glug.” They made clothes of skins of animals they killed, for there was no such thing as cloth. And yet, although they were real men, they lived so much like wild animals that we call such people _savages_. Primitive Men were not pleasant people. They were fearful and cruel creatures, who beat and killed and robbed whenever they had a chance. A cave man got his wife by stealing a girl away from her own cave home, knocking her senseless, and dragging her off by her hair, if necessary. The men were fighters but not brave. They would kill other animals and other men if the others were weaker or if they could sneak upon them and catch them off their guard, but if others were stronger they would run and hide. Their only rule of life was hurt and kill what you can, and run from what you can’t. This is what we call the first law of nature--every man for himself. They knew if they didn’t kill they would be killed, for there were no laws nor police to protect them. These primitive cave people are our ancestors, and we get from them many of their wild ways. In spite of our religion and manners and education, there are many men still living who act in the same way when they get a chance. Jails are made for such men. Suppose you had been a boy or a girl in the Stone Age, with a name like Itchy-Scratchy. I wonder how you would have liked the life. When you woke up in the morning, you would not have bathed or even washed your hands and face or brushed your teeth or combed your hair. You ate with your fingers, for there were no knives or forks or spoons or cups or saucers, only one bowl--which your mother had made out of mud and dried in the sun to hold water to drink--no dishes to wash and put away, no chairs, no tables, no table manners. There were no books, no paper, no pencils. There was no Saturday or Sunday, January or July. Except that one day was warm and sunny or another cold and rainy, they were all alike. There was no school to go to. Every day was a holiday. There was nothing to do all day long but make mud pies or pick berries or play tag with your brothers and sisters. I wonder how you would like that kind of life! “Fine!” do you think?--“a great life--just like camping out?” But I have only told you part of the story. The cave would have been cold and damp and dark, with only the bare ground or a pile of leaves for a bed. There would probably have been bats and big spiders sharing the cave with you. You might have had on the skin of some animal your father had killed but as this only covered part of your body and as there was no fire, you would have felt cold in winter, and when it got very cold you might have frozen to death. For breakfast you might have had some dried berries or grass-seed or a piece of raw meat, for dinner the same thing, for supper still the same thing. You would never have had any bread or milk or griddle-cakes with syrup, or oatmeal with sugar on it, or apple pie or ice-cream. There was nothing to do all day long but watch out for wild animals--bears and tigers; for there was no door with lock and key, and a tiger, if he found you out, could go wherever you went and “get you” even in your cave. And then some day your father, who had left the cave in the morning to go hunting, would not return, and you would know he had been torn to pieces by some wild beast, and you would wonder how long before your turn would come next. Do you think you would like to have lived then? 3 Fire! Fire!! Fire!!! The first things are usually the most interesting--the first baby, the first tooth, the first step, the first word, the first spanking. This book will be chiefly the story of first things; those that came second or third or fourth or fifth you can read about and study later. Primitive People did not at first know what fire was. They had no matches nor any way of making a light or a fire. They had no light at night. They had no fire to warm themselves by. They had no fire with which to cook their food. Somewhere and sometime, we do not know exactly when or how, they found out how to make and use fire. If you rub your hands together rapidly, they become warm. Try it. If you rub them together still more rapidly, they become hot. If you rub two sticks together rapidly, they become warm. If you rub two sticks together very, very, very rapidly, they become hot and at last, if you keep it up long enough and fast enough, are set on fire. The Indians and boy scouts do this and make a fire by twisting one stick against another. This was one of the first inventions, and this invention was as remarkable for them at that time as the invention of electric light in our own times. People of the Stone Age had hair and beards that were never cut, because they had nothing to cut them with, even had they wanted them short, which they probably didn’t. Their finger-nails grew like claws until they broke off. They had no clothes made of cloth, for they had no cloth and nothing with which to cut and sew cloth if they had. They had no saws to cut boards, no hammer or nails to fasten them together to make houses or furniture. They had no forks nor spoons; no pots nor pans; no buckets nor shovels; no needles nor pins. The People of the Stone Age had never seen or heard of such a thing as iron or steel or tin or brass or anything made of these metals. For thousands and thousands of years Primitive People got along without any of the things that are made of metal. Then one day a Stone Age Man found out something by accident; a “discovery” we call it. He was making a fire; and a fire, which is to us such a common, every-day thing, was still to him very wonderful. Round his fire he placed some rock to make a sort of camp-fire stove. Now, it happened that this particular rock was not ordinary rock but what we now call “ore,” for it had copper in it. The heat of the fire melted some of the copper out of the rock, and it ran out on the ground. What were those bright, shining drops? He examined them. How pretty they were! He heated some more of the same rock and got some more copper. [Illustration: A cave man discovering copper.] Thus was the first metal discovered. At first people used the copper for beads and ornaments, it was so bright and shiny. But they soon found out that copper could be pounded into sharp blades and points, which were much better than the stone knives and arrow-heads they had used before. But notice that it was not iron they discovered first, it was copper. We think people next discovered tin in somewhat the same way. Then, after that, they found out that tin when mixed with copper made a still harder and better metal than either alone. This metal, made of tin and copper together, we now call bronze; and for two or three thousand years people made their tools and weapons out of bronze. And so we call the time when men used bronze tools, and bronze weapons for hunting and fighting, the Bronze Age. At last some man discovered iron, and he soon saw that iron was better for most useful things than either copper or bronze. The Iron Age started with the discovery of iron, and we are still in the Iron Age. As people who lived in the Bronze and Iron Ages were able, after the discovery of metal, to do many things they could not possibly have done before with only stone, and as they lived much more as we do now, we call people of the Bronze and Iron Ages “civilized.” You may have heard in your mythology or fairy tales of a Golden Age also, but by this is meant something quite different. The Golden Age means a time when everything was beautiful and lovely and everybody wise and good. There have been times in the World’s History which have been called the Golden Age for this reason. But I am afraid there never has been really a golden age--only in fairy-tales. 4 From an Airplane People of the Bronze and Iron Ages thought the world was flat, and they knew only a little bit of the world, the small part where they lived; and they thought that if you went too far the world came to an end where you would TU M B L E O F F The far-away land which nobody knew they called the Ultima Thule. This is a nice name to say--Ultima Thule, Ultima Thule--far-away Ultima Thule. If we should go up in an airplane and look down on the world at the place where the first civilized people once lived, we should see two rivers, a sea and a gulf, and from so high up in the air they would look something like this: [Illustration: Map of Mesopotamia and Mediterranean.] Now, you probably have never even heard of these rivers and seas, and yet they have been known longer than any other places in the world. One of these lines is the Tigris River, and the other is the Euphrates. They run along getting closer and closer together until at last they join each other and flow into what is called the Persian Gulf. You might make these two rivers in the ground of your yard or garden or draw them on the floor if your mother will let you. Just for fun you might name your drinking-cup “Tigris” and your glass “Euphrates.” Then you might call your mouth, into which they both empty, the “Persian Gulf,” for you will hear a great many new names by and by, and as grown-up people give names to their houses and boats, to their horses and dogs, why shouldn’t you give names to things that belong to you? For instance, you might call your chair, your bed, your table, your comb and brush, even your hat and shoes, after these strange names. Then, if we flew in our airplane to the west, we should see a country called Egypt, another river, the Nile, and a sea now named the Mediterranean. Mediterranean simply means “between the land,” for this sea is surrounded by land. It is, indeed, almost like a big lake. It is supposed that long, long ago in the Stone Age, there was no water at all where this sea now is, only a dry valley, and that people once lived there. Along the Nile in Egypt and the Tigris and Euphrates were the only civilized nations living in the Bronze Age. The rest of the World people knew nothing about. There may have been Cave Men living in other parts of the World, but it is only of the people in these two places that we have any written history until after the Iron Age began. All of the people who lived in the country of the Tigris and Euphrates were white. We don’t know how nor when nor where colored people first lived, though it is interesting to guess. There were, we think, just three different white families and from these three families all the white people in the world are descended. Yes, your family came from here, ’way, ’way, ’way, ’way, back. So you will want to know the names of these three families and which one was your own. They were: The Indo-Europeans, often called Aryans, The Semites, and The Hamites. Most of us belong to the Aryan family, some are Semites, but very few in this part of the World are Hamites. If your name is Henry or Charles or William, you are probably an Aryan. If it is Moses or Solomon, you are probably a Semite. If it is Shufu or Rameses, you are probably a Hamite. The Aryans came from higher up on the map than the other two families, we think. They were the first people to tame wild horses and to use them for riding and drawing carts. They also had tamed cows which they used for milk, and sheep for their wool. 5 Real History Begins or ’Way ’Way Back to the Time of the Gipsies You can remember the big things that have happened in your own lifetime. And you have of course heard your father tell about things that happened in his own life--how he fought the Germans in the Great War, perhaps. And if your grandfather is still living, he can tell you still other stories of things that took place when he was a boy before even your father was born. Perhaps your great, great, grandfather may have been living when Washington was President, and _his_ great, great, great, great, grandfather may have been living when there were only wild Indians in this country. Although these ancestors, as they are called, are dead long since, the story of what did happen in all their lifetimes ’way, ’way back has been written down in books and this story is history--“his story” one boy named it. Christ was living in the Year 1--no, not the first year of the world, of course. Do you know how many years ago that was? You can tell if you know what year this is now. If Christ were living to-day, how old would He be? Nineteen hundred and more years may seem a long time. But perhaps you have seen or heard of a man or a woman who was a hundred years old. Have you? Well, in nineteen hundred years only nineteen men each a hundred years old might have lived one after the other--nineteen men one after the other since the time of Christ--and that doesn’t seem so long after all! Everything that happened _before_ Christ was born is called B.C., which you can guess are the initials of Before Christ, so B.C. stands for Before Christ. So much is easy. Everything that has happened in the world _since_ the time of Christ is called A.D. This is not so easy for though A. might stand for After, we know D. is not the initial of Christ. As a matter of fact, A. D. are the initials of two Latin words, “Anno Domini.” Anno means “in the year,” Domini “of the Lord”; so that Anno Domini is “in the year, of the Lord,” which in ordinary, every-day language means of course “since the time of Christ.” The things I have told you that I have had to guess at we call Before-History, or _Pre-History_--which means the same thing. But the things that have happened in the lifetime of people, who have written them down--the stories I don’t have to guess at--we call _History_. The first history that we feel fairly sure is really true begins with the Hamite family. The Hamites, you remember, were one of the three families of the white race I have already told you about who lived by the Tigris and Euphrates. We think that they moved away from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and went down to Egypt long before history began. Of course they didn’t pack all their furniture on a big wagon and move to Egypt, as you might move from the house where you now live to another. They lived in tents then and not in houses at all, and they only moved along a day’s journey at a time as campers or Gipsies might do. In fact, Gipsy is short for Egyptian. When they got tired of one place or had eaten up everything there was near-by, they rolled up their tents, packed them on camels, and moved a little farther along to a new place. And so camping here for a while, then gradually moving farther along to the next good place and camping there, they at last got as far off as the land we now call Egypt. When they finally reached Egypt they found it such a fine country in which to live that there they stayed for good and were called Egyptians. Why do you suppose they found Egypt such a fine country in which to live? It was chiefly on account of a habit of the river Nile--a bad habit you might at first think it--a habit of flooding the country once every year. It rains so hard in the spring that the water fills up the river Nile, overflows its banks, and spreads far out over the land, but not very deep. It is as if you had left a water-spigot turned on and the water running, or had begun to water your garden with a hose, and then you had gone off and forgotten it. But the people know when the overflow is coming and they are glad for it to come, so they put banks around some of it so that it is stored up for watering the land during the rest of the year when there is no rain. After most of the water has dried up, it has left a layer of rich, dark, moist earth over the whole country. In this earth it is easy to grow dates, wheat, and other things which are good for food. If it were not for this yearly overflow of the Nile, the country of Egypt would be a sandy desert in which no plant or living thing would grow--for all plants as well as animals must have water and will die without it. Egypt, without water, would be like the great Sahara Desert, which is not far away. It is the Nile, therefore, that makes the land so rich and Egypt such an easy and cheap country to live in, for food grows with little or no labor and costs almost nothing. Besides this, the climate is so warm that people need little clothing and do not have to buy coal or make fires to heat their houses. So it was to this country that the Hamites at last came, finally settled down, and were thereafter called Egyptians. [Illustration: Menes, 3400 B. C.] The first Egyptian king whose name we know was Menes, but we do not know much about him. We believe he built some kind of waterworks so that the people might better use the water of the Nile, and he probably lived about 3400 B. C. He may have lived either earlier or later, but as this is an easy date to remember, we shall take it for a starting-point. You might remember it by supposing it is a telephone number of a person you wanted to call up: Menes, First Egyptian king . . 3400 B.C. [Illustration] 6 The Puzzle-Writers People of the Stone Age had learned how to talk to each other, but they could not write, for there was no such thing as an alphabet or written words, and so they could not send notes or messages to one another or write stories. The Egyptians were the first people to think of a way to write what they wanted to say. The Egyptians did not write with letters like ours, however, but with signs that looked like little pictures, a lion, a spear, a bird, a whip. This picture-writing was called hieroglyphics--see if you can say “Hi-e-ro-glyph-ics.” Perhaps you have seen, in the puzzle sections of a newspaper, stories written in pictures for you to guess the meaning. Well, hieroglyphics were something like that. Here is the name of an Egyptian queen, whom you will hear about later--written in hieroglyphics; her name you would never guess from this funny writing. It is “Cleopatra.” A king’s or queen’s name always had a line drawn around it, like the one you see around the above name in order to mark it more prominently and give it more importance. It was something like the square or circle your mother may put around her initials or monogram on her letter-paper. But there was no paper in those days and so the Egyptians wrote on the leaves of a plant called papyrus that grew in the water. It is from this name “papyrus” that we get the name “paper.” Can you see that “paper” and “papyrus” look and sound something alike? The Egyptians’ books were written by hand, of course, but they had no pencils nor pens nor ink to write with. For a pen they used a reed, split at the end, and for ink a mixture of water and soot. [Illustration: Cleopatra in hieroglyphic writing.] Their books were not made of separate pages like our books, but from a long sheet of papyrus-leaves pasted together. This was rolled up to form what was called a scroll, something like a roll of wall-paper, and was read as it was unrolled. Stories of their kings and battles and great events in their history they used to write on the walls of their buildings and monuments. This writing they carved into the stone, so that it would last much longer than that on the papyrus-leaves. All the old Egyptians, who wrote in hieroglyphics and knew how to read this writing, had died long since, and for a great many years no one knew what such writing meant. But a little over a hundred years ago a man found out by accident how to read and understand hieroglyphics once again. This is the way he happened to do so. The Nile separates into different streams before it flows into the Mediterranean Sea. These separate streams are called mouths and one of these mouths has been given the name “Rosetta.” One day a man was digging nearby this Rosetta Mouth when he dug up a stone something like a tombstone with several kinds of writing on it. The top writing was in pictures which we now call hieroglyphics, and no one understood what it meant. Below this was written what was supposed to be the same story in the Greek language, and a great many people do understand Greek. All one had to do, therefore, to find out the meaning of the hieroglyphics, was to compare the two writings. It was like reading secret writing when we know what the letters stand for. You may have tried to solve a puzzle in the back of your magazine, and this was just such an interesting puzzle, only there was no one to tell the answer in the next number. The puzzle was not so easy as it sounds, however, for it took a man almost twenty years to solve it. That is a long time for any one to spend in trying to solve a puzzle, isn’t it? But after this “key” to the puzzle was found, men were able to read all of the hieroglyphics in Egypt and so to find out what happened in that country long before Christ was born. This stone is called the Rosetta Stone, from the Rosetta Mouth of the Nile where it was found. It is now in the great British Museum in London and is very famous, because from it we were able to learn so much history which we otherwise would not have known. Egypt was ruled over by a king who was called a Pharaoh. When he died his son became the Pharaoh and so on. All the other people were divided into classes, and the children in each class usually became just what their fathers had been. It was very unusual for an Egyptian to start at the bottom and work up to the top, as a poor boy in this country may do, though once in a great while this happened even in Egypt, as we shall see by and by. The highest class of people were called priests. They were not like priests or ministers of the church nowadays, however, for there was no church at that time. The priests made the religion and rules, which every one had to obey as everybody does the laws of our land. But the priests were not only priests; they were doctors and lawyers and engineers, as well. They were the best-educated class, and they were the only people who knew how to read and write, for it was very difficult, as you might suppose, to learn how to read and write hieroglyphics. The next highest class to the priests were the soldiers, and below these were the lower classes--farmers, shepherds, shopkeepers, merchants, mechanics, and last of all the swineherds. The Egyptians did not worship one God as we do. They believed in hundreds of gods and goddesses, and they had a and Enterprise in Pursuit of Wild Animals.

But have you thought that many of them are families much like yours and mine, traveling uncomfortably in rattly old jalopies while they go from one crop to another, and living crowded in rickety shacks when they stop for work? There have always been wandering farm laborers because so many crops need but a few workers part of the year and a great many at harvest. A two-thousand-acre peach orchard needs only thirty workers most of the year, and one thousand seven hundred at picking time. Lately, though, there have been more migrants than ever. One reason is that while in the past we used to eat fresh peas, beans, strawberries, and the like only in summer, now we want fresh fruits and vegetables all year round. To supply our wants, great quantities of fresh fruit and vegetables must be raised in the warm climates where they will grow. Another reason is that more farm machinery is used now, and one tractor will do as much work as several families of farm laborers. So the extra families have taken to migrating or wandering about the country wherever they hope to find work. A further cause of the wandering is the long drought which turned part of our Southwestern country where there had been good farming into a dry desert that wouldn't grow crops any more. The people from the Dust Bowl, as the district is called, had to migrate, or starve. A great many of them went to the near-by state Of California, which grows much fruit and vegetables. There are perhaps two hundred thousand people migrating to California alone each year. Of course there isn't nearly enough work for them all, and there aren't good living places for those who have work. That means that the children--like you--don't have the rights of young American citizens--like you. A great many of them can't go to school, and are growing up ignorant; and they don't have church, with all it means to us. They don't have proper homes or food, so they haven't good health; and because they are not in their home state or county, they cannot get medical and hospital care. You may think we have nothing to do with them when you sometimes pass a jalopy packed inside with a whole family, from grandma to baby, and outside with bedding and what-not. But we have something to do with them many times a day. Every time we sit down at our table we have something to do with them. Our sugar may come from these children's work; our oranges, too, and our peas, lettuce, melons, berries, cranberries, walnuts . . . ! Every time we put on a cotton dress, we accept something from them. For years no one thought much of trying to help these wanderers. No one seemed to notice the unfairness of letting some children have all the blessings of our country and others have none. By and by, the counties and states and Federal government tried to help the migrant families. In a few places the government has set up comfortable camps and part-time farms such as this story describes. The church has tried to do something, also. About twenty years ago, the Council of Women for Home Missions, made up of groups of women from the different churches, began to make plans for helping. They opened some friendly rooms where they took care of the children who were left alone while their parents worked. The rooms were often no more than a made-over barn, but in these "Christian Centers," as they were called, the children were given cleanliness, food, happiness and the care of a nurse, and were taught something about a loving Father God. The children who worked in the fields and the older people were also helped. From the seven with which a beginning was made, the number of Centers has grown to nearly sixty. There is a great deal more to do in starting more Centers, and in equipping those we have, and we can do part of it. With our church school classes, we can give CleanUp and Kindergarten Kits like Cissy's and Jimmie's and our leaders will tell us other things we can do, such as collecting bedding and clothing and toys and money. Best of all, we can give our friendship to these homeless people. For they're just children like you. When you grow up, perhaps you may help our country become a place where no single child need be homeless. Florence Crannell Means Denver, Colorado ACROSS THE FRUITED PLAIN [Illustration: Beechams in Reo] 1: THE HOUSE OF BEECHAM "Oh, Rose-Ellen!" Grandma called. Rose-Ellen slowly put down her library book and skipped into the kitchen. Grandma peppered the fried potatoes, sliced some wrinkled tomatoes into nests of wilting lettuce, and wiped her dripping face with the hem of her clean gingham apron. The kitchen was even hotter than the half-darkened sitting room where crippled Jimmie sprawled on the floor listlessly wheeling a toy automobile, the pale little baby on a quilt beside him. Grandma squinted through the door at the old Seth Thomas dock in the sitting room. "Half after six! Rose-Ellen, you run down to the shop and tell Grandpa supper's spoiling. Why he's got to hang round that shop till supper's spoilt when he could fix up all the shoes he's got in two-three hours, I don't understand. 'Twould be different if he had anything to do. . . ." Rose-Ellen said, "O.K., Gramma!" and ran through the hall. She'd rather get away before Grandma talked any more about the shop. Day after day she had heard about it. Grandma talked to her, though she was only ten, because she and Grandma were the only women in the family, since last winter when Mother died. As Rose-Ellen let the front door slam behind her, she saw Daddy coming slowly up the street. The way his broad shoulders drooped and the way he took off his hat and pushed back his thick, dark hair told her as plainly as words that he hadn't found work that day. Even though you were a child, you got so tired--so tired--of the grown folks' worrying about where the next quart of milk would come from. So Rose-Ellen patted him on the arm as they passed, saying, "Hi, Daddy, I'm after Grampa!" and hop-skipped on toward the old cobbler shop. Before Rose-Ellen was born, when Daddy was a boy, even, Grandpa had had his shop at that corner of the city street. There he was, standing behind the counter in the shadowy shop, his shoulders drooping like Daddy's. He was a big, kind-looking old man, his gray hair waving round a bald dome, his eyes bright blue. He was looking at a newspaper. It was a crumpled old paper that had been wrapped around someone's shoes; the Beechams didn't spend pennies for newspapers nowadays. The long brushes were quiet from their whirling. On the rack of finished shoes two pairs awaited their owners; on the other rack were a few that had evidently just come in. Yet Grandpa looked as tired as if he had mended a hundred pairs. He looked up when the bell tinkled. "Oh, Ellen-girl! Anything wrong?" "Only Gramma says please come to supper. Everything's getting spoiled." Grandpa glanced at his old clock. It said half-past five. "I keep tinkering with it, but it's seen its best days. Like me." He took off his denim apron, rolled down his sleeves, put on his hat and coat, and locked the door behind them. But not before he had looked wistfully around the little place, with its smell of beeswax, leather and dye, where he had worked so long. Its walls were papered with his favorite calendars: country scenes that reminded him of his farm boyhood; roly-poly babies in bathtubs; a pretty girl who looked, he said, like Grandma--a funny idea to Rose-Ellen. Patched linoleum, doorstep hollowed by thousands of feet--Grandpa looked at everything as if it were new and bright, and as if he loved it. Starting home, he took Rose-Ellen's small damp hand in his big damp one. The sun blinded them as they walked westward, and the heat struck at them fiercely from pavement and wall, as if it were fighting them. Rose-Ellen was strong and didn't mind. She held her head straight to make her thick brown curls hit against her backbone. She knew she was pretty, with her round face and dark-lashed hazel eyes; and that nobody would think her starchy short pink dress was old, because Grandma had mended it so nicely. Grandma had darned the short socks that turned down to her stout slippers, too; and Grandpa had mended the slippers till the tops would hardly hold another pair of soles. "Hi, Rosie!" called Julie Albi, who lived next door. "C'm'out and play after supper?" "Next door" was the right way to say it. This Philadelphia street was like two block-long houses, facing each other across a strip of pavement, each with many pairs of twin front doors, each pair with two scrubbed stone steps down to the sidewalk, and two bay windows bulging out upstairs, so that they seemed nearly to touch the ones across the narrow street. Rose-Ellen and Julie shared twin doors and steps; and inside only a thin wall separated them. At the door Dick overtook Grandpa and Rose-Ellen. Dick was twelve. Sometimes Rose-Ellen considered him nothing but a nuisance, and sometimes she was proud of his tallness, his curly fair hair and bright blue eyes. He dashed in ahead when Grandpa turned the key, but Grandpa lingered. Rose-Ellen said, "Hurry, Grampa, everything's getting cold." But she understood. He was thinking that their dear old house was no longer theirs. Something strange had happened to it, called "sold for taxes," and they were allowed to live in it only this summer. Grandma blamed the shop. It had brought in the money to buy the house in the first place and had kept it up until a few years ago. It had put Daddy through a year in college. Now it was failing. Once, it seemed, people bought good shoes and had them mended many times. Then came days when many people were poor. They had to buy shoes too cheap to be mended; so when the soles wore out, the people threw the shoes away and bought more cheap ones. No longer were Grandpa's shoe racks crowded. No longer was there money even for taxes. All Grandpa took in was barely enough for food and shop rent. But what else besides mending shoes and farming did he know how to do? And who would hire an old man when jobs were so few? Even young Daddy had lost his job as a photograph finisher, and had brought his wife and three children home to live with Grandpa and Grandma. There Baby Sally was born; and there, before the baby was a month old, Mother had died. Soon after, the old house had been sold for taxes. Grandma went about her work with the strong lines of her square face fixed in sadness. She was forever begging Grandpa to give up the shop, but Grandpa smashed his fist down on the table and said it was like giving up his life. . . . And day after day Daddy hunted work and was cross because he could find none. For Dick and Rose-Ellen the summer had not been very different from usual. Dick blacked boots on Saturdays to earn a few dimes; Rose-Ellen helped Grandma with the "chores." They had long hours of play besides. But the hot summer had been hard for nine-year-old Jimmie and the baby. They drooped like flowers in baked ground. Since Jimmie's infantile paralysis, three years before, he had been able to walk very little, and school had seemed out of the question. Unable to read or to run and play, he had a dull time. Grandpa and Rose-Ellen went through the clean, shabby hall to the kitchen, where Grandma was rocking in the old rocker, Sally whimpering on her lap. "Well, for the land's sakes," said Grandma, "did you make up your mind to come home at last? Mind Baby, Rose-Ellen, while I dish up." After supper, Daddy sat hopelessly studying the "Help Wanted" column in last Sunday's paper, borrowed from the Albis. Jimmie looked at the funnies, and Grandma and Rose-Ellen did the dishes. Julie Albi, who had come to play, sat waiting with heels hooked over a chair-rung. The shabby kitchen was pleasant, with rag rugs on the painted floor and crisp, worn curtains. The table and chairs were cream-color, and the table wore an embroidered flour-sack cover. Grandpa pottered with a loose door-latch until Grandma wrung the suds from her hands and cried fiercely, "What's the use doing such things, Grampa? You know good and well we can't stay on here. Everything's being taken away from us, even our children. . . ." [Illustration: Grandpa pottering] "Miss Piper come to see you, too?" Grandpa groaned. "Taken away? Us?" gasped Rose-Ellen. "What's all this?" Daddy demanded. He stood in the doorway staring at Grandpa and Grandma, and his bright dark eyes looked almost as unbelieving as they had when Mother slipped away from him. "You can't mean they want to take away our children?" Dick came to the door with half of Jimmie's funnies, his mouth open; and Jimmie hobbled in, bent almost double, thin hand on crippled knee. Julie slipped politely away. Then the news came out. The woman from the "Family Society" had called that day and had advised Grandma to put the children into a Home. When Grandma would not listen, the woman went on to the shop and talked with Grandpa. "Her telling us they wasn't getting enough milk and vegetables!" Grandma scolded, wiping her eyes with one hand and smoothing back Rose-Ellen's curls with the other. "Saying Jimmie'd ought to be where he'd get sunshine without roasting. Good as telling me we don't know how to raise children, and her without a young-one to her name." Grandpa blew his nose. "Well, it takes money to give the kids the vittles they ought to have." "I won't go away from my own house!" howled Jimmie. Rose-Ellen and Dick blinked at each other. It was one thing to scrap a little and quite another to be entirely apart. And the baby. . . . "Would Miss Piper take . . . Sally?" Rose-Ellen quavered. Grandma nodded, lips tight. "They shan't!" Rose-Ellen whispered. "Nonsense!" Daddy said hoarsely, his hands tightening on Jimmie's shoulder and Rose-Ellen's. "It's better for families to stick together, even if they don't get everything they need. Ma, you think it's better, don't you?" He looked anxiously at his parents and they looked pityingly at him, as if he were a boy again, and before they knew it the whole family were crying together, Grandpa and Daddy pretending they had colds. Then came a knock at the door, and Grandma mopped her eyes with her apron and answered. Julie's mother stood there, a comfortable brown woman with shining black hair and gold earrings, the youngest Albi enthroned on her arm. Mrs. Albi's eyebrows had risen to the middle of her forehead, and she patted Grandma's shoulder plumply. [Illustration: Mrs. Albi] "Now, now, now, now!" she comforted in a big voice. "All will be well, praise God. Julie, she tell me. All will be well." "How on earth can all be well?" Grandma protested. "I don't see no prospects." "This summer as you know," said Mrs. Albi, "we went into Jersey. For two months we all pick the berries. Enough we earn to put-it food into our mouth. And the keeds! They go white and skinny, and they come home, like you see it, brown and fat." Her voice rose and she waved the baby dramatically. "Not so good the houses, I would not lie to you. But we make like we have the peekaneeka. By night the cool fresh air blow on us and by day the warm fresh air. And vegetables and fruit so cheap, so cheap." "But what good will that do us, Mis' Albi?" Grandma asked flatly. "It's close onto September and berries is out." "The cranberry bog!" Mrs. Albi shouted triumphantly. "Only today the _padrone_, he come to my people asking who will pick the cranberry. And that Jersey air, it will bring the fat and the red to these Jimmie's cheeks and to the _bambina_'s!" Mrs. Albi wheezed as she ran out of breath. The Beechams stared at her. Many Italians and Americans went to the farms to pick berries and beans. The Beechams had never thought of doing so, since Grandpa had his cobbling and Daddy his photograph finishing. "Well, why shouldn't we?" Daddy fired the question into the stillness. "But school?" asked Rose-Ellen, who liked school. Mrs. Albi waved a work-worn palm. "You smart, Rosie. You ketch up all right." "That's okeydoke with me!" Dick exclaimed, yanking his sister's curls. "You can have your old school." Sally woke with a cry like a kitten's mew and Rose-Ellen lugged her out, balanced on her hip. Mrs. Albi's Michael was the same age, but he would have made two of Sally. Above Sally's small white face her pale hair stood up thinly; her big gray eyes and little pale mouth were solemn. "Why," Grandma said doubtfully, "we . . . why, if Grandpa would give up his shop--just for the cranberry season. We got no place else to go." Grandpa sighed. "Looks like the shop's give me up already. We could think about it." "All together!" whooped Dick. "And not any school!" "Now, hold your horses," Grandma cautioned. "Beechams don't run off nobody knows where, without anyway sleeping over it." But though they "slept over" the problem and talked it over as hard as they could, going to the cranberry bogs was the best answer they could find for the difficulty. It seemed the only way for them to stay together. "Something will surely turn up in a month or two," Daddy said. "And without my kids"--he spread his big hands--"I haven't a thing to show for my thirty-two years." "The thing is," Grandpa summed it up, "when we get out of this house we've got to pay rent, and I'm not making enough for rent and food, too. No place to live, or else nothing to eat." Finally it was decided that they should go. Now there was much to do. They set aside a few of their most precious belongings to be stored, like Grandma's grandma's painted dower chest, full of treasures, and Grandpa's tall desk and Rose-Ellen's dearest doll. Next they chose the things they must use during their stay in Jersey. Finally they called in the second-hand man around the corner to buy the things that were left. Poor Grandma! She clenched her hands under her patched apron when the man shoved her beloved furniture around and glanced contemptuously at the clean old sewing machine that had made them so many nice clothes. "One dollar for the machine, lady." Rose-Ellen tucked her hand into Grandma's as they looked at the few boxes and pieces of furniture they were leaving behind, standing on stilts in Mrs. Albi's basement to keep dry. "It's so funny," Rose-Ellen stammered; "almost as if that was all that was left of our home." "Funny as a tombstone," said Grandma. Then she went and grabbed the old Seth Thomas clock and hugged it to her. "This seems the livingest thing. It goes where I go." At last, everything was disposed of, and the padrone's agent's big truck pulled up to their curb. Two feather beds, a trunk, pots, pans, dishes and the Beechams were piled into the space left by some twenty-five other people. The truck roared away, with the neighbors shouting good-by from steps and windows. Grandma kept her eyes straight ahead so as not to see her house again. Grandpa shifted Jimmie around to make his lame leg more comfortable, just as they passed the cobbler's shop with "TO LET" in the window. Grandpa did not lift his eyes. "I hope Mrs. Albi will sprinkle them Bronze Beauty chrysanthemums so they won't all die off," Grandma said in a choked voice. 2: THE CRANBERRY BOG The truck rumbled through clustering cities, green country and white villages. All the children stared in fascination until Jimmie grew too tired and huddled down against Grandma's knees, whining because he ached and the sun was hot and the truck was crowded. Grandpa kept pointing out new things-holly trees; muskrat houses rising in small stick-stacks from the ponds; farms that made their own rain, with rows and rows of pipes running along six feet in air, to shower water on the vegetables below. It was late afternoon, and dark because of the clouds, when the truck reached the bogs. These bogs weren't at all what Rose-Ellen and Dick had expected, but only wet-looking fields of low bushes. There was no chance to look at them now, for everyone was hurrying to get settled. The _padrone_ led them to a one-room shed built of rough boards and helped dump their belongings inside. Grandma stood at the door, hands on hips, and said, "Well, good land of love! If anybody'd told me I'd live in a shack!" Rose-Ellen danced around her, shrieking joyously, "Peekaneeka, Gramma! Peekaneeka!" Grandma's face creased in an unwilling smile and she said, "You'll get enough peekaneeka before you're done, or I miss my guess." "Got here just in time, just in time!" chanted Dick and Rose-Ellen, as a sudden storm pounded the roof with rain and split the air with thunder and lightning. "My land!" cried Grandma. "S'pose this roof will leak on the baby and Seth Thomas?" For an hour the Beechams dashed around setting up campkeeping. For supper they finished the enormous lunch Grandma had brought. After that came bedtime. Rose-Ellen lay across the foot of Grandpa and Grandma's goosefeather bed, spread on the floor. After the rain stopped, fresh air flowed through the light walls. Cranberry-picking did not start next morning till ground and bushes had dried a little. Grandpa and Daddy had time first to knock together stools and a table, and to find on a dumpheap a little old stove, which they propped up and mended so Grandma could cook on it. "The land's sakes," Grandma grumbled, "a hobo contraption like that!" While they washed the breakfast dishes and straightened the one room, the grown-ups discussed whether the children should work in the bog. Their Italian neighbor in the next shack had said, "No can maka da living unless da keeds dey work, too. Dey can work. My youngest, he four year and he work good." "Likely we could take Baby along, and Jimmie could watch her while we pick," Grandma said dubiously. "But my fingers are all thumbs when I've got them children on my mind.--Somebody's at the door." A tall young girl with short yellow curls stood tapping at the open door. Grandma looked at her approvingly, her blouse was so crisply white. "Good morning," said the girl. "I've come from the Center, where we have a day nursery for the little folks." She smiled down at Jimmie and Sally. "Wouldn't you like us to take care of yours while the grown-ups are working?" She made the older children feel grown-up by the polite way she looked at them. "I've heard of the Centers," Grandma said, leaning on her broom. "But I never did get much notion what you did with the young-ones there." "Well, all sorts of things," said the girl. "They sing and make things and learn Bible verses. And in the afternoon they have a nap-time. It's loads of fun for them." "They take their lunch along?" Grandma inquired. "Oh, no! A good hot lunch is part of the program." "But, then, how much does it cost?" "A nickel apiece a day." "Come, come, young lady, that don't make sense," Grandpa objected. "You'd lose money lickety-split." The girl laughed. "We aren't doing it for money. We get money and supplies from groups of women in all the different churches. The owner of the bog helps, too. But we'll have to hurry, or your row boss will be tooting his whistle." Her eyes were admiring children and shack as she talked. Though not like Grandma's lost house, this camp was already clean and orderly. [Illustration: On the way to the Center] So the three went to the Center, the girl carrying Sally, and Jimmie hobbling along in sulky silence. Jimmie had stayed so much at home that he didn't know how to behave with strangers. Because he didn't want anyone to guess that he was bashful, he frowned fiercely. Because he didn't want anyone to think him "sissy," he had his wavy hair clipped till his head looked like a golf ball. He was a queer, unhappy boy. He was unhappier when they reached the big, bright, shabby house that was the Center. Could it be safe to let Sally mingle with the ragged, dirty children who were flocking in, he wondered? His anxiety soon vanished. The babies were bathed and the bigger children sent to rows of wash-basins. In a jiffy, clean babies lay taking their bottles in clean baskets and clean children were dressed in clean play-suits. Besides the yellow-haired girl (her name was Miss Abbott, but Jimmie never called her anything but "Her" and "She"), there were two girls and an older woman, all busy. When clean-up time was past and the babies asleep, the older ones had a worship service with songs and stories. After worship came play. Outdoors were sandpiles and swings. Indoors were books and games. Jimmie longed for storybooks and reading class; but how could he tell Her that he was nine years old and couldn't read? He huddled in a corner, scowling, and turned pages as if he were reading. Meanwhile the rest of the family had answered the whistle of the row boss, and were being introduced to the cranberries. Dick and Rose-Ellen were excited and happy, for it was the first fruit they had ever picked. Though the wet bushes gave them shower baths, the sun soon dried them. Since the ground was deep in mud, they had gone barefoot, on the advice of Pauline Isabel, the colored girl in a neighboring shack. The cool mud squshed up between their toes and plastered their legs pleasantly. The grown folks had been given wooden hands for picking--scoops with finger-like cleats! At first they were awkward at stripping the branches, but soon the berries began to drop briskly into the scoops. The children, who could get at the lower branches more easily, picked by hand; and before noon all the Beecham fingers were sore from the prickly stems and leaves. In the afternoon they had less trouble, for an Italian family near by showed them how to wrap their fingers with adhesive tape. But picking wasn't play. The Beechams trudged back to their shack that night, sunburned and dirty and too stiff to straighten their backs, longing for nothing but to drop down on their beds. "Good land of love!" Grandma scolded. "Lie down all dirty on my clean beds? I hope I ain't raised me up a mess of pigs. You young-ones, you fetch a pail of water from the pump, and we'll see how clean we can get. My land, what wouldn't I give for a bathtub and a sink! And a gas stove!" "Peekaneeka, Gramma!" Dick reminded her, squeezing her. "Picnic my foot! I'm too old for such goings-on." [Illustration: Lying down on the beds] Though Grandma's rheumatism had doubled her up like a jack-knife, she scrubbed herself with energy and soon had potatoes boiling, pork sizzling, and tea brewing on the rickety stove. Daddy brought Jimmie and Sally from the Center. After supper they felt a little better. Jimmie wouldn't tell about the Center, but from inside his blouse he hauled a red oilcloth bag, and emptied it out on the table. There were scissors, crayons, paste, pencil, and squares of colored paper. And there was a note which Jimmie smoothed out and handed to Daddy. "From Jimmie Brown," he read, "Bethel Church, Cleveland." "We-we were s'posed to write thank-you letters!" Jimmie burst out miserably. "She sat us all down to a table and gave us pens and paper." "And what did you do, Son?" Daddy asked, smoothing the bristly little head. "I said could I take mine home," Jimmie mumbled, fishing a tight-folded sheet of paper from his pocket. "I'll write it for you," Rose-Ellen offered. She sat down and began the letter, with Jimmie telling her what he wanted to say. "But the real honest thing to do will be to tell her you didn't write it yourself," Grandma said pityingly. "They have stories and games at night," Jimmie said, changing the subject. "She said to bring Dick and Rose-Ellen." Dick and Rose-Ellen were too tired for stories and games that night. They tumbled into bed as soon as supper was done, and had to be dragged awake for breakfast. Not till a week's picking had hardened their muscles did they go to the Center. When they did go--Jimmie limping along with his clipped head tucked sulkily between his shoulders as if he were not really proud to take them-they found the place alive with fun. Besides the three girls and the woman, there was a young man from a near-by university. He was organizing ping-pong games and indoor baseball for the boys and girls and even volleyball for some grown men who had come. Everyone was busy and everyone happy. "It's slick here, some ways," Dick said that night. "For a few weeks," Daddy agreed. "If it wasn't for the misery in my back, it wouldn't be bad," Grandma murmured. "But an old body'd rather settle down in her own place. Who'd ever've thought I'd leave my solid oak dining set after I was sixty! But I'd like the country fine if we had a real house to live in." "I'm learning to do spatter prints--for Christmas," said Rose-Ellen, brushing her hair before going to bed. "Jimmie, why on earth don't you take this chance to learn reading?" Daddy coaxed. "Daddy, you won't tell Her I can't read?" Jimmie begged. Yet, as October passed, something happened to change Jimmie's mind. As October passed, too, the Beechams grew skillful at picking. They couldn't earn much, for it took a lot of cranberries to fill a peck measure-two gallons-especially this year, when the berries were small; and the pickers got only fifteen cents a peck. The bogs had to be flooded every night to keep the fruit from freezing; so every morning the mud was icy and so were the shower-baths from the wet bushes. But except for Grandma, they didn't find it hard work now. "It's sure bad on the rheumatiz," said Grandma one morning, as she bent stiffly to wash clothes in the tub that had been filled and heated with such effort. "If we was home, we'd be lighting little kindling fires in the furnace night and morning. And hot water just by lighting the gas! Land, I never knew my own luck." "But I like it here!" Jimmie burst out eagerly. "Do you know something? I'm going to learn to read! I colored my pictures the neatest of anyone in the class, and She put them all on the wall. So then I didn't mind telling her how I never learned to read and write and how Rose-Ellen wrote my letter to Jimmie Brown in Cleveland." He beamed so proudly that Grandpa, wringing a sheet for Grandma, looked sorrowfully at him over his glasses. "It's a pity you didn't tell her sooner, young-one," he said. "The cranberries will be over in a few more days, and we'll be going back." "Back to Philadelphia?" Rose-Ellen demanded. "Where? Not to a Home? I won't! I'd rather go on and shuck oysters like Pauline Isabel and her folks. I'd rather go on where they're cutting marsh hay. I'd rather--" "Well, now," Grandpa's words were slow, "what about it, kids? What about it, Grandma? Do we go back to the city and-and part company till times are better? Or go on into oysters together?" The tears stole down Jimmie's cheeks, but he didn't say anything. Daddy didn't say anything, either. He picked Sally up and hugged her so hard that she grunted and then put her tiny hands on his cheeks and peered into his eyes, chirping at him like a little bird. "I calculate we'll go on into oysters," said Grandpa. 3: SHUCKING OYSTERS This picnic way of living had one advantage; it made moving easy. One day the Beechams were picking; the next day they had joined with two other families and hired a truck to take them and their belongings to Oystershell, on the inlet of the bay near by. Pauline Isabel's family were going to a Negro oystershucking village almost in sight of Oystershell. "It's sure nice there!" Pauline assured them happily. "I belong to a girls' club that meets every day after school; in the Meth'dis' church. We got a sure good school, too, good as any white school, up the road a piece." The Beechams said good-by to Pauline's family, who had become their friends. Then they said good-by to Miss Abbott. That was hard for Jimmie. He butted his shaven little head against Her and then limped away as fast as he could. The ride to Oystershell was exciting. Autumn had changed the look of the land. "God has taken all the red and yellow he's got, and just splashed it on in gobs," said Rose-Ellen as they traveled toward the seashore. "What I like," Dick broke in, "is to see the men getting in the salt hay with their horses on sleds." The marshes were too soft to hold up anything so small as a hoof, so when farmers used horses there, they fastened broad wooden shoes on the horses' feet. Nowadays, though, horses were giving place to tractors. The air had an increasingly queer smell, like iodized salt in boiling potatoes. The Beechams were nearing the salt-water inlets of the bay, where the tides rose and fell like the ocean-of which the inlets were part. The tide was high when they drove down from Phillipsville to the settlement of Oystershell. The rows of wooden houses, the oyster-sheds and the company store seemed to be wading on stilts, and most people wore rubber boots. Grandma said, "If the bog was bad for my rheumatiz, what's this going to be?" A man showed the Beechams a vacant house in the long rows. "Not much to look at," he acknowledged, "but the rent ain't much, either. The roofs are tight and a few have running water, case you want it bad enough to pay extra." "To think a rusty pipe and one faucet in my kitchen would ever be a luxury!" Grandma muttered. "But, my land, even the humpy wall-paper looks good now." It was gay, clean paper, though pasted directly on the boards. The house had a kitchen-dining-sitting room and one bedroom, with walls so thin they let through every word of the next-door radio. "That's going to be a peekaneeka, sure," Grandma said grimly. Children were not allowed to work in the oysters, but Grandma was going to try. The children could tell she was nervous about it, by the way her foot jerked up and down when she gave Sally her bottle that night; but she said she expected she wasn't too dumb to do what other folks could. The children were still asleep when the grown-ups went to work in the six o'clock darkness of that November Saturday. When they woke, mush simmered on the cookstove and a bottle of milk stood on the table. It took time to feed Sally and wash dishes and make beds; and then Dick and Rose-Ellen ran over to the nearest long oyster-house and peeked through a hole in the wall. Down each side, raised above the fishy wet floor, ran a row of booths, each with a desk and step, made of rough boards. On each step stood a man or woman, in boots and heavy clothes, facing the desk. Only instead of pen and paper, these people had buckets, oysters, knives. As fast as they could, they were opening the big, horny oyster shells and emptying the oysters into the buckets. Next time, Dick stayed with Sally, and Rose-Ellen and Jimmie peeked. They were startled when a big hand dropped on each of their heads. "You kids skedaddle," ordered a big man. "If you want to see things, come back at four." By four o'clock the grown folks were home, tired and smelling of fish; Dick and Rose-Ellen were prancing on tiptoe to go, and even Jimmie was ready. "This is what he is like," said Rose-Ellen, "the man who said we could." She stuck in her chin and threw out her chest and tried to stride. "That's the Big Boss, all right," Daddy said, laughing. "Guess it's O.K. But mind your _p_'s and _q_'s." "And stick together. Specially in a strange place." Grandma wearily picked up the baby. The Big Boss saw them as soon as they tiptoed into the oyster-house. "Ez," he called, "here's some nice kids. Show 'em around, will you?" Ez was opening clams with a penknife, and spilling them into his mouth. "Want some?" he asked. The children shook their heads vigorously. He closed his knife and dropped it into his pocket. "Well, now first you want to see the dredges come in from the bay." He took them through the open front of the shed to the docks outside. The boats had gone out at three o'clock in the morning, he said, in the deep dark. They were coming in now heavily, loaded high with horny oysters, and Ez pointed out the rake-set iron nets with which the shellfish were dragged from their beds. "Got 'em out of bed good and early!" "I'd hate to have to eat 'em all," Jimmie said suddenly in his husky little voice. Everyone laughed, for the big rough shells were traveling into the oyster-house by thousands, on moving belts. Some shells looked as if they were carrying sponges in their mouths, but Ez said it was a kind of moss that grew there. Already the pile of unopened oysters in the shed was higher than a man. The shuckers needed a million to work on next day, Ez said. [Illustration: Watching the dredges] When the children had watched awhile, and the boatmen had asked their names, and how old they were and where they came from, Ez took them inside the shed to show them the handling of the newly shucked oysters. First the oysters were dumped into something that looked like Mrs. Albi's electric washer, and washed and washed. Then they were emptied into a flume, a narrow trough along which they were swept into bright cans that held almost a gallon each. The cans were stored in ice-packed barrels, and early next morning would go out in trains and trucks to all parts of the country. "How many pearls have they found in all these oysters?" Dick demanded in a businesslike voice. "Not any!" Ez said. "Why can't you eat oysters in months that don't have R in them?" asked Rose-Ellen. "You could, if there wasn't a law against selling them. It's only a notion, like not turning your dress if you put it on wrong side out. Summer's when oysters lay eggs. You don't stop eating hens because they lay eggs, do you? But now scram, kids. I got work to do." They left, skipping past the mountains of empty shells outside. Next day the children went to church school alone. The grown folks were too tired. And on Monday Dick and Rose-Ellen went up the road to the school in the little village. It was strange to be in school again, and with new schoolmates and teachers and even new books, since this was a different state. Rose-Ellen's grade, the fifth, had got farther in long division than her class at home, and she couldn't understand what they were doing. Dick had trouble, too, for the seventh grade was well started on United States history, and he couldn't catch up. But that was not the worst of it. The two children could not seem to fit in with their schoolmates. The village girls gathered in groups by themselves and acted as if the oyster-shuckers' children were not there at all; and the boys did not give Dick even a chance to show what a good pitcher he was. Both Rose-Ellen and Dick had been leaders in the city school, and now they felt so lonesome that Rose-Ellen often cried when she got home. It was too long a walk for Jimmie, who begged not to go anyway. Besides, he was needed at home to mind Sally. Of course the grown folks wanted to earn all they could. The pay was thirty cents a gallon; and just as it took a lot of cranberries to make a peck, it took a lot of these middle-sized oysters to make a gallon. To keep the oysters fresh, the sheds were left so cold that the workers must often dip their numb hands into pails of hot water. All this was hard on Grandma's rheumatism; but painful as the work was, she did not give it up until something happened that forced her to. It was late November, and the fire in the shack must be kept going all day to make the rooms warm enough for Sally. She was creeping now, and during the long hours when the grown folks were working and the older children at school, she had to stay in a chair with a gate across the front which her father had fixed out of an old kitchen armchair. Grandma cushioned it with rags, but it grew hard and tiresome, and sometimes Jimmie could not keep her contented there. One day Sally cried until he wriggled her out of her nest and spread a quilt for her in a corner of the room as Grandma did. There he sat, fencing her in with his legs while he drew pictures of oyster-houses. He was so busy drawing roofs that he had forgot all about Sally until he was startled by her scream. He jerked around in terror. Sally had clambered over the fence of his legs and crept under the stove after her ball. Perhaps a spark had snapped through the half-open slide in the stove door; however it had happened, the flames were running up her little cotton dress. Poor Baby Sally! Jimmie had never felt so helpless. Hardly knowing why he did it, he dragged the wool quilt off Grandma's bed and scooted across the floor in a flash. While Sally screamed with fright, he wrapped the thick folds tightly around her and hugged her close. [Illustration: Jimmie saving Sally] When the grown folks came from work, just ahead of the school children, they found Jimmie and Sally white and shaky but safe. The woolen quilt had smothered out the flames before Sally was hurt at all; and Jimmie had only a pair of blistered hands. "If I hadn't put a wool petticoat on her, and wool stockings," Grandma kept saying, while she sat and rocked the whimpering baby. "And if our Jimmie hadn't been so smart as to think of the bedclothes. . . . "Not all children have been so lucky," Daddy said in a shaky voice, crouching beside Grandma and touching Sally's downy head. "But I hadn't ought to have left her with poor Jimmie," Grandma mourned. "If only they had a Center, like at the bogs. I don't believe I can bear it to stay here any longer after this. Maybe we best go back to the city and put them in a Home." Daddy objected. "We'll not leave the kids alone again, of course; but we're making a fair living and the Boss says there'll be work through April, and then Pa and I can go out and plant seed oysters if we want." "Where's the good of a fair living if it's the death of you?" Grandma's tone was tart. "No, sir, I ain't going to stay, tied in bowknots with rheumatiz, and these poor young-ones. . . ." Grandpa made a last effort, though he knew it was of little use when Grandma was set. "I bet we could go to work on one of these truck farms, come summer." Grandma only rocked her straight chair, jerking one foot up and down. "One of these _padrones_," Daddy said slowly, "is trying to get families to work in Florida. In winter fruits." Grandma brightened. "Floridy might do us a sight of good, and I always did hanker after palm trees. But how could we get there?" "They send you down in a truck," said Daddy. "Charge you so much a head and feed and lodge you into the bargain. I figure we've got just about enough to make it." South into summer! "That really would be a peekaneeka!" crowed Rose-Ellen. 4: PEEKANEEKA? That trip to Florida surprised the Beechams, but not happily. First, the driver shook his head at featherbeds, dishes, trunk. "I take three grown folks, three kids, one baby, twenty-eight dollars," he growled. "No furniture." Argument did no good. Hastily the family sorted out their most needed clothing and made it into small bundles. The driver scowled at even those. "My featherbeds!" cried Grandma, weeping for once. Hurriedly she sold the beds for a dollar to her next-door neighbor. The clock she would not leave and it took turns with the baby sitting on grown-up laps. At each stop the springless truck seats were crowded tighter with people, till there was hardly room for the passengers' feet. The crowding did help warm the unheated truck; but Grandma's face grew gray with pain as cold and cramp made her "rheumatiz tune up." And there was no place at all to take care of a baby. When they had traveled two hours they wondered how they could bear thirteen hundred miles, cold, aching, wedged motionless. All they could look forward to was lunchtime, when they could stretch themselves and ease their gnawing stomachs; but the sun climbed high and the truck still banged along without stopping. The children could hear a man in front angrily asking the driver, "When we get-it--the dinner?" The driver faced ahead as if he were deaf. "When we get-it--the grub?" roared the man, pounding the driver's shoulder. "If we stop once an hour, we don't get there in time for your jobs," the driver growled, and drove on. Not till dark did they stop to eat. Grandpa, clambering down stiffly, had to lift Grandma and Sally out. Daddy took Jimmie, sobbing with weariness. Dick and Rose-Ellen tumbled out, feet asleep and bodies aching. When they stumbled into the roadside hamburger stand, the lights blurred before their eyes, and the hot steamy air with its cooking smells made Rose-Ellen so dizzy that she could hardly eat the hamburger and potato chips and coffee slammed down before her on the sloppy counter. Jimmie went to sleep with his head in his plate and had to be wakened to finish. Still, the food did help them, and when they were wedged into their seats again, they could begin to look forward to the night's rest. Grandpa said likely they wouldn't drive much after ten, and Grandma said, "Land of love, ten? Does he think a body's made of leather?" On and on they went, toppling sleepily against each other, aching so hard that the ache wakened them, hearing dimly the same angry man arguing with the driver. "When we stop to sleep, hah? I ask you, when we stop to sleep?" They didn't stop at all. Rose-Ellen was forever wishing she could wake up enough to pull up the extra quilt which always used to be neatly rolled at the foot of her bed. Once, through uneasy dreams, she felt Daddy shaking her gently, and while she tried to pull away and back into sleep, Grandpa's determinedly cheerful voice said, "Always did want to see Washington, D. C., and here we are. Look quick and you'll see the United States Capitol." From the rumbling truck, Rose-Ellen and Dick focused sleep-blurred eyes with a mighty effort and saw the great dome and spreading wings, flooded with light. "Puts me in mind of a mother eagle brooding her young," Grandpa muttered. "Land of love, enough sight of them eaglets is out from under her wings, finding slim pickin's," Grandma snapped. "Looks like white wax candles." Rose-Ellen yawned widely and went to sleep again. When gray morning dawned, she did not know which was worse-the sleepiness or the hunger. The angry man demanded over and over, "When we stop for breakfast?" They didn't stop. Grandma had canned milk and boiled water along, and with all the Beechams working together, they got the baby's bottles filled. Poor Sally couldn't understand the cold milk, but she was so hungry she finally drank it, staring reproachfully at her bottle. Not till he had engine trouble did the driver halt. Fortunately the garage where he stopped had candy and pop for sale. Grandpa had his family choose each a chocolate bar and a bottle. He wanted to get more, for fear they would not stop for the noon meal, but in five minutes all the supplies were sold. Rose-Ellen tried to make her chocolate almond bar last; she chewed every bite till it slid down her throat; and then, alas, she was so sick that it didn't stay down. Grandpa and Daddy talked with others about making the driver give them rest and food; but there was nothing they could do: the padrone, back in Philadelphia, already had their money for the trip. The children walked about while they waited. It was not cold, but the dampness chilled them. It was queer country, the highway running between swamps of black water, where gray trees stood veiled in gray moss. Gray cabins sat every-which-way in the clearing, heavy shutters swinging at their glassless windows. A pale, thin girl talked to Rose-Ellen. She was Polish, and her name was Rose, too. When Rose-Ellen asked her if she had ever heard of such a dreadful trip, she shrugged and said she was used to going without sleep. Last year, in asparagus, she and her parents and two brothers cared for twenty-two acres, and when it grew hot "dat grass, oooop she go and we work all night for git ahead of her." Asparagus, even Rose-Ellen knew could grow past using in a day. The Polish Rose said that they got up at four in the morning and were in the fields at half-past; and sometimes worked till near midnight. "Mornings," she said, "I think I die, so bad I want the sleep. And then the boss, he no give us half our wages. Now most a year it has been." Curiously Rose-Ellen asked her about school. "No money, no time, no clo'es," said Polish Rose. The truck-driver shouted to his people to pile in and the truck went on. By noon the Beechams were seeing their first palm trees and winter flowers. Grandpa and Daddy tried to tell the children about the things they were passing, but the children were too sleepy and sickish to care. Grandma's mouth was a thin line of pain and the baby wailed until people looked around crossly, though there were other crying babies. The truck reached its destination late on the second evening and piled out its passengers at a grapefruit camp. Rose-Ellen had been picturing a village of huts like those at the bogs, or bright-papered shacks like the oystershuckers'. Though the featherbeds were gone, it would be delicious to lie on the floor, uncrowded, and sheltered from the night. But no such shelter awaited them. Instead, they were pointed to a sort of hobo camp with lights glimmering through torn canvas. A heavy odor scented the darkness. Grandpa said, "They can't expect decent folks . . . !" Grandma said, "We've got to stretch out somewheres. Even under a tree. This baby. . . ." Sally was crying a miserable little cry, and an Italian woman who reminded Rose-Ellen of Mrs. Albi peered out of a patched tent and said, "Iss a _bambina_! Oooh, the little so-white _bambina_! Look you here, quick! The people next door have leave these tent. You move in before some other bodies." "These tent" was a top and three walls of dirty canvas. "If you'd told me a Beecham would lay down in a filthy place like this. . . ." Grandma declared. Rose-Ellen did not hear the end of the sentence. She was asleep on the earth floor. Next day when the men and Dick were hired to pick grapefruit, Grandpa asked the boss about better living quarters. "He said there wasn't any," Grandpa reported later. "My land of love, you mean we've got to stay here?" Grandma groaned. Grimly she set to work. The Italian neighbor had brought her a pot of stew and some coffee, but now Grandma and Rose-Ellen must go to the store for provisions. They brushed their clothes, all wrinkles from the long trip, and demanding the iron Grandma did not have. They combed their hair and washed. They set out, leaving the baby with Jimmie. "Shall I send these?" the grocer asked respectfully, when they had given their order. "You're new here, aren't you?" Mussed as they were, the Beechams still looked respectable. Grandma flushed. She hated to have anyone see that flapping canvas room, but the heap of supplies was heavy. "Please. We're working in the grapefruit," she said. The grocer's face lost its smile. "Oh, we don't deliver to the camps," he snapped. "And it's strictly cash." Grandma handed him the coins, and she and Rose-Ellen silently piled their purchases into the tub they had bought. They had to set it down many times on their way back. [Illustration: Bringing back the groceries] Next Grandma made a twig broom and they swept the dirty ground. Mrs. Rugieri, next door, showed Grandma her beds, made of automobile seats put together on the ground. That night the Beecham men went to the nearest dumps and found enough seats to make a bed for Grandpa and Grandma and the baby. Fortunately it was not cold; coats were covering enough. On the dump Daddy found also an old tub, from which he made a stove, cutting holes in it, turning it upside down, and fastening in a stovepipe. "I don't feel to blame folks so much shall strew the ocean with its ruins, and give his icy form to the monsters of the summer seas." "Let us then to our task, Regnar," said La Salle, "for our friends may follow on our track, and I fear we shall have need of the closest secrecy concerning the fate of this unhappy man, at least until we are safely landed on civilized shores." Carefully descending the slippery way which led up to the aperture, they descended to the level ice, and seeking the floe, enveloped the body in one of the many seal-skins surrounding them, swathing it closely, and binding the hairy covering with strong lashings of raw hide, leaving loops at each extremity. Gently drawing it to the ice below the aperture, they ran the cord through the loops, knotting each firmly, so that nearly half the rope projected from each end. Taking one end, and setting the shrouded form upright against the smooth slope, the companions ascended to the aperture, and with some difficulty managed to haul up their unwonted burden. "We can find no footing here," said Regnar, who no longer affected his partial ignorance of English. "You, I think, had better descend again, and take a turn of your end around that pinnacle. I will go down into the grotto and guide its descent." [Illustration: KNEELING BESIDE IT, THE LAD BOWED HIS HEAD AS IF IN SILENT PRAYER. Page 269.] By this means the closely-swathed body was gently lowered into its last resting-place, and gathering up the axes and his rifle, La Salle followed to assist in in the final rites of sepulture. Regnar pointed to the centre of the floor. "That will furnish a pedestal which would befit the sarcophagus of a king." Among the irregular mounds formed by the dripping of water from the roof above, was an ice stalagmite, about five feet high, and seven feet in length, broad at the base, but rapidly narrowing to a sharp point. Attacking this with his axe, Regnar soon split off the point, and commenced hewing the stalagmite down to a uniform height of about two feet. La Salle assisted, and in the course of twenty minutes they had formed a snowy pedestal, whose irregular outline bore no small resemblance to that of the burden it was to sustain. Regnar cleared away the ice-chips, hurling the larger shards to an obscure corner, and carrying the smaller ones in his reversed fur cap. At last the work was completed to his satisfaction; and motioning to La Salle, he cast off the lashings, and raising the body, they placed it on the pedestal of ice. Drawing the long, slender dagger from its sheath, Regnar pierced several holes through the corners of the pedestal, and with the tough cords of raw hide lashed the body firmly to its spotless support; then kneeling beside it, the lad bowed his head as if in silent prayer. La Salle followed his example. For a moment or two he heard nothing but the ripple and plash of the ice-brook descending the side of the berg fifty yards away; but with the burial of his enemy, the lad's self-control had deserted him, and he burst into a passionate outbreak of sobs and tears. [Illustration] CHAPTER XX. A STRANGE LIFE-HISTORY.--AMONG THE RED INDIANS. La Salle had been, as we have said, displeased and disgusted, as well as puzzled, by much which had occurred; but his heart melted when he realized the sorrow and suffering, which, in spite of unusual self-restraint, was thus laid bare before him. He threw one arm around the boy's neck, and gently pressed his hand. "Forgive me, Regnar, if I have been unkind. I will be your friend if you desire it. Confide in me, and I will try to assist you, if you need aid or counsel." "You are kind, very kind, Charley; and perhaps I have been wrong in not trusting more in you heretofore. There is no time, however, like the present, and no more secret and fitting place than this burial-grot of the cause of all my sorrow." REGNAR'S HISTORY. "My father was a Danish youth of good parentage, whose strange and roving predilections sent him early in manhood to an outlying station in the north of Greenland, where, between his books and the wild life of that savage coast, he passed several years, until his unpleasant relations with the Danish officials made a change desirable, and he sought the Moravian settlements on the Labrador coast. "He had plenty of money, and soon became well known along the coast, which he searched thoroughly in his trading schooner, doing a brisk business in furs, seal-oil, and skins, and at the same time making frequent metallurgical discoveries and adventurous exploring expeditions. It was said that no man on the coast knew so much of the topography of Labrador, between Hamilton Inlet and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and a strange adventure opened to him new and startling experiences in the northern central portion of Newfoundland, then, as now, almost a _terra incognita_. "Twenty years ago he made his last voyage down the coast, attended by the man who lies yonder, an American, named Perry, a native of Baltimore, who, it afterwards transpired, fled from that city, having killed an opponent in a political quarrel. "Albert Perry was well educated, bold, and politic, and he formed a friendship with my father which ended only with life, and, as I believe, served him but too faithfully through good and ill, until death broke the bond between two men who were not fitted to lead the comparatively calm, eventless life which the laws of society, and the wants of the many prescribe to all; under penalty of social ostracism to the few who scorn to be fettered by a multitude of social conventionalities. "With this man as mate, and a crew of four Esquimaux, my father found himself, in July, in one of the little harbors, on the Newfoundland shore, of the Straits of Belle Isle. The night was dark, but calm, and at about ten he retired, to be awakened an hour later by Perry. "'Come on deck, captain; there's something going on up in the mountains yonder that I cannot make out.' "My father, already half dressed, was soon upon deck, and found the whole crew on the after-deck, gazing eagerly at the hills, which, covered with forest, surrounded the low land at the head of the bay. Near the summit of the highest, a fire of large size had been kindled, and lit up the dark sky above it, and the tops of the surrounding trees, with a deep crimson glow, while from time to time unearthly and savage cries were borne on the night air to the ears of the wondering voyagers. "'Have you any idea what that means, captain?' asked the American. "'What do you say, Krasippe?' said my father, addressing a huge-shouldered Esquimaux, grizzled and scarred, who had followed his fortunes from Greenland, and knew all the lore of his wandering brethren of the Labrador coast. "'Me tink it red Injin. Have dance; deer now come north. Marcus Jungsten, down at Hopedale, tell me he see such ting five year ago.' "'But the red Indians are all dead, captain,' said Perry, who had spent a year or two on the coast, and heard many stories of the unconquerable ferocity and final extinction of that strange race--the aborigines of Newfoundland. "'Such, indeed, is _said_ to be the case, but I have met several who have seen and heard similar things, such as we hear and see to-night, and they refer them to the presence of remnants of that savage and solitary race. I shall soon know, however. Krasippe, will you get your rifle, and go with me? "'I'll go with you, Hubel,' said Perry, eagerly. "But my father stopped, and said, gravely,-- "'There is too much of danger in this adventure for us both to risk our lives at once. Krasippe belongs to me. I have saved his life half a score of times, but I have no claim on you; and, besides, the vessel must be taken back to Hopedale, and you must stay to do it;' and so saying, he retired to his cabin. "When he returned, he carried in his hand a light rifle and a number of glittering wands, while a row of bright medals shone against the thick pile of a close-fitting robe of black velvet, and upon his head a cap of the same material, encircled by a strip of ermine, bore a single red feather, with an agraffe of diamonds. "'I have done wonders with this dress, amid the fire-rocks of the Nasquapees. Krasippe, old fellow, are you ready?' "Krasippe, grinning from ear to ear, nodded assent, and launching the captain's boat,--a light wherry for two pairs of sculls,--they pushed off from the vessel's side. "'Watch that spot,' said Hubel, 'and if you see the stars of this Roman candle, launch your boat, and come to the shore at once. Vasa there,' pointing to a huge Danish hound, 'will find me for you, if need be.' "An hour or two later, Perry saw the stars of green and crimson shooting through the lurid cloud into the midnight sky. A rifle-shot echoed through the valley and across the bay, and the fire was instantly extinguished. Perry, who had prepared everything for such an emergency, pushed off in his boat at once, taking his three men, all well armed, and Vasa, the great hound. Pulling at full speed, they struck in for the shore, and at last found the captain's boat hauled upon the beach. Taking the leash of the hound in his left hand, Perry sprang ashore, ordered his men to secure the boat, and lighting a dark lantern secured to his belt, he gave the word to Vasa, who set off, with an eager whine, at such a pace that it was hard to keep up with him. "In about half an hour they emerged into a large glade, and the hound stopped with a low howl over a prostrate body. It was that of Krasippe. He was lying on his face, with a deep gash on the shoulder, and a bruise on the top of the skull, but still breathed, although insensible. Perry, who doubted not that Hubel would be found near the body of his faithful follower, let slip the chain from Vasa's collar, and he at once darted off into the darkness, while Perry, drawing the slide of his bull's-eye, and pistol in hand, carefully examined the glade. "He found the remains of a large fire, some ten feet in circumference, still steaming with the water used to quench it, a few fragments of venison, as well as a hatchet-head of white quartz, broken from its helve, not far from where Krasippe had received his wound; but they looked in vain for their captain. "Morning had just dawned when Vasa reappeared, and wagging his tail, came up to Perry. Around his neck was looped a piece of birch bark, on opening which Perry found the following note:-- "'AMONG THE INDIANS--MIDNIGHT. "'I take my pencil to send you what may be my final directions, for as yet I am doubtful as to what may be my fate. Poor Vasa was about to be killed, as they dare keep no dogs; but I take advantage of his old tricks to send him to you. Take the vessel to Hopedale, and use her as if you were managing her for me, and next year at this time await me here. I have such an opportunity as no other man has had to learn the truth about these savages, and I risk my life willingly on the chance. (Signed) "'PAUL HUBEL.'" "Perry seized Vasa's collar and knotted the leash, then, turning to his men, ordered them to take up Krasippe and carry him down to the shore, where, launching the boat, they returned to the vessel. The next day they made sail, but it was several days before Krasippe recovered sufficiently to detail his portion of the adventure, which ran somewhat as follows:-- "'Me land with capten. We go up hill trough de hood. We see ten, twelve, Injin almos' naked, eatin', drinkin', dancin', an' yell like debbil. Capten say, "Stay here, Krasippe; I get hind bush." Capten creep trough bush, light cannle, an' bust out trough circle to middle of fire. I see fifty Injin fright dat way. Dose Injin not frighten much. I see one man jump on capten, trow him down, raise hatchet to kill him. Then one girl catch at his arm, an' I fire my rifle. Then I see no more until I wake up.'" "'Well, Krasippe, the captain is alive, and we are to meet him here in a year from now. In the mean time we'll try to navigate the Thyri, and make as much money for the skipper as we can;' and well he kept his word." "A year later the Thyri crept again into the rock-bound haven, and for a week Perry and his crew watched by night and day for his friend. At last, one evening they saw a fire on the shore opposite the vessel, and rowing ashore, a strange figure rushed to meet Perry, saying, 'I am here at last.'" "It was Hubel, but he was clad in tanned deerskins, ornamented with the dyed quills of the porcupine, and his face and naked breast were painted with a mixture of deer-suet and ocher, while from his hair, long, unshorn, and gathered into a knot, waved a plume of the war-eagle. His story I give in a few words." "'I advanced cautiously, intending to surprise and awe the Indians, as I have before done with the heathen savages, who still hunt beyond the head waters of the Mistassini, in the Labrador peninsula. As Krasippe told you, I failed; but the strange garb that I wore, and the interposition of a woman, saved my life for the time being, and the wonders of my magic wands added to the first impression, and gave me an importance I could have acquired in no other way. The riches and weapons of the whites have no charms for them, and the memory of their massacred and hunted relatives will never die until the last of the race sleep amid the islands of the great lakes of the interior; but when they saw me shake coals of fire at will from a wand filled with pyrophoric lead, they felt at once that I must be of another race than their persecutors.'" "'So they took me with them to the south, along the trail of the migrating reindeer; they gave me the best of their simple food and raiment, and the girl who saved my life came to my lodge, and served me with a love that I can never forget. She died in childbirth two months ago, and when I left the tribe to return to my own people, her father wanted to keep the infant, and at last I consented that he should remain with him a year longer. "Give me a token," said I, "and when, a year from now, you follow the deer northward, seek the bay, and if a vessel lies there at anchor, look each day in the glade for the signet of our bond. When you find it, leave the babe beside it, and I will take him across the ocean, and teach him to be wise and brave; then he shall come back to his tribe, and help them to become again a happy and powerful people.'" "The Thyri went northward, and Hubel was received as one who returns from the dead; but none save his mate knew the whole story of his wanderings." "'I have sworn to tell no one,' he said, in reply to all questionings, 'and should I break my oath, it would, in all human probability, cost the lives of the few remaining warriors of that unfortunate race. The people of Newfoundland can never blot out the memory of their past cruelties, and any party who strives to penetrate to their wilderness fastnesses, must either kill or be killed.'" "Before the next year elapsed, Hubel was summoned back to Denmark, having succeeded to his father's property; but before leaving Hopedale, he had a final interview with his chief officer." "'I give you, Perry, the Thyri and all her outfit, as well as the goods I have here, on one condition. You must keep the tryst I cannot keep, and bring the child you know of to the settlement at Hopedale. I have spoken to brother Hans, who will see after him until I send or come for him.'" "'I will do your bidding, Paul; but I shall not stay upon this coast after that job is over. There will be nothing to keep me in this desolate land after you leave it;' and tears glistened in the eyes of that cool, cynical, worldly-minded adventurer, for he really loved my father." "'When your work is done here, Albert, come to me in Denmark. There is enough for us both, and we have been so long together, that we shall never be happy apart. Will you come?'" "Perry said nothing, but pressing the hand of his friend with painful energy, he rushed up the beach, and seeking the hill behind the little settlement, watched the ship as she sailed out of the firth and disappeared in the gathering twilight. The next summer he sought the appointed spot, and left this talisman tied to the top of a bush, which stood alone almost in the centre of the glade." La Salle curiously examined the ring, whose gold circlet of European manufacture held securely an oval bit of jasper, on whose polished surface was cut the rude outline of a beaver wounded with an arrow. "The next day he went again: the stone had disappeared; but two arrows, headed with flint, lay beside the bush, one pointed to the interior, the other to the shore. 'I suppose that means "I go, I return," said he; and I shall find the child here to-morrow night.'" "He was right in his conjectures, for on going to the spot the next night, he found beneath the bush a little boy clad in a strange _mélange_ of Indian finery, and the bizarre attire worn by Paul Hubel when he set out on his strange adventure. That child was myself." La Salle had listened to the strange story with amazement, which increased as it progressed. "You tell me, Regnie, though, only of good deeds and faithful services rendered by the dead. You say that he loved your father, and served him faithfully as long as he lived." Regnar took up the word in bitter wrath, strangely mingled with regret. "As long as he _lived_--yes! But listen only until the end, and you shall judge for yourself of my justice to the memory of the dead. "On the breast of the babe lay the talisman, and a facsimile, pierced and suspended by a cord round the child's neck, lay beneath its clothing. See, I wear it still, and shall wear it until I meet again with my mother's people. "I must hasten to end my story. I was taken to Hopedale, where I remained ten years, at the end of which time Perry was sent from Europe to take me to my father, who had taken to his home a daughter born of an earlier marriage, whose mother, unable to understand the caprices of my father, had returned, almost broken-hearted, to her father's house, and died during his voluntary exile in Greenland. "I spent four years in Europe, studying most of the time at Bonn; and then my father sent for me, and I lived another year on his estate, learning all that I could of the various handicrafts and avocations, especially the best modes of agriculture. At the end of the fifth year, he called me into the library, and spoke to me as follows:-- "'You are now sixteen years of age, and you know that I have given you opportunities such as are seldom lavished on young men of your age. I would like to keep you with me longer, but I have told you of your mother, and the sufferings of her people. It is my wish that you should visit them within two years, and I have imparted to you much knowledge of their mode of life and government. Spend one year at Hopedale, and learn the lore of the fisherman and the craft of the hunter; and when I shall send you this ancient weapon, you will find within its hilt all that I dare not commit to paper, or the lips of my messenger.' "The week after, I sailed for Hopedale; but before the year of my stay had elapsed, I learned from a friend's letter of the sudden death of my father. 'I suppose that your father's friend and your sister have joined you in America, and that you will be consoled somewhat for your loss by their affection, and your changed fortunes.' "Thus ran the letter; but it was not until the arrival of the fall ship that I learned that my father was indeed no longer living, and that fully six months had elapsed since my sister, accompanied by the man who lies yonder, had set out to join her half brother, whom she had never seen, and to share with him the personal fortune of their common father; for the hereditary acres could not, by the laws of Denmark, fall to my lot, but went to the next nearest male relative. "Since that time I have sought everywhere for tidings of my sister's fate, or news of the whereabouts of that man. I heard of him once as a slaver, and a year ago I learned of his having been seen on this coast. I have but one more explanation to make, and that is of the strange statement I made to you, when we stood alone looking across the moonlit waste of the drifting pack. "About a month before you hired me at the trading post, I met Krasippe, now a very old man, and claiming some power as a prophet, or 'angekok,' among his people; for, although Christianized, they have not thrown off many of their old superstitions. He took me in his arms and wept over me, and growled a bitter curse on the treachery of his old associate. Then he appeared lost in deep thought, which seemed to absorb every sense, and his countenance became almost terrible in its fixed expression. At last, as if by no volition of his own, he uttered, in low, stern tones, the following rhapsody:-- "'You will meet in the desert of ice the man who will lead you to your heart's dearest wish. He shall lose, and you will gain.'" La Salle's face was pale, and his lips firmly set, as he listened to the ending of this strange recital; but he took up the broken chain of evidence, with the firm intention of finding the missing links. "Did you read my letter because you thought that Miss Randall might prove to be your sister?" "Yes, Charley, I did. Her name was Pauline Hubel. She was named after our father, Paul Hubel. My name is Regnar Orloff Hubel." "Well, Regnie, all I can tell you now is, that the young lady's English is not the best in the world, and that she is an orphan child. Of the whereabouts of her adopted father she knows nothing, but in a book which I took up there one day, I found written, 'A. P. Randall;' and Mrs. Randall said--" "What?" asked Regnar, hoarsely. "That it belonged to her brother. Now, Regnie," said La Salle, kindly, "you know all that I can tell you. Perhaps you may find in the hilt of yonder antique weapon the clew to much more. But we have other duties to perform; and first, how shall we seal up this cave so that no one can possibly suspect our having entered this place. That Peter has the eyes of a lynx, and should he follow us, would not fail to discover all." "In an hour hence," said Regnar, "no human being can stand where we are now, and you can walk the stanchest hound over the ledge, without his dreaming of what lies beneath. Come up to the top of the berg." Taking their equipments, they left the grotto, and issued through the narrow entrance. Regnar pointed to a shelving path, like a shallow groove in the face of the cliff. "Can we climb there?" said he. "I should think so," answered La Salle; and taking an axe and the end of the rope, he began to ascend the cliff along the shelving pathway. As he ascended, he heard behind him the blows of an axe, and, turning, saw Regnar cut a narrow cleft from the entrance of the cove to the level of the way to the top of the berg. "Are you mad," asked La Salle, "that you scatter your chips about the berg like that, and into the very pathway?" Regnar gave a finishing stroke to his work, and came lightly up the path. "I shall finish my work above," said he; and in a moment more they stood upon the summit. The brink of the pool lay near the edge of the cliff, and without stopping to look around him, Regnar commenced cutting a deep, narrow gutter from the pathway to the huge reservoir. As he struck the blows which shattered the thin wall of ice between the pool and its new outlet, the water poured in a stream a foot deep through the little canal, and down the slanting ledge into the cavern below. "I understand it now," said La Salle, "and I now know why you lashed the body to its support." "Yes," answered the boy, coolly, "should any try to break into yonder tomb to-morrow, they would do so at the risk of their lives; but if we have a week of frost, the cove will be full to its outlet of solid ice." "But, Regnar, let us think of something else. Where are the islands we saw last evening? We ought now to be near the southern shore of the group." "We have been wedged off to sea by stranded ice, I should judge; for there, about fifteen miles to the northward, lies Amherst Island." [Illustration] CHAPTER XXI. NORTHWARD AGAIN.--THE STEAMER.--TAKING TO THE BOAT. "Yes, Regnar, we are now on the outer side of the pack, and the wind has shifted to the southward again. Look to the eastward, Regnie. Has not the pack broken up there?" "Yes, the tide sets to the eastward, and the wind blows the heavy ice northward as soon as it clears the eastern shoals. See that berg going to pieces on Doyle's Reef!" As he spoke, the berg, a small one, worn by sun and rain into a multitude of fantastic pinnacles, swung off from its easterly drift, and, wafted by the wind, rapidly floated towards the concealed reef, whose sharp and hidden rocks can only be suspected during the prevalence of the heaviest storms. With a moderate rate of speed, not much exceeding two knots an hour, the massive base of the ice-island suddenly rose, as the shelving rocks received the irresistible impact. Then a few glittering pieces dimpled the surface of the unruffled water. It was the signal of impending dissolution. Crash upon crash, like the roar of artillery, echoed and re-echoed among the floes, and rent from base to pinnacle, the majestic frost-castle fell into utter ruin, torturing the sea into foam, while the billows raised by the rocking of the huge fragments swept up the narrow walls, sweeping right across many of the lower floes, and even raising a slight ripple around the base of the great berg itself. "We must return, Regnie. The clouds are darkening fast, and fog or a thick scud is sweeping up from the southward. Let us have one more look for the steamers, and then we must away to our friends." "There is a steamer on the outer edge of the pack, I think. You will see her smoke in line with the East Point yonder." "Yes, Regnie, that is a steamer, sure enough, and she will make her way to the centre of the pack. Let us hasten to the floe and take to the boats. We can perhaps reach her by rowing through the narrow leads before the gale rises." Hastening down the side of the watercourse they descended the berg, and set off along its base, in the direction of the hut. As they passed they gave a last glance at the sealer's tomb. Down the path they had ascended, dashed an overflowing torrent, which disappeared with a whirl and hollow gurgle into the yawning aperture, while the whole front of the wall which they had ascended, dripped with water and glittered with spray. "The keenest eye among the hunters of the Mistassini could not uncover that trail; and known to God and us alone is the bloody mystery of the Deadman's Berg." "Don't talk of that again, Regnie. Let the dead rest. Perhaps it may yet transpire that he was penitent at the last, and you may have good reason to rejoice that you knelt beside his last bed, in a tomb so wondrously beautiful." "We must hasten faster, Charley, for the fog _is_ coming, and we may find the floes separated. Remember our friends know nothing of all we have seen and heard, and to them I am still Regnar Orloff, half educated, and a simple pilot of the Labrador." With increased speed the pair pressed forward, crossing with difficulty the gulf, which had opened between the berg and the first heavy floe. Pole in hand, with one end of the rope attached to his belt, and his gun slung at his back, Orloff led the way, while La Salle followed at the other end, carrying an axe in his belt, and another in his hand. Luckily many large fragments lay floating in the first lead, and prevented from slipping by their sharp "crampets," they leaped from cake to cake, and safely reached the second floe. The mist clung damp to their faces as they attained the end of the second floe, where a lead of water some twenty yards in width, and clear of ice, intervened between them and the next. The quick eye of Regnar caught sight of a small ice-cake floating by the windward side of their floe, and leaping upon it, with pole and hands they shoved it along the steep walls of ice, and with their united force gave it a final impetus in the desired direction. The fragment whirled and bent beneath them, until the water stood above their ankles; but just as they began to fear a complete submersion, Orloff caught a projection of the field with his boat-hook, and the two landed in safety. As they hurried across the last floe, the rain fell, and the wind blew heavily, dashing huge cakes against the windward side with a ceaseless crashing of broken ice. Before they could reach the end of the field, they saw their own turn as if on a pivot, and grind slowly past the leeward point of the one across which they pressed at full speed. Their efforts were in vain, for before they could reach the verge their refuge was twenty feet distant; but Regnar was equal to the emergency. "Cast loose your rope, Charley," said he; and in five seconds he had coiled and whirled it twenty feet across the intervening chasm, to Peter, who seized and retained it. "Now, La Salle, follow me," he cried; and springing upon a floating fragment, he balanced himself with his pole until he reached a more stable support farther from the berg. The impetus, however, carried him too far away, and La Salle had to choose between committing himself to a fragment without rope or pole, to be tossed about by the rising sea, or to wait until Regnar should reach the floe, and return for him in the boat. He chose the latter, but soon had the pleasure of seeing Regnar safely landed on the floe, from whence, in almost less time than it takes to tell it, the three launched their boat and paddled up to the place where La Salle awaited their arrival, intently watching the performance of their improvised life-boat. He noted with pleasure that she drew little water, and that the light paddles drove her through the short, toppling sea with considerable speed, while her weather-boards prevented the shipping of any water. Leaping aboard, they soon crossed the narrow lead, and running under the lee of the ice-hills, drew their boat to the hut. "If you have anything you want to be sure to keep, stow it in the boat," was La Salle's first order, as he saw the sea begin to dash across the windward end of the floe, while, whining with fear, the young seals were shoved and pushed, by the flippers of their dams, farther and farther up on the higher ice, until, tamed by fear, they surrounded the little hollow containing the hut. Food, weapons, clothes, and ammunition were all deposited in the boat, as well as her mast, sail, and paddles, while her painter, attached to her sharp-pronged grapnel, lay coiled on her half-deck forward. All that afternoon the wind and sea arose, until, amid the drenching rain, they could hear around them the clamor of the terrified seals, the continual crash of breaking ice, and the sough of the heavy sea, whose spray drove over them in constantly increasing showers. At last an occasional wave came into the lower part of the little hollow, and all thought that the end was near. "We must take to the boat," said Regnar. But La Salle pointed to the ghostly crests of the surrounding seas; and bowing his head upon his breast, Orloff signified to his friend that he acknowledged the hopelessness of that resource. Just then a darker blackness seemed to gather to windward, as a shriller blast whistled by them; and as all awaited the increased fury of the elements which were to end the unequal struggle, the wind seemed to abate, and the waves sullenly retired from the surface of the floe. The rain still swept fiercely upon the drenched wanderers, and on their lee they could still note the crash of ice-islands, amid the sweep of the angry waves. But above them, huge, unbending, and majestic, towered a lofty pile, shrouded in darkness, through which at times gleamed the weird white outline of some snow-encrusted ledge. "Are we under the lee of Amherst Island?" asked Regnar, in a voice which all could hear. La Salle's answer came below his breath, and only Regnar heard, or could comprehend its meaning:-- "The dead are the defence of the living, and we are under the lee of Deadman's Berg." Safe from the rage of the elements, but cold, wet, and hungry, the adventurers sought the shelter of their hut, which still stood unhurt; but the fir branches of the floor were soaked with water, for a wave or two had risen above the ledge of the door. After much difficulty, with the aid of a candle, the Esquimaux lamp was lighted, and after much sputtering, the six wicks diffused their cheering light and grateful warmth through the hut. Then Peter, with his axe, cut a gutter through the doorway, letting off the standing water, and in the course of an hour the boughs were comparatively dry. Taking from the boats the dry skins and coverlets, the party lay down to rest, leaving Peter to keep watch lest they should again drift from their haven, and be exposed to the pitiless seas. All took their spell of duty; but the cheerless night passed without further incident, and the day found them still under the shadow of the great berg. As the day advanced, the storm swept the pack northward, and the party, ascending the berg, saw, one by one, the isolated crags of the island chain of the Magdalens loom at times through the driving scud, as they drove northward. Six or eight miles away they saw the masts of a vessel deep in the heart of the floe. "When the storm is over and the pack opens, we must take our boat and reach that sealer," said La Salle; and taking the range of her position, the four sought their hut, and building a huge fire of all their remaining wood, prepared all the cooked meat which they could carry, filled the seal-membranes with oil, and awaited the lull of the storm and the opening of the pack. At sunset the storm had broken, the clouds began to disappear, and through their rifts the stars glimmered, and the new moon shone palely beautiful. "We shall not pass the North Cape much before morning," said La Salle, "and until then the pack will not open. When it does we are ready; so sleep, and I will watch." His tired comrades flung themselves down, and were almost instantly asleep. As the dawn approached the wind lessened, and as the day broke, he called Regnar, and again ascended the berg. On the right hand towered the rock-bound coast of the northern islands and the isolated crags of Bryon. And as they looked northward they saw the pack opening again: as it issued from under the lee, a black cloud of smoke rose from the sealer's funnel, but instead of steering east or west, she was evidently heading for the great berg. "Shall we await them here, or take our boat and try to reach them, Regnar?" asked La Salle. "Wait a little longer, and then, when the ice opens, push a little more to the eastward, and work down to meet the vessel," said the lad, who proceeded to examine the dagger so strangely returned to his keeping. The blade unscrewed at the cross-piece of the hilt, which was hollow, and contained many papers closely compressed into a single roll. Regnar ran his eye over the contents, and selecting one, returned the rest to their odd receptacle. "This paper, Charley, contains an inventory of the property confided to Perry, to be equally divided between my half-sister and myself." And he proceeded to translate the items of the inventory. "It is hardly worth while to give this paper in full; suffice it to say that besides various pictures, books, arrows, weapons, sets of plate, jewels, and other heirlooms, 'stored in care of Nicholas Orloff, my mother's brother,' there appeared a schedule of moneys and bonds amounting to nearly one hundred thousand dollars. 'These funds have been committed,' the paper went on to say, 'to my faithful friend Albert Perry, whom I commend to your good offices and implicit trust.'" As he ceased reading, the boy's face was turned to the ice-cliff, where the plashing water flowed in a huge sheet, like a falling veil, over the face of the berg, shutting out from sight the twining pillars and narrow entrance of the sealer's tomb. "I have rendered him the last 'good office,'" said he. "It only remains to seek yonder vessel, and find out who spoiled the spoiler, and, if possible, recover the valuables and papers taken from Perry's body." "There is the steamer heading this way," said La Salle, "and the leads are fast opening. Let us descend to the floe, and by the time we have breakfasted, we shall find ample room between the fields to let us pass in safety." Descending, they found their comrades already at breakfast, and by the time the meal was disposed of, their floe lay surrounded by one of the leads of open water, which showed scarce a vestige of the heavy seas of the late gale. For the last time they packed their few valuables into the boat, and stowing Carlo away under deck, took their allotted places, dipped their paddles into the open water, and with rapid strokes threaded the narrow channels, scaring the timid seals from their path, and noting on every hand scenes of life and beauty, for amid the opening pack the varied life of the Bird islands around them met their view. Screaming gannets wheeled in clouds over their heads, and portly murres started up heavily from the frequent pools, into which they broke with flashing paddles, and laughter, such as they had never before indulged in since their first misadventure. [Illustration: "IN HIS HANDS LA SALLE WAVED THE BANNER." Page 297.] Guided by the pillar of black smoke, which, winding this way and that, ever drew nearer and nearer, they came at last to an open pool, nearly a quarter of a mile or more in length. On the opposite side, above a small floe, they saw the prow of the advancing vessel. Evidently she had met with a check, for as they gazed they heard the tinkle of the engine bell, and saw her iron-sheathed bow recede behind the fantastic outlines of the pinnacle. "Will she leave us?" asked Waring, with trembling lips. "They only back to run down that floe. See now." The next moment Regnar's prediction was verified. A blacker cloud of smoke, shot with sparks, poured from the funnel; the huge hull rapidly advanced, her raking prow, with its iron armor, piercing the waves like the blade of the sword-fish. There was a crash, a momentary glimpse of falling ice and splitting walls, and the next moment the noble steamer came at half speed across the open water, just as the little boat shot out of the sheltering lead. In his hands La Salle waved the banner attached to the boat-hook, which had marked the deserted heaps of seal-skins. But it needed not: the pilot rang his bell, and the sealer became motionless in the centre of the pool. As they came alongside, a stout, full-bearded man, in a Guernsey frock, threw them a rope, and hailed the strange little craft:-- "What, do'ee want, friends, and where do'ee hail from?" "We are sportsmen, carried off, by the ice, in the straits, eleven days ago. We want food, and a passage home, for which we will pay." "Well, if ivir I heerd of de like of dat! Come aboord, my men. De captain's sick, but dere's plinty to ate here, and ye won't mind close quarters, after your vige on de ice." "No, indeed, sir!" said La Salle. "Tumble up, my men. Take your guns and your coats with you. Here, Nep; up that ladder, sir. That's right. Can you take our boat aboard?" "Come right up, sur; dere's no fear of her. I'll have her aboord in tin minutes. Here comes de mate. What's your name, sur? La Salle? Yis, sur! Mister Blake, sur; Mister La Salle, sur." "Happy to see you, Mr. La Salle. I've learnt enough about you to know that you have been adrift nearly two weeks, and as dinner's ready we must have you into the cabin. I am sorry that but one berth is vacant, and your friends will have to take their chance in the forecastle." "If you please, I had rather have you extend your courtesy to Mr. George Waring, a son of Mr. Albert Waring, of C., who does a large business with your St. John's fishing firms. He has been the only one of us who has been sick, and--" "There, Mr. Blake," interposed Waring, "don't listen to him; take him with you. Why, I am as strong as an ox now, and you'll find him far better company than I am." Passing aft through gangways crowded with brawny, hardy-looking sealers, La Salle followed his conductor to the cabin, where he found six or eight men gathered around a table plentifully supplied with the usual provisions found on board ships in the merchant service. After being introduced to all present, who greeted him with a rude civility, Mr. Blake invited him to "fall to and help himself." It is needless to say that he required no pressing in this direction. "Hard tack" and "salt horse," with potatoes, soft bread, and chicory coffee sweetened with molasses, seemed food fit for the gods, after the greasy meat-diet of the last eleven days; and his companions considerately refrained from questioning him until his hunger was satisfied. At last he drew back his chair, lit a cigar offered him by one of the officers, and turning to the mate said, laughingly,-- "Fire away, gentlemen--I'm ready." After narrating the principal events of their voyage so far as he deemed prudent, he concluded as follows:-- "Two or three days ago we fell in with large sealing-floes, and among them one where a sealer had killed several hundred seals. A boat-hook, which you will find in our boat, bore this signal. Am I right in supposing that this is the name of your vessel?" and so saying he drew from his pocket the tiny pennon. "It is ours, and we have been trying for a week to recover our skins, as well as the body of Captain Randall, whom we lost eight days ago." Not a muscle of La Salle's face betrayed any emotion save that of interest, as he asked,-- "Lost your captain! And how, pray?" At that moment a noise was heard in the inner cabin, as if several men were struggling; all at once the door flew open, and, with difficulty restrained by the utmost efforts of two powerful men, a pale, unshorn face, surmounting a wild and scantily-dressed figure, appeared to the party, none of whom started save La Salle, who almost fancied that the dead man, sealed up in the caverns of the ice, had come back again to his quarters on board the Mercedes. Crying out, "I couldn't save him! I couldn't save him!" the intruder was dragged, struggling and raving, back to his berth. "Poor George! he takes the death of his brother sadly to heart. He was mate, and the other day they left the floe together, to ascend a large berg at some distance from our whaling-ground. We saw them on the top, after which they disappeared, going to the opposite side by which they had ascended. Shortly after we heard several rifle shots fired in quick succession, and then George came running towards us, shouting that his brother had fallen between the floes, and was drowning. "We ran to the spot, and found a place between two floes where the ice was much broken up, as if some one had tried to catch something with a boat-hook; and Randall told us that his brother had fallen through and been carried under the ice before he could get to him. We broke the ice all around, but to no purpose; and then our lookouts discovered that we were in danger of getting nipped on the other side of the Magdalens. So we returned to the ship with George, sadly enough." "Why were the rifle-shots fired? to call for assistance?" asked La Salle. "Yes. None of our men have the rifle, although many are supplied with the old sealing-gun. We therefore agreed among the officers that three shots, fired in rapid succession, should call assistance in case of danger, or trouble with the men. Our rifles are all breech-loading carbines, and we can fire with great rapidity." "Do you find them of service among the seals?" "Yes, especially with the 'old hoods;' and poor Captain Randall, who spent some years in Europe, had his ammunition fitted so that the bullets explode on striking a bone. They tear a terrible hole in a seal, I assure you." "Indeed! I never saw one of them, although it seems to me that I have read of the invention. Have you any of the bullets here? for I suppose the rifle was lost at the same time." The sailing-master, or rather pilot, a short, thick-set Newfoundlander, took up the conversation. "Dere's de rifle now, hangin' over your head. De captain was ailin', an' his brother, who fancied de little piece, carried it. Dere's one of de cartridges in it yet." So saying, he took down a short carbine of the Spencer pattern, and unlocking the slide, took out a cartridge and handed it to La Salle. It displayed at the end of the ball the copper capsule of a rifle-shell. "Let us go on deck," said Blake, rising; but as they passed again through the narrow passage, they heard the struggles of the delirious captain, and his oft-repeated cry, "I couldn't save him! I couldn't save him!" [Illustration] CHAPTER XXII. THE FORECASTLE OF THE SEALER.--A SEALER'S STORY.--THE LAST HUNT.--ARRIVAL AT ST. JOHN'S. In the quarters of the men forward, between the lofty and wedge-like bows, the rest of the party met with a warm reception; and although grease was everywhere a prominent feature of the surroundings, still the sense of comfort, warmth, and security, made it a paradise to men who had passed so many days of discomfort and anxiety. Huge kids of beef, potatoes, and bread, with hot pannikins of strong black tea, formed their dinner, which most of the men preferred to eat on deck; but the boatswain, or rather captain of the forecastle, with, perhaps, a dozen others, seated themselves at the long hanging shelf which formed the table, and listened intently to the story of their varied wanderings and adventures. As Regnar concluded, a grizzly-haired sealer from Kitty Vitty seized him by the hand. A SEALER'S STORY. "Ye've ben lucky, sur; de Lord be praised for't, for dere's many a better man nor you dat's died wid hunger an' cold on de ice. I mind once myself dat I sailed out o' Conception in March, an' tree weeks after dat we were up off Hamilton Inlet. Dere was a big fleet of us boys, for dat was in de ould times when dere were no steamers, but only brigantines mostly. "Well, dere was ould Ned Shea in de Li'n, an' Jim Daygle in de Ringdove, an' Bill 'Hearne in de Swiler's Bride, an ourselves in de Truelove, all in company; an' dat night at dusk we made de Greenland ice. Well, de wind was west-nor'-west, an' we put de studdin'-sils onto her, an' away we went flamin' mad through der slob. "Well, de ice giv us many a heavy thump dat night, but de ould Truelove was well fastened, an' at daylight next mornin', we heard de watch cry, 'Swiles! Swiles! On deck, below dere!' You may be sure we wasn't long in gettin' on deck wid our guns an' gaffs, an', sure enough, dere dey was, ould an' young, _atin' de shaydn_ (sheathing) _off her_. "Den we launched de boats an' took to de ice; an' when we landed, de capten said, 'Trow your guns in de boats, an' at dem wid de gaff;' an' such a massacree I never saw since. De first I killed was a 'harp;' an' den I killed a 'hood' wid de first lick; an' den a 'jenny' an' tree 'white coats;' but I took my toe to dem, an' all of 'em in a bit of a hollow not bigger den dis fo'c's'le, an' I sculped dem an' put dere sculps on a pinnacle; an' so it was all day an' de next. "But on de t'ird day we were hard at it a good way from de vessil, an' I tought I saw some swiles under a hummock, an' I ran up swingin' my club; but dey didn't stir, an' den I saw dat dey wasn't swiles. Dey was Huskies, two of 'em, dead an' frozen stiff. Dere lines an' lances lay beside 'em, an' knives of hoop-iron, wid bone hannles, were in dere boots; but dere was no sign of anythin' to ate, an' dey looked wasted to 'natomies. "I called de odders, an' de capten come up an' looked at dem a minute sorrowful-like, an' den said, 'Poor fellows! dey've been carried off'n de ice, an' starved till dey froze to death;' an' he tould us to bury dem daycently, an' we closed dem up in a pinnacle. "But it was lucky we was near loaded, for dat put a chill on our min', an' de tought of dose dead Huskies lost us many a fine swile, for de boys wouldn't scatter over de ice as dey used to. "It wasn't long after dat de capten tould us dat we were full enough, an' away we sailed to de sou'-east." "Dat was de time de Li'n was lost--wasn't it?" inquired another islesman. "Yes; on de way down we had an awful gale, an' de Li'n put into de pack an' got 'nipped,' so dat she went down; but her crew was all saved in de boats. We put off to say, an' for two days an' nights I tought we should never say land. Why, we lay to as long as we dared, an' until our deck was full of water, an' de capten said we mus' do somethin' else, or we should founder. "I stood in de fore-riggin' an' watched de big says as dey come down upon us; an' I'll tell you one thing you'll do well to remember. Whenever a big wave come dat I knew would sink us, if it broke upon us, _I made de sign of de holy cross, an' de wave broke before it reached us_." "I've done de same ting often myself, an' nivir knew it to fail," said the younger man, who, it appeared, was the son of the veteran sealer. "But how did you get clear finally?" asked Regnar. "De ould capten dat was drownded de oder day was mate den. He was a wild young chap, but smart an' able. He tould de capten to rig one of de pumps, and pump some of de oily water out of de hold. So de brakes was rigged, but he an' de capten had to man dem at first, for all de rest were afeard, an' I was in de fore-riggin' watchin' de says. "Well, dey pumped a while, an' de oil an' water went overboard, an' as we went driftin' away to leeward, I saw de slick of de ile spreadin' over de waves. We kept a couple of men at de pumps till night, an' dere wasn't another say broke over us." * * * * * "Swiles! Swiles! On deck, dere below!" cried some one on deck; and a general rush up the steep ladder leading to the deck took place. Following the others, our three friends soon found their companion, La Salle, who had pressed through the crowded gangways to his party. Again they lay below the Deadman's Berg, and around them were the floes, crowded with living seals, as well as the one over which the ravenous sea-birds fluttered, holding high carnival over the multitude of frozen bodies. The crew, armed with guns and clubs, were lowering their light boats, and the party dragging their own boat to the side, awaited the lowering of a boat to use its falls for their own. Blake approached them, and said, kindly,-- "I wouldn't land; you must be tired, and need rest. Just turn in, all of you, in the cabin, for we shall be ashore all day." "We would rather hunt with you, for we shall never probably have another chance to see how a Newfoundland sealer kills his game. Only, if you please, let us have some sheath-knives, and four of your clubs." Merely saying, "We shall be very glad of your help, for we have to leave two of our best men with the captain," Blake spoke to an under-officer, who soon produced four sharp sheath-knives, and as many oaken clubs about six feet long, ringed at the top with iron, and furnished with a sharp hook, or gaff; and lowering their little craft, the four paddled stoutly after the fleet of boats, whose wild crews tore the water into foam with their oars, as each strove to reach the floes, and to "win the first blood." Sixty men, besides La Salle's party, swept across the pool, almost flung their light boats upon the safe ice, and prevented from slipping by their spiked crampets, charged at full speed upon the frightened seals, who filled the air with their clamorous roars and whining. Crick, crack! fell the heavy clubs on every side, and seldom was the stroke repeated; but sometimes an "ould hood" would elevate his inflated helmet, and the heavy club would fall upon it, producing a hollow sound, that boomed high above the noise of the conflict. Then the officer in charge of that gang would step up, present his carbine, and the brave seal, shot through the brain, would fall back dead, as the report rattled among the ice-peaks. Having disposed of the adults, a regular butchery took place among the young seals, who were easily despatched by a blow on the nose, or a kick with the heavy heel of a sealer's boot on the spinal vertebræ. Then followed the "sculping," or skinning, which was despatched with marvellous rapidity. At its close the men, covered with blood and oil, gathered to their boats, and leaving the floe crimsoned with gore, and horrible with bloody and skinless carcasses, hastened to another field to continue the work of death. Such for two days were the scenes presented to the eyes of the companions, who received many commendations for their assistance, but who rejoiced beyond measure when the word was passed through the ship that she was "full," and that they were to sail at once for St. John's. [Illustration] Once more the black funnel poured forth its cloud of smoke, and casting off the lines which attached her to the surrounding ice, the Mercedes pressed boldly into the pack, and soon our adventurers gazed for the last time on the fading outlines of the Deadman's Berg. Two days later, as the steamer rounded Cape Race, the captain, worn and weak, but evidently in his right mind, appeared at the table. On being introduced to La Salle, he seemed somewhat agitated, but soon assumed an overbearing and despotic demeanor. To Mr. Blake he was particularly insulting. "I'll have you know, sir, that I am captain now; ay, and owner, too, sir, for my poor brother left neither chick nor child in the world but me. Damn me, sir! what right have you to invite everybody to my table and cabin? ay, and put a stranger into my brother's very state-room?" Blake looked confounded, and the other officers sat with bowed heads and lowering brows at this insult to a man they all loved and respected; but La Salle unconcernedly turned to the newly-fledged commander, and said,-- "I regret, captain--really, I forget your name; but let that pass; but when I came on board, I told this gentleman that I would sleep forward with the men. I have not cared to speak about it before, but I can assure you that I have the worst dreams in that state-room that I ever had in my life. I shall try to recompense you for the passage of my companions and myself when we arrive at St. John's;" and rising, he bowed haughtily, and withdrew to the deck. Ten minutes later he was joined by Blake. "The captain has apologized to us, and begs that you store for the tragic comedian. He had now no wish for golden riches, nor even for power. He wished to lead the simple life and to listen to the pipings of Pan along with the goat-herds on the mountains or the wild creatures in the woods. Thus it befell that he was present one day at a contest between Pan and Apollo himself. It was a day of merry-making for nymphs and fauns and dryads, and all those who lived in the lonely solitudes of Phrygia came to listen to the music of the god who ruled them. For as Pan sat in the shade of a forest one night and piped on his reeds until the very shadows danced, and the water of the stream by which he sat leapt high over the mossy stones it passed, and laughed aloud in its glee, the god had so gloried in his own power that he cried: "Who speaks of Apollo and his lyre? Some of the gods may be well pleased with his music, and mayhap a bloodless man or two. But my music strikes to the heart of the earth itself. It stirs with rapture the very sap of the trees, and awakes to life and joy the innermost soul of all things mortal." Apollo heard his boast, and heard it angrily. "Oh, thou whose soul is the soul of the untilled ground!" he said, "wouldst thou place thy music, that is like the wind in the reeds, beside my music, which is as the music of the spheres?" And Pan, splashing with his goat's feet amongst the water-lilies of the stream on the bank of which he sat, laughed loudly and cried: "Yea, would I, Apollo! Willingly would I play thee a match--thou on thy golden lyre--I on my reeds from the river." Thus did it come to pass that Apollo and Pan matched against each other their music, and King Midas was one of the judges. First of all Pan took his fragile reeds, and as he played, the leaves on the trees shivered, and the sleeping lilies raised their heads, and the birds ceased their song to listen and then flew straight to their mates. And all the beauty of the world grew more beautiful, and all its terror grew yet more grim, and still Pan piped on, and laughed to see the nymphs and the fauns first dance in joyousness and then tremble in fear, and the buds to blossom, and the stags to bellow in their lordship of the hills. When he ceased, it was as though a tensely-drawn string had broken, and all the earth lay breathless and mute. And Pan turned proudly to the golden-haired god who had listened as he had spoken through the hearts of reeds to the hearts of men. "Canst, then, make music like unto my music, Apollo?" he said. Then Apollo, his purple robes barely hiding the perfection of his limbs, a wreath of laurel crowning his yellow curls, looked down at Pan from his godlike height and smiled in silence. For a moment his hand silently played over the golden strings of his lyre, and then his finger-tips gently touched them. And every creature there who had a soul, felt that that soul had wings, and the wings sped them straight to Olympus. Far away from all earth-bound creatures they flew, and dwelt in magnificent serenity amongst the Immortals. No longer was there strife, or any dispeace. No more was there fierce warring between the actual and the unknown. The green fields and thick woods had faded into nothingness, and their creatures, and the fair nymphs and dryads, and the wild fauns and centaurs longed and fought no more, and man had ceased to desire the impossible. Throbbing nature and passionately desiring life faded into dust before the melody that Apollo called forth, and when his strings had ceased to quiver and only the faintly remembered echo of his music remained, it was as though the earth had passed away and all things had become new. For the space of many seconds all was silence. Then, in low voice, Apollo asked: "Ye who listen--who is the victor?" And earth and sea and sky, and all the creatures of earth and sky, and of the deep, replied as one: "The victory is thine, Divine Apollo." Yet was there one dissentient voice. Midas, sorely puzzled, utterly un-understanding, was relieved when the music of Apollo ceased. "If only Pan would play again," he murmured to himself. "I wish to live, and Pan's music gives me life. I love the woolly vine-buds and the fragrant pine-leaves, and the scent of the violets in the spring. The smell of the fresh-ploughed earth is dear to me, the breath of the kine that have grazed in the meadows of wild parsley and of asphodel. I want to drink red wine and to eat and love and fight and work and be joyous and sad, fierce and strong, and very weary, and to sleep the dead sleep of men who live only as weak mortals do." Therefore he raised his voice, and called very loud: "Pan's music is sweeter and truer and greater than the music of Apollo. Pan is the victor, and I, King Midas, give him the victor's crown!" With scorn ineffable the sun-god turned upon Midas, his peasant's face transfigured by his proud decision. For a little he gazed at him in silence, and his look might have turned a sunbeam to an icicle. Then he spoke: "The ears of an ass have heard my music," he said. "Henceforth shall Midas have ass's ears." And when Midas, in terror, clapped his hands to his crisp black hair, he found growing far beyond it, the long, pointed ears of an ass. Perhaps what hurt him most, as he fled away, was the shout of merriment that came from Pan. And fauns and nymphs and satyrs echoed that shout most joyously. Willingly would he have hidden in the woods, but there he found no hiding-place. The trees and shrubs and flowering things seemed to shake in cruel mockery. Back to his court he went and sent for the court hairdresser, that he might bribe him to devise a covering for these long, peaked, hairy symbols of his folly. Gladly the hairdresser accepted many and many oboli, many and many golden gifts, and all Phrygia wondered, while it copied, the strange headdress of the king. But although much gold had bought his silence, the court barber was unquiet of heart. All day and all through the night he was tormented by his weighty secret. And then, at length, silence was to him a torture too great to be borne; he sought a lonely place, there dug a deep hole, and, kneeling by it, softly whispered to the damp earth: "King Midas has ass's ears." Greatly relieved, he hastened home, and was well content until, on the spot where his secret lay buried, rushes grew up. And when the winds blew through them, the rushes whispered for all those who passed by to hear: "King Midas has ass's ears! King Midas has ass's ears!" Those who listen very carefully to what the green rushes in marshy places whisper as the wind passes through them, may hear the same thing to this day. And those who hear the whisper of the rushes may, perhaps, give a pitying thought to Midas--the tragic comedian of mythology. CEYX AND HALCYONE "St. Martin's summer, halcyon days." _King Henry VI_, i. 2, 131. "Halcyon days"--how often is the expression made use of, how seldom do its users realise from whence they have borrowed it. "These were halcyon days," says the old man, and his memory wanders back to a time when for him "All the world is young, lad, And all the trees are green; And every goose a swan, lad, And every lass a queen." Yet the story of Halcyone is one best to be understood by the heavy-hearted woman who wanders along the bleak sea-beach and strains her weary eyes for the brown sail of the fishing-boat that will never more return. Over the kingdom of Thessaly, in the days of long ago, there reigned a king whose name was Ceyx, son of Hesperus, the Day Star, and almost as radiant in grace and beauty as was his father. His wife was the fair Halcyone, daughter of Æolus, ruler of the winds, and most perfectly did this king and queen love one another. Their happiness was unmarred until there came a day when Ceyx had to mourn for the loss of a brother. Following close on the heels of this disaster came direful prodigies which led Ceyx to fear that in some way he must have incurred the hostility of the gods. To him there was no way in which to discover wherein lay his fault, and to make atonement for it, but by going to consult the oracle of Apollo at Claros, in Ionia. When he told Halcyone what he must do, she knew well that she must not try to turn him from his solemn purpose, yet there hung over her heart a black shadow of fear and of evil foreboding that no loving words of assurance could drive away. Most piteously she begged him to take her with him, but the king knew too well the dangers of the treacherous Ægean Sea to risk on it the life of the woman that he loved so well. "I promise," he said, "by the rays of my Father the Day Star, that if fate permits I will return before the moon shall have twice rounded her orb." Down by the shore the sailors of King Ceyx awaited his coming, and when with passionately tender love he and Halcyone had taken farewell of each other, the rowers sat down on the benches and dipped their long oars into the water. With rhythmic swing they drove the great ship over the grey sea, while Ceyx stood on deck and gazed back at his wife until his eyes could no longer distinguish her from the rocks on the shore, nor could she any longer see the white sails of the ship as it crested the restless waves. Heavier still was her heart when she turned away from the shore, and yet more heavy it grew as the day wore on and dark night descended. For the air was full of the clamorous wailings of the fierce winds whose joy it is to lash the waves into rage and to strew with dead men and broken timber the angry, surf-beaten shore. "My King," she sighed to herself. "My King! my Own!" And through the weary hours she prayed to the gods to bring him safely back to her, and many times she offered fragrant incense to Juno, protectress of women, that she might have pity on a woman whose husband and true lover was out in the storm, a plaything for ruthless winds and waves. A helpless plaything was the king of Thessaly. Long ere the dim evening light had made of the shore of his own land a faint, grey line, the white-maned horses of Poseidon, king of the seas, began to rear their heads, and as night fell, a black curtain, blotting out every landmark, and all home-like things, the East Wind rushed across the Ægean Sea, smiting the sea-horses into madness, seizing the sails with cruel grasp and casting them in tatters before it, snapping the mast as though it were but a dry reed by the river. Before so mighty a tempest no oars could be of any avail, and for a little time only the winds and waves gambolled like a half-sated wolf-pack over their helpless prey. With hungry roar the great weight of black water stove in the deck and swept the sailors out of the ship to choke them in its icy depths; and ever it would lift the wounded thing high up on its foaming white crests, as though to toss it to the dark sky, and ever again would suck it down into the blackness, while the shrieking winds drove it onward with howling taunts and mocking laughter. While life stayed in him, Ceyx thought only of Halcyone. He had no fear, only the fear of the grief his death must bring to her who loved him as he loved her, his peerless queen, his Halcyone. His prayers to the gods were prayers for her. For himself he asked one thing only--that the waves might bear his body to her sight, so that her gentle hands might lay him in his tomb. With shout of triumph that they had slain a king, winds and waves seized him even as he prayed, and the Day Star that was hidden behind the black pall of the sky knew that his son, a brave king and a faithful lover, had gone down to the Shades. When Dawn, the rosy-fingered, had come to Thessaly, Halcyone, white-faced and tired-eyed, anxiously watched the sea, that still was tossing in half-savage mood. Eagerly she gazed at the place where last the white sail had been seen. Was it not possible that Ceyx, having weathered the gale, might for the present have foregone his voyage to Ionia, and was returning to her to bring peace to her heart? But the sea-beach was strewn with wrack and the winds still blew bits of tattered surf along the shore, and for her there was only the heavy labour of waiting, of waiting and of watching for the ship that never came. The incense from her altars blew out, in heavy sweetness, to meet the bitter-sweet tang of the seaweed that was carried in by the tide, for Halcyone prayed on, fearful, yet hoping that her prayers might still keep safe her man--her king--her lover. She busied herself in laying out the garments he would wear on his return, and in choosing the clothes in which she might be fairest in his eyes. This robe, as blue as the sky in spring--silver-bordered, as the sea in kind mood is bordered with a feathery silver fringe. She could recall just how Ceyx looked when first he saw her wear it. She could hear his very tones as he told her that of all queens she was the peeress, of all women the most beautiful, of all wives the most dear. Almost she forgot the horrors of the night, so certain did it seem that his dear voice must soon again tell her the words that have been love's litany since ever time began. In the ears of Juno those petitions for him whose dead body was even then being tossed hither and thither by the restless waves, his murderers, came at last to be more than even she could bear. She gave command to her handmaiden Iris to go to the palace of Somnus, god of Sleep and brother of Death, and to bid him send to Halcyone a vision, in the form of Ceyx, to tell her that all her weary waiting was in vain. In a valley among the black Cimmerian mountains the death-god Somnus had his abode. In her rainbow-hued robes, Iris darted through the sky at her mistress's bidding, tingeing, as she sped through them, the clouds that she passed. It was a silent valley that she reached at last. Here the sun never came, nor was there ever any sound to break the silence. From the ground the noiseless grey clouds, whose work it is to hide the sun and moon, rose softly and rolled away up to the mountain tops and down to the lowest valleys, to work the will of the gods. All around the cave lurked the long dark shadows that bring fear to the heart of children, and that, at nightfall, hasten the steps of the timid wayfarer. No noise was there, but from far down the valley there came a murmur so faint and so infinitely soothing that it was less a sound than of a lullaby remembered in dreams. For past the valley of Sleep flow the waters of Lethe, the river of Forgetfulness. Close up to the door of the cave where dwelt the twin brothers, Sleep and Death, blood-red poppies grew, and at the door itself stood shadowy forms, their fingers on their lips, enjoining silence on all those who would enter in, amaranth-crowned, and softly waving sheaves of poppies that bring dreams from which there is no awakening. There was there no gate with hinges to creak or bars to clang, and into the stilly darkness Iris walked unhindered. From outer cave to inner cave she went, and each cave she left behind was less dark than the one that she entered. In the innermost room of all, on an ebony couch draped with sable curtains, the god of sleep lay drowsing. His garments were black, strewn with golden stars. A wreath of half-opened poppies crowned his sleepy head, and he leaned on the strong shoulder of Morpheus, his favourite son. All round his bed hovered pleasant dreams, gently stooping over him to whisper their messages, like a field of wheat swayed by the breeze, or willows that bow their silver heads and murmur to each other the secrets that no one ever knows. Brushing the idle dreams aside, as a ray of sunshine brushes away the grey wisps of mist that hang to the hillside, Iris walked up to the couch where Somnus lay. The light from her rainbow-hued robe lit up the darkness of the cave, yet Somnus lazily only half-opened his eyes, moved his head so that it rested more easily, and in a sleepy voice asked of her what might be her errand. "Somnus," she said, "gentlest of gods, tranquilliser of minds and soother of careworn hearts, Juno sends you her commands that you despatch a dream to Halcyone in the city of Trachine, representing her lost husband and all the events of the wreck." Her message delivered, Iris hastened away, for it seemed to her that already her eyelids grew heavy, and that there were creeping upon her limbs, throwing silver dust in her eyes, lulling into peaceful slumber her mind, those sprites born of the blood-red poppies that bring to weary mortals rest and sweet forgetfulness. Only rousing himself sufficiently to give his orders, Somnus entrusted to Morpheus the task imposed upon him by Juno, and then, with a yawn, turned over on his downy pillow, and gave himself up to exquisite slumber. When he had winged his way to Trachine, Morpheus took upon himself the form of Ceyx and sought the room where Halcyone slept. She had watched the far horizon many hours that day. For many an hour had she vainly burned incense to the gods. Tired in heart and soul, in body and in mind, she laid herself down on her couch at last, hoping for the gift of sleep. Not long had she slept, in the dead-still sleep that weariness and a stricken heart bring with them, when Morpheus came and stood by her side. He was only a dream, yet his face was the face of Ceyx. Not the radiant, beautiful son of the Day Star was the Ceyx who stood by her now and gazed on her with piteous, pitying dead eyes. His clothing dripped sea-water; in his hair was tangled the weed of the sea, uprooted by the storm. Pale, pale was his face, and his white hands gripped the stones and sand that had failed him in his dying agony. Halcyone whimpered in her sleep as she looked on him, and Morpheus stooped over her and spoke the words that he had been told to say. "I am thy husband, Ceyx, Halcyone. No more do prayers and the blue-curling smoke of incense avail me. Dead am I, slain by the storm and the waves. On my dead, white face the skies look down and the restless sea tosses my chill body that still seeks thee, seeking a haven in thy dear arms, seeking rest on thy warm, loving heart." With a cry Halcyone started up, but Morpheus had fled, and there were no wet footprints nor drops of sea-water on the floor, marking, as she had hoped, the way that her lord had taken. Not again did Sleep visit her that night. A grey, cold morning dawned and found her on the seashore. As ever, her eyes sought the far horizon, but no white sail, a messenger of hope, was there to greet her. Yet surely she saw something--a black speck, like a ship driven on by the long oars of mariners who knew well the path to home through the watery ways. From far away in the grey it hasted towards her, and then there came to Halcyone the knowledge that no ship was this thing, but a lifeless body, swept onwards by the hurrying waves. Nearer and nearer it came, until at length she could recognise the form of this flotsam and jetsam of the sea. With heart that broke as she uttered the words, she stretched out her arms and cried aloud: "O Ceyx! my Beloved! is it thus that thou returnest to me?" To break the fierce assaults of sea and of storm there had been built out from the shore a mole, and on to this barrier leapt the distraught Halcyone. She ran along it, and when the dead, white body of the man she loved was still out of reach, she prayed her last prayer--a wordless prayer of anguish to the gods. "Only let me get near him," she breathed. "Grant only that I nestle close against his dear breast. Let me show him that, living or dead, I am his, and he mine forever." And to Halcyone a great miracle was then vouchsafed, for from out of her snowy shoulders grew snow-white pinions, and with them she skimmed over the waves until she reached the rigid body of Ceyx, drifting, a helpless burden for the conquering waves, in with the swift-flowing tide. As she flew, she uttered cries of love and of longing, but only strange raucous cries came from the throat that had once only made music. And when she reached the body of Ceyx and would fain have kissed his marble lips, Halcyone found that no longer were her own lips like the petals of a fair red rose warmed by the sun. For the gods had heard her prayer, and her horny beak seemed to the watchers on the shore to be fiercely tearing at the face of him who had been king of Thessaly. [Illustration: A GREY COLD MORNING FOUND HER ON THE SEASHORE] Yet the gods were not merciless--or, perhaps, the love of Halcyone was an all-conquering love. For as the soul of Halcyone had passed into the body of a white-winged sea-bird, so also passed the soul of her husband the king. And for evermore Halcyone and her mate, known as the Halcyon birds, defied the storm and tempest, and proudly breasted, side by side, the angriest waves of the raging seas. To them, too, did the gods grant a boon: that, for seven days before the shortest day of the year, and for seven days after it, there should reign over the sea a great calm in which Halcyone, in her floating nest, should hatch her young. And to those days of calm and sunshine, the name of the Halcyon Days was given. And still, as a storm approaches, the white-winged birds come flying inland with shrill cries of warning to the mariners whose ships they pass in their flight. "Ceyx!" they cry. "Remember Ceyx!" And hastily the fishermen fill their sails, and the smacks drive homeward to the haven where the blue smoke curls upwards from the chimneys of their homesteads, and where the red poppies are nodding sleepily amongst the yellow corn. * * * * * _Note._--The kingfisher is commonly known as the real "Halcyon" bird. Of it Socrates says: "The bird is not great, but it has received great honour from the gods because of its lovingness; for while it is making its nest, all the world has the happy days which it calls halcyonidæ, excelling all others in their calmness." ARISTÆUS THE BEE-KEEPER "... Every sound is sweet; Myriads of rivers hurrying thro' the lawn, The moan of doves in immemorial elms, And murmuring of innumerable bees." Tennyson. In the fragrance of the blossom of the limes the bees are gleaning a luscious harvest. Their busy humming sounds like the surf on a reef heard from very far away, and would almost lull to sleep those who lazily, drowsily spend the sunny summer afternoon in the shadow of the trees. That line of bee-hives by the sweet-pea hedge shows where they store their treasure that men may rob them of it, but out on the uplands where the heather is purple, the wild bees hum in and out of the honey-laden bells and carry home their spoils to their own free fastnesses, from which none can drive them unless there comes a foray against them from the brown men of the moors. How many of us who watch their ardent labours know the story of Aristæus--he who first brought the art of bee-keeping to perfection in his own dear land of Greece, and whose followers are those men in veils of blue and green, that motley throng who beat fire-irons and create a hideous clamour in order that the queen bee and her excited followers may be checked in their perilous voyagings and beguiled to swarm in the sanctuary of a hive. Aristæus was a shepherd, the son of Cyrene, a water nymph, and to him there had come one day, as he listened to the wild bees humming amongst the wild thyme, the great thought that he might conquer these busy workers and make their toil his gain. He knew that hollow trees or a hole in a rock were used as the storage houses of their treasure, and so the wily shepherd lad provided for them the homes he knew that they would covet, and near them placed all the food that they most desired. Soon Aristæus became noted as a tamer of bees, and even in Olympus they spoke of his honey as a thing that was food for the gods. All might have gone well with Aristæus had there not come for him the fateful day when he saw the beautiful Eurydice and to her lost his heart. She fled before the fiery protestations of his love, and trod upon the serpent whose bite brought her down to the Shades. The gods were angry with Aristæus, and as punishment they slew his bees. His hives stood empty and silent, and no more did "the murmuring of innumerable bees" drowse the ears of the herds who watched their flocks cropping the red clover and the asphodel of the meadows. Underneath the swift-flowing water of a deep river, the nymph who was the mother of Aristæus sat on her throne. Fishes darted round her white feet, and beside her sat her attendants, spinning the fine strong green cords that twine themselves round the throats of those who perish when their arms can no longer fight against the force of the rushing current. A nymph sang as she worked, an old, old song, that told one of the old, old tales of man's weakness and the power of the creatures of water, but above her song those who listened heard a man's voice, calling loudly and pitifully. The voice was that of Aristæus, calling aloud for his mother. Then his mother gave command, and the waters of the river rolled asunder and let Aristæus pass down far below to where the fountains of the great rivers lie. A mighty roar of many waters dinned in his ears as the rivers started on the race that was to bring them all at last to their restless haven, the Ocean. To Cyrene he came at length, and to her told his sorrowful tale: "To men who live their little lives and work and die as I myself--though son of a nymph and of a god--must do," he said, "I have brought two great gifts, oh my mother. I have taught them that from the grey olives they can reap a priceless harvest, and from me they have learned that the little brown bees that hum in and out of the flowers may be made slaves that bring to them the sweetest riches of which Nature may be robbed." "This do I already know, my son," said Cyrene, and smiled upon Aristæus. "Yet dost thou not know," said Aristæus, "the doom that has overtaken my army of busy workers. No longer does there come from my city of bees the boom of many wings and many busy little feet as they fly, swift and strong, hither and thither, to bring back to the hives their honeyed treasure. The comb is empty. The bees are all dead--or, if not dead, they have forsaken me forever." Then spoke Cyrene. "Hast heard, my son," she said, "of Proteus? It is he who herds the flocks of the boundless sea. On days when the South Wind and the North Wind wrestle together, and when the Wind from the East smites the West Wind in shame before him, thou mayst see him raise his snowy head and long white beard above the grey-green waves of the sea, and lash the white-maned, unbridled, fierce sea-horses into fury before him. Proteus only--none but Proteus--can tell thee by what art thou canst win thy bees back once more." Then Aristæus with eagerness questioned his mother how he might find Proteus and gain from him the knowledge that he sought, and Cyrene answered: "No matter how piteously thou dost entreat him, never, save by force, wilt thou gain his secret from Proteus. Only if thou canst chain him by guile as he sleeps and hold fast the chains, undaunted by the shapes into which he has the power to change himself, wilt thou win his knowledge from him." Then Cyrene sprinkled her son with the nectar of the deathless gods, and in his heart there was born a noble courage and through him a new life seemed to run. "Lead me now to Proteus, oh my mother!" he said, and Cyrene left her throne and led him to the cave where Proteus, herdsman of the seas, had his dwelling. Behind the seaweed-covered rocks Aristæus concealed himself, while the nymph used the fleecy clouds for her covering. And when Apollo drove his chariot across the high heavens at noon, and all land and all sea were hot as molten gold, Proteus with his flocks returned to the shade of his great cave by the sobbing sea, and on its sandy floor he stretched himself, and soon lay, his limbs all lax and restful, in the exquisite joy of a dreamless sleep. From behind the rocks Aristæus watched him, and when, at length, he saw that Proteus slept too soundly to wake gently he stepped forward, and on the sleep-drowsed limbs of Proteus fixed the fetters that made him his captive. Then, in joy and pride at having been the undoing of the shepherd of the seas, Aristæus shouted aloud. And Proteus, awaking, swiftly turned himself into a wild boar with white tusks that lusted to thrust themselves into the thighs of Aristæus. But Aristæus, unflinching, kept his firm hold of the chain. Next did he become a tiger, tawny and velvet black, and fierce to devour. And still Aristæus held the chain, and never let his eye fall before the glare of the beast that sought to devour him. A scaly dragon came next, breathing out flames, and yet Aristæus held him. Then came a lion, its yellow pelt scented with the lust of killing, and while Aristæus yet strove against him there came to terrify his listening ears the sound of fire that lapped up and thirstily devoured all things that would stand against it. And ere the crackle of the flames and their great sigh of fierce desire had ceased, there came in his ears the sound of many waters, the booming rush of an angry river in furious flood, the irresistible command of the almighty waves of the sea. Yet still Aristæus held the chains, and at last Proteus took his own shape again, and with a sigh like the sigh of winds and waves on the desolate places where ships become wrecks, and men perish and there is never a human soul to save or to pity them, he spoke to Aristæus. "Puny one!" he said, "and puny are thy wishes! Because thou didst by thy foolish wooing send the beautiful Eurydice swiftly down to the Shades and break the heart of Orpheus, whose music is the music of the Immortals, the bees that thou hast treasured have left their hives empty and silent. So little are the bees! so great, O Aristæus, the bliss or woe of Orpheus and Eurydice! Yet, because by guile thou hast won the power to gain from me the knowledge that thou dost seek, hearken to me now, Aristæus! Four bulls must thou find--four cows of equal beauty. Then must thou build in a leafy grove four altars, and to Orpheus and Eurydice pay such funeral honours as may allay their resentment. At the end of nine days, when thou hast fulfilled thy pious task, return and see what the gods have sent thee." "This will I do most faithfully, O Proteus," said Aristæus, and gravely loosened the chains and returned to where his mother awaited him, and thence travelled to his own sunny land of Greece. Most faithfully, as he had said, did Aristæus perform his vow. And when, on the ninth day, he returned to the grove of sacrifice, a sound greeted him which made his heart stop and then go on beating and throbbing as the heart of a man who has striven valiantly in a great fight and to whom the battle is assured. For, from the carcase of one of the animals offered for sacrifice, and whose clean white bones now gleamed in the rays of the sun that forced its way through the thick shade of the grove of grey olives, there came the "murmuring of innumerable bees." "Out of the eater came forth meat, out of the strong came forth sweetness." And Aristæus, a Samson of the old Greek days, rejoiced exceedingly, knowing that his thoughtless sin was pardoned, and that for evermore to him belonged the pride of giving to all men the power of taming bees, the glory of mastering the little brown creatures that pillage from the fragrant, bright-hued flowers their most precious treasure. PROSERPINE "Sacred Goddess, Mother Earth, Thou from whose immortal bosom, Gods, and men, and beasts have birth, Leaf and blade, and bud and blossom, Breathe thine influence most divine On thine own child, Proserpine. If with mists of evening dew Thou dost nourish those young flowers Till they grow, in scent and hue, Fairest children of the hours, Breathe thine influence most divine On thine own child, Proserpine." Shelley. The story of Persephone--of Proserpine--is a story of spring. When the sun is warming the bare brown earth, and the pale primroses look up through the snowy blackthorns at a kind, blue sky, almost can we hear the soft wind murmur a name as it gently sways the daffodils and breathes through the honey sweetness of the gold-powdered catkins on the grey willows by the river--"Persephone! Persephone!" Now once there was a time when there was no spring, neither summer nor autumn, nor chilly winter with its black frosts and cruel gales and brief, dark days. Always was there sunshine and warmth, ever were there flowers and corn and fruit, and nowhere did the flowers grow with more dazzling colours and more fragrant perfume than in the fair garden of Sicily. To Demeter, the Earth Mother, was born a daughter more fair than any flower that grew, and ever more dear to her became her child, the lovely Proserpine. By the blue sea, in the Sicilian meadows, Proserpine and the fair nymphs who were her companions spent their happy days. Too short were the days for all their joy, and Demeter made the earth yet fairer than it was that she might bring more gladness to her daughter Proserpine. Each day the blossoms that the nymphs twined into garlands grew more perfect in form and in hue, but from the anemones of royal purple and crimson, and the riotous red of geraniums, Proserpine turned one morning with a cry of gladness, for there stood before her beside a little stream, on one erect, slim stem, a wonderful narcissus, with a hundred blossoms. Her eager hand was stretched out to pluck it, when a sudden black cloud overshadowed the land, and the nymphs, with shrieks of fear, fled swiftly away. And as the cloud descended, there was heard a terrible sound, as of the rushing of many waters or the roll of the heavy wheels of the chariot of one who comes to slay. Then was the earth cleft open, and from it there arose the four coal-black horses of Pluto, neighing aloud in their eagerness, while the dark-browed god urged them on, standing erect in his car of gold. "'The coal-black horses rise--they rise, O mother, mother!' low she cries-- Persephone--Persephone! 'O light, light, light!' she cries, 'farewell; The coal-black horses wait for me. O shade of shades, where I must dwell, Demeter, mother, far from thee!'"[5] In cold, strong arms Pluto seized her--in that mighty grasp that will not be denied, and Proserpine wept childish tears as she shivered at his icy touch, and sobbed because she had dropped the flowers she had picked, and had never picked the flower she most desired. While still she saw the fair light of day, the little oddly-shaped rocky hills, the vineyards and olive groves and flowery meadows of Sicily, she did not lose hope. Surely the King of Terrors could not steal one so young, so happy, and so fair. She had only tasted the joy of living, and fain she would drink deeper in the coming years. Her mother must surely save her--her mother who had never yet failed her--her mother, and the gods. But ruthless as the mower whose scythe cuts down the seeded grass and the half-opened flower and lays them in swathes on the meadow, Pluto drove on. His iron-coloured reins were loose on the black manes of his horses, and he urged them forward by name till the froth flew from their mouths like the foam that the furious surf of the sea drives before it in a storm. Across the bay and along the bank of the river Anapus they galloped, until, at the river head, they came to the pool of Cyane. He smote the water with his trident, and downward into the blackness of darkness his horses passed, and Proserpine knew no more the pleasant light of day. "What ails her that she comes not home? Demeter seeks her far and wide, And gloomy-browed doth ceaseless roam From many a morn till eventide. 'My life, immortal though it be, Is nought,' she cries, 'for want of thee, Persephone--Persephone!'" So, to the great Earth Mother came the pangs that have drawn tears of blood from many a mortal mother's heart for a child borne off to the Shades. "'My life is nought for want of thee,-- Persephone! Persephone!'" ... The cry is borne down through the ages, to echo and re-echo so long as mothers love and Death is still unchained. Over land and sea, from where Dawn, the rosy-fingered, rises in the East, to where Apollo cools the fiery wheels of his chariot in the waters of far western seas, the goddess sought her daughter. With a black robe over her head and carrying a flaming torch in either hand, for nine dreary days she sought her loved one. And yet, for nine more weary days and nine sleepless nights the goddess, racked by human sorrow, sat in hopeless misery. The hot sun beat upon her by day. By night the silver rays from Diana's car smote her more gently, and the dew drenched her hair and her black garments and mingled with the saltness of her bitter tears. At the grey dawning of the tenth day her elder daughter, Hecate, stood beside her. Queen of ghosts and shades was she, and to her all dark places of the earth were known. "Let us go to the Sun God," said Hecate. "Surely he hath seen the god who stole away the little Proserpine. Soon his chariot will drive across the heavens. Come, let us ask him to guide us to the place where she is hidden." Thus did they come to the chariot of the glorious Apollo, and standing by the heads of his horses like two grey clouds that bar the passage of the sun, they begged him to tell them the name of him who had stolen fair Proserpine. "No less a thief was he," said Apollo, "than Pluto, King of Darkness and robber of Life itself. Mourn not, Demeter. Thy daughter is safe in his keeping. The little nymph who played in the meadows is now Queen of the Shades. Nor does Pluto love her vainly. She is now in love with Death." No comfort did the words of the Sun God bring to the longing soul of Demeter. And her wounded heart grew bitter. Because she suffered, others must suffer as well. Because she mourned, all the world must mourn. The fragrant flowers spoke to her only of Persephone, the purple grapes reminded her of a vintage when the white fingers of her child had plucked the fruit. The waving golden grain told her that Persephone was as an ear of wheat that is reaped before its time. Then upon the earth did there come dearth and drought and barrenness. "The wheat Was blighted in the ear, the purple grapes Blushed no more on the vines, and all the gods Were sorrowful ..." Lewis Morris. Gods and men alike suffered from the sorrow of Demeter. To her, in pity for the barren earth, Zeus sent an embassy, but in vain it came. Merciless was the great Earth Mother, who had been robbed of what she held most dear. "Give me back my child!" she said. "Gladly I watch the sufferings of men, for no sorrow is as my sorrow. Give me back my child, and the earth shall grow fertile once more." Unwillingly Zeus granted the request of Demeter. "She shall come back," he said at last, "and with thee dwell on earth forever. Yet only on one condition do I grant thy fond request. Persephone must eat no food through all the time of her sojourn in the realm of Pluto, else must thy beseeching be all in vain." Then did Demeter gladly leave Olympus and hasten down to the darkness of the shadowy land that once again she might hold, in her strong mother's arms, her who had once been her little clinging child. But in the dark kingdom of Pluto a strange thing had happened. No longer had the pale-faced god, with dark locks, and eyes like the sunless pools of a mountain stream, any terrors for Proserpine. He was strong, and cruel had she thought him, yet now she knew that the touch of his strong, cold hands was a touch of infinite tenderness. When, knowing the fiat of the ruler of Olympus, Pluto gave to his stolen bride a pomegranate, red in heart as the heart of a man, she had taken it from his hand, and, because he willed it, had eaten of the sweet seeds. Then, in truth, it was too late for Demeter to save her child. She "had eaten of Love's seed" and "changed into another." "He takes the cleft pomegranate seeds: 'Love, eat with me this parting day;' Then bids them fetch the coal-black steeds-- 'Demeter's daughter, wouldst away?' The gates of Hades set her free; 'She will return full soon,' saith he-- 'My wife, my wife Persephone.'" Ingelow. Dark, dark was the kingdom of Pluto. Its rivers never mirrored a sunbeam, and ever moaned low as an earthly river moans before a coming flood, and the feet that trod the gloomy Cocytus valley were the feet of those who never again would tread on the soft grass and flowers of an earthly meadow. Yet when Demeter had braved all the shadows of Hades, only in part was her end accomplished. In part only was Proserpine now her child, for while half her heart was in the sunshine, rejoicing in the beauties of earth, the other half was with the god who had taken her down to the Land of Darkness and there had won her for his own. Back to the flowery island of Sicily her mother brought her, and the peach trees and the almonds blossomed snowily as she passed. The olives decked themselves with their soft grey leaves, the corn sprang up, green and lush and strong. The lemon and orange groves grew golden with luscious fruit, and all the land was carpeted with flowers. For six months of the year she stayed, and gods and men rejoiced at the bringing back of Proserpine. For six months she left her green and pleasant land for the dark kingdom of him whom she loved, and through those months the trees were bare, and the earth chill and brown, and under the earth the flowers hid themselves in fear and awaited the return of the fair daughter of Demeter. And evermore has she come and gone, and seedtime and harvest have never failed, and the cold, sleeping world has awaked and rejoiced, and heralded with the song of birds, and the bursting of green buds and the blooming of flowers, the resurrection from the dead--the coming of spring. "Time calls, and Change Commands both men and gods, and speeds us on We know not whither; but the old earth smiles Spring after spring, and the seed bursts again Out of its prison mould, and the dead lives Renew themselves, and rise aloft and soar And are transformed, clothing themselves with change, Till the last change be done." Lewis Morris. FOOTNOTE: [5] Jean Ingelow. LATONA AND THE RUSTICS Through the tropic nights their sonorous, bell-like booming can be heard coming up from the marshes, and when they are unseen, the song of the bull-frogs would suggest creatures full of solemn dignity. The croak of their lesser brethren is less impressive, yet there is no escape from it on those evenings when the dragon-flies' iridescent wings are folded in sleep, and the birds in the branches are still, when the lilies on the pond have closed their golden hearts, and even the late-feeding trout have ceased to plop and to make eddies in the quiet water. "Krroak! krroak! krroak!" they go--"krroak! krroak! krroak!" It is unceasing, unending. It goes on like the whirr of the wheels of a great clock that can never run down--a melancholy complaint against the hardships of destiny--a raucous protest against things as they are. This is the story of the frogs that have helped to point the gibes of Aristophanes, the morals of Æsop, and which have always been, more or less, regarded as the low comedians of the animal world. Latona, or Leto, was the goddess of dark nights, and upon her the mighty Zeus bestowed the doubtful favour of his errant love. Great was the wrath of Hera, his queen, when she found that she was no longer the dearest wife of her omnipotent lord, and with furious upbraidings she banished her rival to earth. And when Latona had reached the place of her exile she found that the vengeful goddess had sworn that she would place her everlasting ban upon anyone, mortal or immortal, who dared to show any kindness or pity to her whose only fault had been that Zeus loved her. From place to place she wandered, an outcast even among men, until, at length, she came to Lycia. One evening, as the darkness of which she was goddess had just begun to fall, she reached a green and pleasant valley. The soft, cool grass was a delight to her tired feet, and when she saw the silvery gleam of water she rejoiced, for her throat was parched and her lips dry and she was very weary. By the side of this still pond, where the lilies floated, there grew lithe grey willows and fresh green osiers, and these were being cut by a crowd of chattering rustics. Humbly, for many a rude word and harsh rebuff had the dictum of Hera brought her during her wanderings, Latona went to the edge of the pond, and, kneeling down, was most thankfully about to drink, when the peasants espied her. Roughly and rudely they told her to begone, nor dare to drink unbidden of the clear water beside which their willows grew. Very pitifully Latona looked up in their churlish faces, and her eyes were as the eyes of a doe that the hunters have pressed very hard. "Surely, good people," she said, and her voice was sad and low, "water is free to all. Very far have I travelled, and I am aweary almost to death. Only grant that I dip my lips in the water for one deep draught. Of thy pity grant me this boon, for I perish of thirst." Harsh and coarse were the mocking voices that made answer. Coarser still were the jests that they made. Then one, bolder than his fellows, spurned her kneeling figure with his foot, while another brushed before her and stepping into the pond, defiled its clarity by churning up the mud that lay below with his great splay feet. Loudly the peasants laughed at this merry jest, and they quickly followed his lead, as brainless sheep will follow the one that scrambles through a gap. Soon they were all joyously stamping and dancing in what had so lately been a pellucid pool. The water-lilies and blue forget-me-nots were trodden down, the fish that had their homes under the mossy stones in terror fled away. Only the mud came up, filthy, defiling, and the rustics laughed in loud and foolish laughter to see the havoc they had wrought. The goddess Latona rose from her knees. No longer did she seem a mere woman, very weary, hungry and athirst, travelled over far. In their surprised eyes she grew to a stature that was as that of the deathless gods. And her eyes were dark as an angry sea at even. "Shameless ones!" she said, in a voice as the voice of a storm that sweeps destroyingly over forest and mountain. "Ah! shameless ones! Is it thus that thou wouldst defy one who has dwelt on Olympus? Behold from henceforth shalt thou have thy dwelling in the mud of the green-scummed pools, thy homes in the water that thy flat feet have defiled." As she spoke, a change, strange and terrible, passed over the forms of the trampling peasants. Their stature shrank. They grew squat and fat. Their hands and feet were webbed, and their grinning mouths became great, sad, gaping openings by which to swallow worms and flies. Green and yellow and brown were their skins, and when they would fain have cried aloud for mercy, from their throats there would come only the "_Krroak! krroak! krroak!_" that we know so well. And when, that night, the goddess of darkness was wrapped in peace in the black, silver star bespangled robe that none could take from her, there arose from the pond over which the grey willows hung, weeping, the clamour of a great lamentation. Yet no piteous words were there, only the incessant, harsh complaint of the frogs that we hear in the marshes. From that time the world went well with Latona. Down to the seashore she came, and when she held out her arms in longing appeal to the Ægean islands that lay like purple flowers strewn, far apart, on a soft carpet of limpid blue, Zeus heard her prayer. He asked Poseidon to send a dolphin to carry the woman he loved to the floating island of Delos, and when she had been borne there in safety, he chained the island with chains of adamant to the golden-sanded floor of the sea. And on this sanctuary there were born to Latona twin children, thereafter to be amongst the most famed of the deathless gods--the god and goddess, Apollo and Diana. "... Those hinds that were transformed to frogs Railed at Latona's twin-born progeny, Which after held the sun and moon in fee." Milton. Yet are there times, as we look at the squat, bronze bodies of the frogs--green-bronze, dark brown spotted, and all flecked with gold, the turned-down corners of their wistful mouths, their very exquisite black velvety eyes with golden rims--when the piteous croaks that come forth from their throats of pale daffodil colour do indeed awake a sympathy with their appeal against the inexorable decrees of destiny. "We did not know! We did not understand! Pity us! Ah, pity us! _Krroak! krroak! krroak!_" ECHO AND NARCISSUS In the solitudes of the hills we find her, and yet we may come on her unawares in the din of a noisy city. She will answer us where the waves are lashing themselves against the rugged cliffs of our own British coast, or we may find her where the great yellow pillars of fallen temples lie hot in the sun close to the vivid blue water of the African sea. At nightfall, on the lonely northern moors, she mimics the cry of a wailing bird that calls for its mate, but it is she who prolongs the roll of the great organ in a vast cathedral, she who repeats the rattle and crack and boom of the guns, no matter in what land the war may be raging. In the desolate Australian bush she makes the crash of the falling limb of a dead gum tree go on and on, and tortures the human being who is lost, hopelessly lost, and facing a cruel death, by repeating his despairing calls for help. Through the night, in old country-houses, she sports at will and gives new life to sad old tales of the restless dead who restlessly walk. But she echoes the children's voices as they play by the seashore or pick primroses in the woods in spring, and when they greet her with laughter, she laughs in merry response. They may fear her when the sun has gone down, and when they are left all alone they begin to dread her mockery. Yet the nymph who sought for love and failed to gain what she sought must surely find some comfort on those bright days of summer and of spring when she gives the little children happiness and they give her their love. When all the world was young, and nymphs and fauns and dryads dwelt in the forests, there was no nymph more lovely and more gay than she whose name was Echo. Diana would smile on her for her fleetness of foot when she followed her in the chase, and those whom she met in the leafy pathways of the dim, green woods, would pass on smiling at the remembrance of her merry chatter and her tricksy humour. It was an evil day for Echo when she crossed the path of Hera, queen of the gods. The jealous goddess sought her errant husband, who was amusing himself with some nymphs, and Echo, full of mischievous glee, kept her in talk until the nymphs had fled to safety. Hera was furious indeed when she found out that a frolicsome nymph had dared to play on her such a trick, and ruthlessly she spoke fair Echo's doom. "Henceforth," she said, "the tongue with which thou hast cheated me shall be in bonds. No longer wilt thou have the power to speak in greeting. To the tongues of others shall thy tongue be slave, and from this day until time shall cease thou shalt speak only to repeat the last words that have fallen on thine ears." A maimed nymph indeed was Echo then, yet whole in all that matters most, in that her merry heart was still her own. But only for a little while did this endure. Narcissus, the beautiful son of a nymph and a river god, was hunting in a lonely forest one day when Echo saw him pass. To her he seemed more fair than god or man, and once she had seen him she knew that she must gain his love or die. From that day on, she haunted him like his shadow, gliding from tree to tree, nestling down amongst thick fern and undergrowth, motionless as one who stalks a wild thing, watching him afar off while he rested, gladdening her eyes with his beauty. So did she feed her hungering heart, and sought to find contentment by looking on his face each day. To her at length came a perfect moment when Narcissus was separated from his companions in the chase and, stopping suddenly where the evening sun chequered the pathway of the forest with black and gold, heard the nymph's soft footfall on the rustling leaves. "Who's here?" he called. "_Here!_" answered Echo. Narcissus, peering amongst the trees' long shadows and seeing no one, called "Come!" And "_Come!_" called the glad voice of Echo, while the nymph, with fast-beating heart, felt that her day of happiness had come indeed. "Why do you shun me?" then called Narcissus. "_Why do you shun me?_" Echo repeated. "Let us join one another," said the lad, and the simple words seemed turned into song when Echo said them over. "_Let us join one another!_" she said, and not Eos herself, as with rosy fingers she turns aside the dark clouds of night, could be fairer than was the nymph as she pushed aside the leaves of the trackless wood, and ran forward with white arms outstretched to him who was lord of her life. [Illustration: SHE HAUNTED HIM LIKE HIS SHADOW] With cold eyes and colder heart the one she loved beheld her. "Away!" he cried, shrinking back as if from something that he hated. "_Away!_ I would rather die than that you should have me!" "_Have me!_" cried Echo pitifully, but she pled in vain. Narcissus had no love to give her, and his scorn filled her with shame. Thenceforth in the forest revels she never more was seen, and the nymphs danced gaily as ever, with never a care for her who had faded and gone away as completely as though she were a blossom in the passing of spring. In the solitude of mountain cliffs and caves and rocky places, and in the loneliest depths of the forest, Echo hid her grief, and when the winds blew through the dark branches of the trees at night, moaning and sighing, they could hear far below them the voice of Echo repeating their lamentations. For her, long nights followed hopeless days, and nights and days only told her that her love was all in vain. Then came a night when the winds no longer saw the figure of the nymph, white and frail as a broken flower, crouching close to of 212 degrees, Fahrenheit. But when you climb up mountains you come into a rarer and lighter atmosphere and water boils at considerably lower temperatures." "But I kept my potato kettle boiling very hard--" interrupted Jim; "I never stopped firing up under it." "That made no difference whatever in the amount of heat in it," answered the Doctor. "When water boils at all it is just as hot as fire can make it, unless it is shut completely off from contact with the air, as is the case in steamboilers. You can't make it any hotter no matter how much you may 'fire up' under the kettle." "Why, how's that?" asked "Little Tom," becoming interested. "The more fire you make in a stove the hotter the stove gets, and the hotter the room gets, too. Why isn't it the same way with a kettle of water?" "I'll explain that," said the Doctor, "and I think I can make you understand it. When water boils it gives off the vapor which we commonly call steam. That is to say, some of the water is converted by heat into vapor. It requires a great deal of heat to make the change from liquid to vapor and so the process of giving off steam cools the water. That is why you put a lid on a pot that you wish to boil quickly. You do it to check the cooling process by confining the vapor and preventing a too rapid conversion of water into steam." "Is that the reason that you can hold your hand in the steam from a kettle when you can't hold it in the water that the steam comes from," asked Jim. "Yes. The steam is really hotter than the water, but it needs all its own heat to keep it in the form of vapor, and so it doesn't give off enough heat to burn your hand after it gets a little way from the pot and begins to expand freely. Now as I was saying the harder you boil water the more steam it gives off and the heating and cooling processes are so exactly balanced that boiling water stands always at a uniform temperature no matter whether it is boiling hard as we say, or only just barely boiling. But in a dense atmosphere it requires more heat to boil water than it does in a rarefied atmosphere like that up here on the mountain. At Leadville and other places lying from 10,000 to 14,000 feet above sea level in the Rocky mountains you can't boil potatoes at all and it takes full ten minutes to boil an egg into that condition which we call 'soft.' It all depends upon the temperature of boiling water, and that is considerably lower here than down in the valleys where we live." "But Doctor," said Harry, "you promised to tell us how you find out how high we are above the sea level." The Doctor got up, went to a tree and took down a scientific instrument. "This," he said, "is an aneroid barometer. It measures the atmospheric pressure, and as that pressure steadily and pretty uniformly decreases as we go higher up, the instrument tells us at once how high we are." "But will it measure so accurately that you can trust it?" asked one of the now eagerly interested boys. "Let me show you," said the Doctor. "Make a torch, for it is growing dark, and come with me down the hill a little way. First look where the needle stands now." They all carefully observed the register and then proceeded with their mentor down the hill a little way. He there exhibited his instrument again and it registered fifty feet lower than it had done on the plateau above. Returning to the camp fire they found that the needle had resumed its former pointing. "Then you can tell by that instrument exactly how high you are at any time?" queried Jack. "No, not exactly. You see the atmospheric pressure varies somewhat with the weather even if you observe it always on the same level. One has to allow for that, but allowing for it we can tell by the instrument what our elevation is with something closely approaching accuracy." Just then came an interruption. A tall rough bearded, unkempt mountaineer, rifle in hand, stalked out of the woods and approached the camp fire. After inspecting the company and their belongings in silence for a time, he spoke a single word of question--"Huntin'?" "No," answered Jack, who had risen in all his length of limb. "Trappin'?" "No." "Jest campin' out?" "No," answered Jack, still adhering to that monosyllable. "Mout I ax then, what ye're a doin' of up here in the high mountings? You see us fellers what lives up here ain't over fond of strangers that comes potterin' round without explainin' of their selves." "Well" said Jack, "I don't see why I shouldn't tell you what brings us here. My mother owns a tract of timber land a little further around the mountain, and it is pretty much all she does own in the world. She's a widow, and she's had a pretty hard time to bring up three boys of us"--turning and indicating his two brothers--"and now we see a way of helping her. They're going to build a railroad down in the valley on the other side of this mountain, and they want railroad ties. So we have organized a party and come up here to chop down trees, make ties and send them down the mountain by a chute." "Um," answered the mountaineer. "What's them there things for?" pointing to the Doctor's scientific instruments hanging about on the trees. "They are scientific instruments, if you know what that means," answered Jack, who was beginning to grow irritable under the intruder's impertinent questioning. "What are you goin' to do with 'em? Will they help you to chop wood?" "No, of course not. But the Doctor here," indicating him, "is much interested in science and he has brought his instruments along so as to make our stay on the mountains as profitable as possible in the way of study." "My friend," broke in the Doctor, addressing the mountaineer, "If you will come to our camp when we get settled I'll show you how I use these things and what they tell me. One of them tells me how high up we are and when it's going to storm or clear away; another shows how fast the wind is blowing, another how cold it is and so on." "Which one on 'em tells the strength of whiskey and how much tax they ought to be paid on it?" This question was asked with a peculiar tone of sneering incredulity and suspicion. "Not one of them has any relation whatever to whiskey or taxes or anything of the sort," answered the Doctor. By this time Jack's patience was exhausted and by common consent Jack was the leader of the party. He turned to the tree behind him, seized his shot gun, presented it at the mountaineer's breast before that worthy could bring his rifle to his shoulder, and in an angry, but still cold voice, said: "I'll trouble you to lay down that rifle." The man obeyed. "Now I'll trouble you, if you please to lay down your powder horn and your bullet pouch and your cap box and everything else that pertains to that rifle." All this while Jack was holding the muzzle of his full-cocked, double barrelled shot gun in front of the man's breast, while all the other boys had seized their guns and stood ready for action. The Doctor had not a shot gun, but a repeating, magazine rifle of the latest make, long in its range, exceedingly accurate in its fire and equipped with fourteen cartridges in its magazine that could be fired as fast as their owner pleased. And the moment that the mountaineer, before he laid down his rifle, made a motion as if to bring it to his shoulder, the Doctor had stepped to Jack's side with his destructive weapon in position for instant use. After the man had laid down his arms, the Doctor stepped back, lowered his weapon and said to Jack:--"Manage the affair in your own way. Only be prudent, and above all don't lose your temper." Jack then said to the mountaineer: "You've asked us a number of questions. Now I want to ask you some. What do you mean by intruding upon our camp? Who are you? What right have you to ask us about ourselves and our mission in these mountains? Answer man, and answer quick or I'll put two charges of buck shot through you in less than half a minute." "Now, don't be too hard on a feller, pard," answered the man. "I didn't mean no harm in partic'lar. But you see us fellers that lives up here in the high mountings has a hard enough time to git a livin' and we don't like to be interfered with by no revenue officers and no spies and no speculators from down below. You see if we're caught, some of the money goes to the informer, an' so we takes good keer to have no informers about, an' if they insist on stayin' we usually buries 'em. Now you've got the drap on me an' my only chance is to go way if you'll let me go. So far as I'm concerned you're welcome to go round the mounting an' chop all the railroad ties an' cordwood you choose. But there's fellers in the mountings that you ain't got no drap on, as you've got it on me, an' fellers what ain't so tender hearted as me. An' so, while I'll leave my gun an' promise never to meddle with you again if you won't shoot, at the same time my earnest, friendly, fatherly advice to you boys is to take yourselves down out'n this mounting jes' as quick as you kin. It ain't no place for people of your sort." "We'll do nothing of the kind," answered Jack. "We've come up here on a perfectly honest and legitimate mission, and we're going to carry it out. We are not interfering with anybody and I give you warning that if anybody interferes with us it will be the worse for him. We are armed, every man of us and we are prepared to use our arms. Tom,"--turning to his brother,--"take that man's rifle and discharge it into the cliff back there." Tom obeyed the command instantly. Then Jack said to their unwelcome visitor, "Now you can take your rifle and go away. But don't intrude upon us again. If you do, you'll get the contents of our guns without any explanations or any arguments. Take your gun and go!" The intruder took his gun and accoutrements and without a word walked away up the mountain through the timber land. "What does it all mean, Jack?" asked all the boys at once. "Moonshiners," broke in Tom, sententiously. Moonshiners are men who operate little unlicensed distilleries in the fastnesses of the mountains and surreptitiously sell their whiskey without paying the government tax upon it. "But why should moonshiners object to our camping in the wood lands up here and cutting railroad ties?" asked Jim Chenowith. "I don't see the connection." "Well, they do," answered Tom. "They are engaged in a criminal business and they don't want to be watched. If they are caught their stills and their whiskey are confiscated, they are fined heavily, and worse still they are imprisoned for very long terms. They are always on the lookout for agents of the revenue in disguise, and so they don't want any strangers in this 'land of the sky' on any pretence. They are desperate men to whom murder is a pastime and assassination an amusement." "Then why did you anger the man as you did, Jack, and subject him to humiliation?" asked Ed Parmly. "Won't it make him and his people our enemies?" "No," answered Jack. "They are that already. You remember that even after hearing my explanation of our purpose in coming up here, he ordered us to leave the mountain at once. Not being a pack of cowards of course we're not going to do anything of the kind. So it was just as well to let him know at once that we're going to stay, that we are fully armed, and that in the event of necessity we shall be what he would call 'quick on trigger.' I meant him to understand that clearly, and he understands it. You see men that are freest in killing other men have no more fondness than people generally for being killed themselves. Desperadoes are not heroes. They are merely bullies who take advantage of an unarmed enemy when they can and sneak away as that man did whenever an enemy 'gits the drap' on them as the fellow phrased it." "But won't they attack us in our camp?" asked Jim Chenowith. "Probably," answered Jack with perfect calmness. "They want us out of the mountains and they'll probably try to drive us out. But I for one am not going to be driven out, and I don't think the rest of you fellows are Molly Cottontails to be chased down the steeps." "No!" called out little Tom. "We've got guns and we know how to use them. We're up here by right and here we'll stay. Won't we boys?" "Yes! Yes! Yes!" answered the others in chorus. "All right then," said Jack, "and I thank you all. But now that we know our danger we must look out for ourselves. We must never sleep without a sentinel on guard, and every fellow of us must always sleep with his gun by his side. That's what soldiers call 'sleeping on arms!'" "All right!" called out Tom, who was always ready. "Arrange the guard detail for to-night Jack. I'll take the worst turn, which I believe begins about three o'clock--the 'dog watch' they call it on steamboats." "Well," said Jack, meditatively. "It's now nearly ten o'clock. We'll all be up by six in the morning. That's eight hours and there are five of us; so it means one hour and thirty-six minutes apiece, of guard duty." "Hold on," broke in the Doctor. "You've forgotten me." "Well you see, Doctor, your health isn't good, and we don't want you to lose your sleep. We'll do all this guard duty without bothering you." "Not if I know it," answered the Doctor. "I didn't join this party as a dead head, you may be sure of that. I'm going to share and share alike with you my comrades. I am not yet very strong after my long illness, but I'm strong enough to stay awake for my fair share of the time, and you may be sure I am strong enough to pull a trigger and empty fourteen bullets from my magazine rifle into any body that may venture to assail us. Now boys, I want you to understand my position and attitude clearly. Either I am a full member of this company in good standing, or else I do not belong to it at all. In the latter case I'll withdraw and go back down the mountain. I'm older than you boys, but not enough older to make any serious difference. I'm still a good deal of a boy, and either you must let me do a boy's part or I'll quit. If I stay with you I must be one of you. I must do my share of the cooking and all the rest of the work, and especially my fair share of all guard duty and all fighting, if fighting becomes necessary at any time. Come now! Is it a bargain? Or am I to quit your company to-morrow morning, as a man too old and unfit to share with you the work we have come up the mountain to do?" "I move," said little Tom, who had more wit than any other member of the company, "that Doctor LaTrobe be hereby declared to be precisely sixteen years old, and fully entitled to consider himself a boy among boys!" The motion was carried with a shout, and then Jack, who was always practical, said: "Well then there are six of us. That means one hour and twenty minutes apiece of guard duty to-night." So it was arranged, and as soon as the order in which the several members of the party should be waked for duty was arranged, the boys piled an abundance of wood on the fire, wrapped themselves in their blankets and lay down to sleep. But first little Tom manufactured a pot of fresh coffee, and set it near the fire where it would keep hot. "The sentinel must be wide awake," he said, "and I don't know anything like good strong coffee to keep one's eyes open." CHAPTER II _A Picket Shot_ The three Ridsdale boys and their comrades lived in a thriving, bustling little town in one of the great valleys which divide the Virginia Mountains into ranges each having its own name. Their ages ranged from Jack's nineteen years down to Jim Chenowith's sixteen. Little Tom was so called not so much because he was rather shorter than his overgrown brothers, as because his father had been also Thomas Ridsdale and for the sake of distinguishing between them the family and the neighbors had from his infancy called the boy "Little Tom." He was next to Jack in age being now nearly eighteen years old, and as a voracious reader and a singularly keen observer he was perhaps better informed than any other boy in the party. He was not really little by any means, being five feet seven inches high and of unusually stalwart frame. From his tenth year till now he had spent his vacations mainly in hunting in these mountains. His knowledge of wood craft and of all that pertains to the chase was therefore superior even to Jack's. The father of the Ridsdale boys had been the foremost young lawyer in the town, but he had died at a comparatively early age, leaving his widow a very scanty estate with which to bring up the three boys who were her treasures. The boys had helped from the earliest years in which they were capable of helping. They had chopped and sawed and split wood, worked in the hay fields, dropped and covered corn, pulled fodder and done what ever else there was to do that might bring a little wage to eke out the good mother's scant income. In brief they had behaved like the brave, manly, mother-loving fellows that they were, and they had grown into a sturdy strength that promised stalwart manhood to all of them. Among the widow's meagre possessions was a vast tract of almost worthless timber land up there on the mountain. It was almost worthless simply because there was no market for the timber that grew upon it. But now had come the railroad enterprise, whose contractors wanted ties and bridge timbers and unlimited cordwood for use in their engine furnaces. So Jack and his brothers had decided to omit this winter's attendance upon the High school, and to devote the season to the profitable work of wood chopping on the mountain. There was an exceedingly steep descent on that side of the mountain, on which their timber lands lay, so that by building a short chute to give a headway they could send their railroad ties and the other products of their chopping by a steep slide to the valley below by force of gravity and without any hauling whatever. Two of their schoolmates--Jim Chenowith and Ed Parmly had asked to join in the expedition. An arrangement had been made with the railroad people to pay a stipulated price for every railroad tie shot down the hill, a much higher price for every piece of timber big enough for use in bridge building and a fair price for all the cordwood sent down the chute. This latter was to be made of the limbs of trees cut down for ties or bridge timbers--limbs not large enough for other uses, and which must otherwise go to waste. The two boys who did not belong to the Ridsdale family--Ed Parmly and Jim Chenowith--were to pay to Mrs. Ridsdale a small price agreed upon for each tie or timber, or cord of wood that they should cut on her land, the rest of the price going to themselves. During the last week before their departure Dr. LaTrobe had asked the privilege of joining the expedition. He was a man of means whose home was in Baltimore, but who had come to the town in which the boys lived in search of health and strength. He was a tireless student of science, and in the course of his duty in one of the charity hospitals of Baltimore he had contracted a fever. His recovery from it was so slow and unsatisfactory that he had abandoned his work and wandered away into South Western Virginia for purposes of recuperation and had been for some months boarding with Mrs. Ridsdale. In pursuit of health and strength therefore he asked to join the Ridsdale boys in their mountain expedition. "I have quite all the money I want," he explained, "and so the ties and timbers and cordwood that I may cut will be counted as your own. All I want is the life in the open air, the exercise, the freedom, the health-giving experience of a camping trip." Thus it was that the party had come together. They knew perfectly that once in the mountains after winter should set in in earnest their communication with the country below must be very uncertain. They therefore, took with them on their own backs and on the backs of their pack mules those necessaries which would most certainly render them independent of other sources of supply. The Doctor had largely directed the selection of food stuffs, bringing to bear upon it an expert knowledge which the boys, of course, did not possess. "The basis will be beans," he said. "But why beans?" asked Jack. "For several reasons. First, because beans will keep all winter. Second, because beans are very nearly perfect food for robust people. They have fat in them, and that makes heat, and they have starch and gluten in them too, so that they are in fact both meat and bread. Pound for pound, dried beans are about the most perfect food possible. To make them palatable we must take some dry salted pork along. We can carry that better than pickled pork in kegs and we shall not have to carry a lot of useless brine if we take the dry salted meat." The Doctor added some dried beef, a few hams, some bacon and a supply of sugar. "Sugar," he explained, "is almost pure nutriment. It is food so concentrated that it ought never to be taken in large quantities in its pure state." "That's why they were so stingy with me in the matter of candy when I was a little chap," soliloquized Tom. The total supply of meat taken along was small, but it was quite well understood that the party must rely upon its guns mainly for that part of its food supply. For bread there was a small quantity of "hard tack" and a large supply of corn meal. The salt was securely encased in a water-tight and even moisture-proof oil-cloth bag. One big cheese was taken by special request of Ed's mother, who had made it a year before, and the Doctor approved its inclusion in the list. "It weighs fifty pounds," he said to Jack who from the first had charge of the expedition, "but it is pure food and we couldn't put in fifty pounds of any thing else that would go so far to ward off starvation in case we get into difficulties. Next to a supply of coffee, nothing could be more useful." There were only four pack mules to carry these things, but every member of the party carried a heavy pack on his shoulders, besides his gun and axe, so that altogether the expedition was reasonably well provisioned, in view of the fact that it was going into the mountains where game of every kind abounded. No provender was carried for the pack mules. There was grass enough for them to live upon during the journey of two days and at the end of that time they were to be turned loose to find their own way down the mountain, cropping grass and herbs as they went. There was a grind stone for the sharpening of the axes, and one of the boys carried a long cross-cut saw. The ammunition supply was large, and besides cartridges loaded with turkey shot it included several scores that carried full sized buck shot. The ammunition, added to the rest, very seriously over-loaded the mules. On a long journey those animals, large and brawny as they were, could not have endured the burdens laid upon them. But the trip up the mountain was to occupy a good deal less than two days and so the owner of the mules readily consented to the overloading. That is how it came about that the five boys and Doctor LaTrobe were camping up there in a little mountain glade, on the night on which our story opens. They had less than a mile to go on the next day in order to reach their permanent camping place, but the journey was mainly a very steep up-hill one, and, their halt on the mountain side was in every way wise. Healthily weary as they were it did not take the boys long to fall asleep after they had wrapped themselves in their blankets and lain down with feet toward the great blazing fire. It was understood that the one on sentry duty should replenish the fire from time to time, but at Jack's wise suggestion the sentry was himself to remain well away from the blazing logs, and in the shadow of the woodlands beyond. "Otherwise," explained Jack, "an enemy approaching in the dark might easily pick off our sentry, sitting or standing in the firelight, and then slip away in the darkness without the possibility of our seeing him." The hours wore away, however, with no disturbance in the camp. One after another sentry aroused his successor and himself lay down to sleep. It was nearing daybreak, and little Tom was on duty. There was already a rime of white frost on the grass and leaves and the atmosphere was chill. Tom looked longingly at the great blazing fire as he walked his beat in the woodland shadows far beyond reach of its comforting radiance. "Any how this snappy air keeps a fellow from sleeping on post," he said to himself, "and they punish that crime with death in the army. Whew! how my ears ache! "What's that?" he ejaculated under his breath as he heard a stealthy noise. Listening he heard a sound as of some one creeping up through the woods. He cocked both barrels of his shot gun, each of which carried nine buck shot, and breathlessly waited, listening and looking. Presently he fired, and instantly every member of the party was on his feet, gun in hand, for they were all sleeping with their pieces beside them. "What is it?" "Where is it?" "Who is it?" and so on with question after question they bombarded little Tom. "It's breakfast," said little Tom, calmly walking to the foot of a tree and there picking up a fat opossum. There was a laugh, for half asleep as the boys were they saw the humor of the situation and realized under what a nervous strain they had been sleeping. "Now go to sleep again," said Tom, "and when I wake you next time breakfast will be ready." He went away into the woods and there dressed the opossum. Then he so far disregarded orders as to go to the fire and rig up a device for cooking the dainty animal. He cut two forked sticks, sharpened their lower ends and drove them firmly into the earth. Across these he laid another stick and from it he hung the opossum by a bit of twine which he twisted till it set and kept the roast revolving. Then he returned to the shadows, but every now and then he came back to the fire to inspect his roast and to set the string twirling anew. Finally, just as day was breaking, little Tom aroused the rest with a demand that some of them should make some bread, brew some coffee and "make themselves generally useful," as he phrased it. The sun was not yet up when the last bones of the pig-like little animal were picked clean and the final drop of coffee was drunk. CHAPTER III _The Doctor's Plans_ The little company had only a mile, or a trifle more, to go before reaching their final destination. But it was literally "up hill work." Often it was worse even than that, involving the climbing of cliffs and difficult struggles to force the mules through rocky and tangled woodlands. It was nearly ten o'clock therefore when they at last came to a halt in a body of thick-growing timber, and after a careful inspection of the situation, decided to pitch their permanent camp there. There were many points to be considered in locating themselves. They must have water of course and there was a spring here under the cliff that rose at the back of the plateau. It needed some digging out to form a basin, but an hour's or two hours' work by two of the party would accomplish that. They must be near the cliff on the other side over which their ties and timbers were to be sent into the slide that was to carry them to the valley below, and this spot seemed the best of all for the purpose. Finally the timber, consisting chiefly of vigorous young oaks, hickories and chestnuts, but having many giant trees besides, was here especially dense in its growth, and ready to their hands and axes. "There's a steep reach of mountain looming up just behind us," said the Doctor, "and when the snows come it may give us some trouble in the way of avalanches, floods and the like, but on the whole I think this is the best spot we could select." So the pack mules were relieved of their loads, and turned loose. It was certain that the sagacious animals would slowly retrace the road over which they had come and return to their master in the valley below. At any rate the master of them was confident of that and his agreement with the boys had been that the mules should simply be turned loose when their task was done. "Now let's all get together," said Jack Ridsdale when the mules disappeared over the edge of the last troublesome ascent. "Let's all get together and lay out our work." "That's right," said the Doctor. "We must first of all provide for immediate needs, and next for a permanent camp. Now first, what are our immediate needs?" "Water, fire, and a temporary shelter," promptly answered little Tom the readiest thinker as well as the most experienced woodsman in the whole company. "Well we'll set two fellows at work digging out a large basin for that spring," said Jack. "That will give us an adequate water supply for all winter. You Tom, and Ed Parmly, are detailed to that work. Now as to shelter. Of course we've got to build a permanent winter quarters. But that will take several days--perhaps a week, and in the meantime we're likely to have snows or rains and we must have some sort of temporary abode. We must build that to-day. How shall it be done?" "Easy enough," answered Harry Ridsdale. "We can set up some poles just under the cliff back there and make a shed open in front and covered with bushes so arranged as to shed the rain. Of course the place wouldn't be a good one for permanent quarters, but in November there are no avalanches or anything else of that sort, and so a temporary shed there will answer our purpose for the present." "But how are we going to keep it warm?" asked Ed. "By building a big fire in front of it," answered Harry. "But suppose the wind should blow hard from the north and blow all the smoke into our shed?" said Ed. "Well, let it," answered Harry. "The smoke will rise, especially in a high wind, and our bush roof will certainly be porous enough to let it through." After a little further discussion it was decided to adopt Harry's plan, and by the time that Tom and Ed had completed the work of digging out a water reservoir, the rest of the party had constructed a temporary shelter under the cliff, quite sufficient for their immediate needs. By this time hunger--that always recurring condition--had seized upon them and they prepared a rather late dinner of squirrels that had been shot by one and another of the party on the journey. They were tired, too, and the need of rest was imperative. So they decided to do no more work that day, but to devote its remaining hours to the task of planning their winter quarters. First of all they selected a location for their winter house which the Doctor thought the avalanches and the floods from the mountains would not seriously inconvenience. The ground on which they were camping was a sort of plateau, with a cliff rising behind and with the steep mountain side falling away into the fathomless depths in front. The plateau embraced several acres of land, and it was fairly level; but the spot selected for winter quarters was a little knoll which rose above the general level very near the top of the steep front. By the time that all this had been accomplished night fell, and there was supper to get. After supper Jack said: "Now we've laid out our camp, but we haven't named it yet. With the enmity of the moonshiners already aroused, it's a venture--our staying here I mean--but we're going to make the venture. So I propose that we call this camp of ours 'Camp Danger,' or 'Camp Risk' or camp something else of the sort." "Why not call it 'Camp Venture?'" asked Harry. "Good! 'Camp Venture' it is," answered Ed Parmly and the Doctor in unison. "Let it be 'Camp Venture'" and, added the Doctor, "if we are up to our business we'll show our friends that 'Camp Venture' did not venture more than its members were able to carry out. I'll tell you what, boys, I'm going to keep a diary setting forth all our adventures, and when the thing is over and done for, I'm going to write a book about it." "Then we'll all be heroes of romance," said Jack. "Who'll be the villain of the piece?" "Not at all," answered the Doctor. "I shall use fictitious names for all of you and even for myself, so that nobody shall ever know who we are or who it was that lived and experienced and perhaps suffered in 'Camp Venture.' I'm not going to spoil you superb fellows by making public personages of you before your time. But I'm going to write a book about your doings and sayings, which will perhaps interest some other boys and help them to meet duty as it ought to be met." This story is the book that the Doctor wrote. CHAPTER IV _A New Declaration of Independence_ "Well," said little Tom long before supper, "if you fellows are too lazy to do any more work after an easy day like this, I am going out into the sunset to look for a turkey. I'm not fond of salt meat, and besides we've got to spare our salt pork against a time of need. I'll be back by supper time." With that he shouldered his gun, withdrew one of the buckshot cartridges, inserted one loaded for turkeys in its stead, and strolled away up the mountain side. An hour passed and little Tom did not return. Another hour went by and still no little Tom came. By this time darkness had set in and supper was ready. The boys were growing uneasy, but they comforted themselves with the thought that "Little Tom knows how to take care of himself, anyhow." So they sat down to their evening meal with a great fire crackling and glowing in front of their temporary shelter, and filling it with fierce light which completely blinded their eyes to everything in the gloom beyond. They had carelessly stacked their arms in a corner, a dozen feet beyond reach, and were chatting in a jolly way when suddenly there appeared before them the tall mountaineer of the night before. This time he was wilier than on his previous appearance. This time he levelled his gun at the party and quickly stepped between them and their arms. Then, with his rifle at his shoulder and his finger near the hair trigger that was set to go off at the very lightest touch, he called out: "You got the drap on me las' night, but now I've dun got the drap on you. Will you now git out'n this here mounting? I've dun give you notice that us fellers what lives up here don't want no visitors from down below. So throw up your hands and march right now, every one of you. I'll take keer o' your guns an' other things, an' I'm not a goin' to take this rifle from my shoulder till the last one of you is well started down the mounting. Come now! Git a move onto you!" At that moment a noise as of some heavy body falling was heard in the outer darkness just beyond the limits of the firelight. The next instant little Tom leaped upon the mountaineer's back grasped his throat with both hands and dragged him to earth. His rifle went off in the mélee, but fortunately the bullet had no billet and flattened itself against the side of the cliff. Of course the mountaineer was more than a match for little Tom and in a prolonged struggle would easily have got the better of him. But the other boys instantly came to their comrade's assistance and the intruder was quickly and completely overcome. He had received some ugly hurts in the encounter, among them a broken arm, but the Doctor dressed the wounds and meantime the man became placative in his mood. "I was about to shoot him," said little Tom, "but it isn't a pleasant thing to shoot a man even when you must, and so I thought of the other plan, and jumped on his back instead. I knew I couldn't hold him down by myself, but I knew you other fellows would come to my assistance, so I risked that mode of operations." "If you had shot him," said the Doctor, "you'd have been justified both in law and in morals." "Yes, I know that," said little Tom, "but I shouldn't have slept well afterwards and I'm fond of my sleep." "Well now eat your supper," said the Doctor, "and perhaps our friend the enemy here will join you in enjoying it." To the astonishment of all, the mountaineer eagerly replied: "Well, I don't keer if I do. I ain't et nothin' sence a very early breakfast, an' it wa'n't much of anything that I et then. As for the little scrimmage, I don't bear no malice when I gits hurt in a fair fight--least of all against a young chap like that. You see I had got the drap on you fellers, an' when he come up sort o' unexpected like and unbeknownst to me, he jist naterally took the drap on me. It was all fair an' right, an' I want to say I'm grateful to him for not usin' his gun. He could 'a shot me like a dog, an' he didn't." All this while the lean and hungry mountaineer was eating voraciously and in spite of his wounds with an eager relish. "How do you people live up here?" asked the Doctor. "You can't grow much in the way of crops. Do you generally have enough to eat?" "Well hardly to say generally. Sometimes we has, and more oftener we hasn't. You see our business is onsartain. That's why we don't like strangers prowlin' around in the mountings. Now I've got somethin' friendly like, to say to you fellers. Fust off I want to tell you _I'm_ not agoin' to bother you agin. I'm a believin' that you've come up here on a straight business. But there's others that ain't got so much faith as me. They'll make trouble for you if you stay. My advice to you is to git out'n the mountings jest as quick as you kin." "But my friend," said the Doctor, "Why should we leave the mountains? We are on land owned by the mother of my young friends here. We have come only to see if we can't get some money for her out of lands that have never paid her anything--not even earning the taxes that she has paid on them. Why shouldn't we stay here and do this? This is a free country, and--" "They's taxes in it," said the mountaineer, gritting his teeth, "an' they's jails for them that tries to carry on business without a payin' of the taxes. I don't call that no free country." "It would be idle to argue that question," replied the Doctor. "But we, at least, have nothing to do with the taxes. We are here to make a little money in a perfectly legitimate way, by hard work. We are not interfering with any body and we don't intend to interfere with any body. But we're going to stay here all winter and carry on our business." "Yes!" added Jack, "and if any body interferes with us it will be the worse for him." "Well, you're makin' of a mistake," said the mountaineer, "an' I give you friendly warnin'. As I done told you before, I believe you. I think you're dead straight. But there's them what ain't so charitable, as the preachers say. There's them that'll believe you're lyin', and 'll stick to that there belief till the cows come home, an' they'll make a mighty heap o' trouble fer you fellers ef you tries to stay here. They're men that won't be watched I tell you, and forty witnesses, all on their Bible oaths couldn't persuade 'em but what you're here to watch 'em. It's friendly advice I give you when I tells you to git out'n these mountings." "All right," broke in little Tom, "but while you're scattering friendly advice around suppose you advise your friends to let us alone. Tell them that little Tom Ridsdale proposes to shoot next time, and to shoot his buckshot barrel at that." Tom rose to his feet and added: "You and your people mean war. Very well. I for one, accept the issue. Hereafter it will be war, and in war every man shoots to do all the damage he can. I have a perfect right to be here on my mother's land, and here I am going to stay. If every other fellow in the party should start down the mountain this night, I would stay here alone to fight it out all winter. And every other fellow in our party feels just as I do. Go to your criminal friends and tell them that! But warn them that if they interfere with us we'll not wrestle with them, we'll shoot and we'll take no chance of missing. We'll shoot to produce effects. We'll never interfere with you or your friends, but you and your friends mustn't interfere with us. If you do, you'll get war and all you want of it. We've tried to do the right thing by you; and now I give you fair warning." "Well, all I've got to say," said the mountaineer, as he took his departure, "is jest this: You fellers has dealt fair with me, an' I'll deal fair with you. That boy that threw me down an' broke my arm mout just as easy have shot me through the body; an' then the tender way that the Doctor done up my arm! Why even a woman couldn't 'a' been tenderer like. Now I ain't got no quarrel with you fellers, an' that's why I'm advisin' you to git down out'n the mountings as soon as you kin. There's others, I tell you, an' they ain't soft hearted like me. They'll give you a heap o' trouble if you stay here." "Let them try it," answered little Tom. "Let them try it. Then we'll see who's who, and what's what. Now tell your friends what I've said to you. There! good night! I hope your arm will get well. If it doesn't, come over here and let the Doctor look at it." With that defiant farewell in his ears the mountaineer took his leave. "Was it prudent, Tom?" asked Ed Parmly, "to send that sort of defiant message to the moonshiners?" "Yes, quite prudent. We want them to know that we are here on our own business and not on theirs, at all. We want them to know that we propose to stay here whether they want us to do so or not. And finally, we want them to understand that any interference with us on their part, will mean war. I've simply issued a Declaration of Independence, and--" "And to it," called out Jim Chenowith, quoting, "we pledge our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor." "Now," said Jack, "from this hour forward we'll keep a sentinel always on duty, so that we may not be caught napping. During the daytime, of course, when we're chopping ties and timbers, we'll need no sentinels. We'll keep our guns within easy reach, and so every one of us will be a sentinel, but when night comes on we mustn't let anybody 'get the drap' on us as that fellow did to-night. By the way, Tom, did you get any game?" "Why, yes. I forgot all about that. I dropped it out there to tackle that mountaineer. I had carried and dragged it for weary miles, and I wonder at my forgetfulness." Without questioning him further two of the boys went off into that circle of darkness which seemed impenetrably black when looked at from the fireside, but which was light enough when they got within its environment. There they found a deer, weighing perhaps a hundred and fifty pounds, which little Tom had shot high up on the mountain and had laboriously dragged, in part, and carried on his shoulders in other part, all the way to camp. Tom was much too weary to attend to it, but there were eager hands to help, and while Tom slept, they dressed the venison, and when Tom waked in the morning, he found that he had been completely excused from sentry duty throughout the night. His toilsome hunt, his painful carrying of the deer, his nervous strain over the necessity of encountering the mountaineer, and pretty seriously injuring him, and above all, his rise in wrath and his deliverance of a new Declaration of Independence as a defiance to the mountaineers, had been decreed by unanimous vote of the party to be the full equivalent of sentry service, and so Tom had been permitted to sleep through all the hours till breakfast was served. CHAPTER V _The Building of a Cabin_ Jack routed out the entire party before daylight next morning and bade them "get breakfast quick and eat it in a hurry. We've got to begin our house to-day," he added. They were eager enough, for, apart from the frolic of house building, they knew how badly they should need a more secure shelter than their temporary abode could furnish, should rain or snow come, as was likely now at any time. Breakfast over, Jack took his axe and marked a number of trees for cutting. Most of them were trees nearly a foot in thickness--none under eight inches--and all were situated in the thickest growth of timber. "Why not choose trees farther out in the open?" asked Ed Parmly, "where they would be easier to get at and get out." "Because, if you will use your eyes, Ed, you'll see that out in the open, the trees taper rapidly from stump to top. I want trees that will yield at least one, and if possible, two logs apiece, with very little taper to them. Otherwise, our house will be lop-sided." "But I say, Jack, what causes the difference? Why do trees in the thick woods grow so much taller and straighter and of more uniform size than trees out in the open?" "Because every tree is continually hunting for sunlight and air," answered Jack. "Out in the open, each tree finds these easily and goes to work at once to put out its branches, about ten feet from the ground, and to make itself generally comfortable. But where the trees are crowded close together each has to struggle with all the rest for its share of sunlight and air. They do not waste their energies in putting out branches that they can do without, but just keep on growing straight up in search of the air and sunlight. So you see if you want long sticks you must go into the thick woods for them. Out there in that half open glade there isn't a single tree with a twenty-foot reach before you come to its branches, while the trees I have marked here in the thick woods will give us, most of them two logs apiece twenty-one feet long and with not more than three or four inches difference between their diameters at the butt and their diameters at the extreme upper end. It's a good deal so with men, by the way. Those that must struggle for a chance usually achieve the best results in the end." By this time the axes were all busy felling the marked trees, and within an hour or so they all lay upon the ground, trimmed of their branches, and cut into the required lengths of twenty-one feet each. Having felled his share of them, Jack went a little further into the woodlands, and began blocking out great chips from one after another big chestnut tree. Having blocked out these chips, Jack sat down and began to split them, observing the result in each case with care. Presently he satisfied himself and set to work to cut down the giant chestnut whose chip had yielded the best results. "What's all that for, Jack?" asked the Doctor. "Why did you split up those chips in that way, like a little boy with a new hatchet?" "I was hunting for some timber that isn't 'brash,'" answered Jack, "to make our clapboards out of." "What do you mean by 'brash?'" "Why, some timber splits easily and straight along its grain, while other wood breaks away slantwise across the grain. That last kind is called 'brash,' and, of course, it is of no account for clapboards. See here!" and with that he took up two of the big sample chips and illustrated his meaning by splitting them and showing the Doctor how one of them split straight with the grain, while the other showed no such integrity. "Oh, then, you're going to make clapboards out of this tree to roof our shanty with and to close up its gables." "I'm going to make clapboards for our roof," answered Jack, "but not for our gables. They'll be made of logs, in true mountain fashion." "But how is that possible?" eagerly asked the Doctor. "I'll show you when we come to build. I can't very well explain it in advance. And another thing, Doctor, you remember that we have only ten pounds or so of nails, all told." "That's true!" exclaimed the Doctor, almost in consternation. "We can't roof our house till somebody goes down the mountain and brings a supply." "That's where you are mightily mistaken, Doctor. There isn't a log cabin in these mountains that has a nail in its roof." "But how then are the clapboards held in place?" "That again is a thing I can show you far better than I can explain it without demonstration. But we must first get our clapboards, and if you'll go back to the camp and bring a cross cut saw, I'll have this giant of the forest laid low by the time you get back, and then you and I will cut it into four-foot lengths for clapboards." It should be explained that in the mountains of Virginia the word "clapboard" and the simpler word "board," mean something quite different from what they signify elsewhere. When the Virginia mountaineer speaks of a "board" or a "clapboard" he means a rough shingle, four feet long, simply split out of a piece of timber and not dressed in any way. When the Doctor returned with the cross cut saw, Jack first marked off ten feet of his great tree at the butt and the two set to work to sever it. "But you said we were to cut it into four-foot lengths," said the Doctor, as they began to pull the saw back and forth. "So we are," answered Jack, "after we saw off this butt. You see, the butt of a tree is always rather brash, and so we won't use that for clapboards. Besides, I've another use for it." "What?" asked the Doctor. "I'm going to dig it out into a big trough and make a bath tub out of it. You see, that spring up there under the cliff has a fine flow of water. I'll sink this trough in the ground, at a proper angle, and train the water into it. It will run in at one end and out at the other, continually, so we'll always have a fresh bath ready for any comer." "But will the boys relish a cold bath out of doors when the thermometer gets down into the small figures?" "Well they'd better. Little Tom is a crank on cold bathing in the morning, and if any fellow in the party doesn't relish that sort of thing, Tom will souse him in any how till he teaches him to like it. He won't do you that way, Doctor, of course, but--" "But why not? I need the tonic influence of cold morning baths more than anybody else in the party, and as soon as we get our bath tub in place I shall begin taking them. And more than that, I'll help little Tom in the work of dousing any boy in the party that neglects that hygienic regimen." Having sawed off the butt of this big tree, Jack went back to the house site and directed the boys as to the work of building. The forty sticks of timber already cut, when piled into a crib would make the body of a cabin nearly twenty feet square, allowing for the overlapping of the timbers, and about ten feet high under the eaves. Jack showed the boys how to notch the logs at their ends so as to hold them securely in place and so also as to let them lie very close together throughout their length. For, of course, without notching, each log would lie the whole thickness of another log above the timber below it. Having thus started the four in the work of building, he returned to the woods where he and the Doctor continued the work of sawing the big tree trunk into four-foot lengths. About noon the Doctor volunteered to go and prepare a roast venison dinner, and Jack proceeded to split the tree-lengths into sizes convenient for the riving of the clapboards. By the time that he had accomplished this, the Doctor whistled through his fingers to announce dinner, and every member of the party was eagerly ready for the savory meal, the very odor of which made their nostrils glad while they were washing their hands and faces in preparation for it. There were not many dishes included in it--only some sweet potatoes roasted in the ashes, and some big pones of black ash cake, to go with the great haunch of roast venison. Ash cake is a species of corn bread, consisting of corn meal mixed up with cold water and a little salt, and baked hard in a bed of hot ashes and hotter coals, and if any reader of this story has ever eaten ash cake, properly prepared, I need not tell him that there is no better kind of bread made anywhere--no, not even in Paris, a city that prides itself about equally upon its "pain"--bread,--and its paintings, of which it has the finest collections in all the world. Finally, there was the sauce--traditionally, the best in the world,--namely, hunger. Half a dozen young fellows high up on a mountain side, who had breakfasted before daylight and swung axes and lifted logs till midday, needed no highly-spiced flavoring to give savor to their meat. They ate like the healthy, hard working fellows that they were, and they had no fear of indigestions to follow their eating. After dinner the work of building went on apace. The main crib of the house was finished by noon of the next day, and the roof and gables only remained to be completed after that. This was to be done as follows: Logs to form the gables were cut, each a few feet shorter than the one below. Then poles six inches in diameter were cut to form a resting place for the clapboards, and were placed lengthwise the building, resting in notches in the steadily shortening gable timbers. The gable timbers were permitted, however, to extend two feet or so beyond the notches in which the lengthwise poles rested, and a second notch was cut in each end of each of them. When a row of clapboards was laid on the lengthwise poles, another lengthwise pole was placed on top to hold the clapboards in place, and this top pole rested in the outer notches of the gable logs, thus securely holding the roof in position, and as the clapboards overlapped each other as shingles do, the roof was rainproof. Meantime Jack had been riving clapboards with a fro. Does the reader know what a fro is? The dictionaries do not tell you in any adequate way, though in Virginia and throughout the south and the great west that implement has played an important part in enabling men to house themselves with clapboards or shingles for their roofs. So I must do the work that the dictionaries neglect. A fro is an iron or steel blade about eight or ten inches long, about three inches wide, a quarter of an inch thick at top, tapering to a very dull edge at bottom. In one end of it is an eye to hold a handle. The fro is used in splitting out clapboards and rough and it was not because of her own beauty, nor her husband's fame, nor their proud descent and the greatness of their kingdom, that the Queen of Thebes was arrogant in her pride. Very sure she was that no woman had ever borne children like her own children, whose peers were not to be found on earth nor in heaven. Even in our own day there are mortal mothers who feel as Niobe felt. But amongst the Immortals there was also a mother with children whom she counted as peerless. Latona, mother of Apollo and Diana, was magnificently certain that in all time, nor in eternity to come, could there be a son and daughter so perfect in beauty, in wisdom, and in power as the two that were her own. Loudly did she proclaim her proud belief, and when Niobe heard it she laughed in scorn. "The goddess has a son and a daughter," she said. "Beautiful and wise and powerful they may be, but I have borne seven daughters and seven sons, and each son is more than the peer of Apollo, each daughter more than the equal of Diana, the moon-goddess!" And to her boastful words Latona gave ear, and anger began to grow in her heart. Each year the people of Thebes were wont to hold a great festival in honour of Latona and her son and daughter, and it was an evil day for Niobe when she came upon the adoring crowd that, laurel-crowned, bore frankincense to lay before the altars of the gods whose glories they had assembled together to celebrate. "Oh foolish ones!" she said, and her voice was full of scorn, "am I not greater than Latona? I am the daughter of a goddess, my husband, the king, the son of a god. Am I not fair? am I not queenly as Latona herself? And, of a surety, I am richer by far than the goddess who has but one daughter and one son. Look on my seven noble sons! behold the beauty of my seven daughters, and see if they in beauty and all else do not equal the dwellers in Olympus!" And when the people looked, and shouted aloud, for in truth Niobe and her children were like unto gods, their queen said, "Do not waste thy worship, my people. Rather make the prayers to thy king and to me and to my children who buttress us round and make our strength so great, that fearlessly we can despise the gods." In her home on the Cynthian mountain top, Latona heard the arrogant words of the queen of Thebes, and even as a gust of wind blows smouldering ashes into a consuming fire, her growing anger flamed into rage. She called Apollo and Diana to her, and commanded them to avenge the blasphemous insult which had been given to them and to their mother. And the twin gods listened with burning hearts. "Truly shalt thou be avenged!" cried Apollo. "The shameless one shall learn that not unscathed goes she who profanes the honour of the mother of the deathless gods!" And with their silver bows in their hands, Apollo, the smiter from afar, and Diana, the virgin huntress, hasted to Thebes. There they found all the noble youths of the kingdom pursuing their sports. Some rode, some were having chariot-races, and excelling in all things were the seven sons of Niobe. Apollo lost no time. A shaft from his quiver flew, as flies a bolt from the hand of Zeus, and the first-born of Niobe fell, like a young pine broken by the wind, on the floor of his winning chariot. His brother, who followed him, went on the heels of his comrade swiftly down to the Shades. Two of the other sons of Niobe were wrestling together, their great muscles moving under the skin of white satin that covered their perfect bodies, and as they gripped each other, yet another shaft was driven from the bow of Apollo, and both lads fell, joined by one arrow, on the earth, and there breathed their lives away. Their elder brother ran to their aid, and to him, too, came death, swift and sure. The two youngest, even as they cried for mercy to an unknown god, were hurried after them by the unerring arrows of Apollo. The cries of those who watched this terrible slaying were not long in bringing Niobe to the place where her sons lay dead. Yet, even then, her pride was unconquered, and she defied the gods, and Latona, to whose jealousy she ascribed the fate of her "seven spears." "Not yet hast thou conquered, Latona!" she cried. "My seven sons lie dead, yet to me still remain the seven perfect lovelinesses that I have borne. Try to match them, if thou canst, with the beauty of thy two! Still am I richer than thou, O cruel and envious mother of one daughter and one son!" But even as she spoke, Diana had drawn her bow, and as the scythe of a mower quickly cuts down, one after the other, the tall white blossoms in the meadow, so did her arrows slay the daughters of Niobe. When one only remained, the pride of Niobe was broken. With her arms round the little slender frame of her golden-haired youngest born, she looked up to heaven, and cried upon all the gods for mercy. "She is so little!" she wailed. "So young--so dear! Ah, spare me _one_," she said, "only one out of so many!" But the gods laughed. Like a harsh note of music sounded the twang of Diana's bow. Pierced by a silver arrow, the little girl lay dead. The dignity of Latona was avenged. Overwhelmed by despair, King Amphion killed himself, and Niobe was left alone to gaze on the ruin around her. For nine days she sat, a Greek Rachel, weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they were not. On the tenth day, the sight was too much even for the superhuman hearts of the gods to endure. They turned the bodies into stone and themselves buried them. And when they looked on the face of Niobe and saw on it a bleeding anguish that no human hand could stay nor the word of any god comfort, the gods were merciful. Her grief was immortalised, for Niobe, at their will, became a stone, and was carried by a wailing tempest to the summit of Mount Sipylus, in Lydia, where a spring of Argos bore her name. Yet although a rock was Niobe, from her blind eyes of stone the tears still flowed, a clear stream of running water, symbol of a mother's anguish and never-ending grief. HYACINTHUS ... "The sad death Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath Of Zephyr slew him--Zephyr penitent Who now, ere Phœbus mounts the firmament, Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain." Keats. "Whom the gods love die young"--truly it would seem so, as we read the old tales of men and of women beloved of the gods. To those men who were deemed worthy of being companions of the gods, seemingly no good fortune came. Yet, after all, if even in a brief span of life they had tasted god-given happiness, was their fate one to be pitied? Rather let us keep our tears for those who, in a colourless grey world, have seen the dull days go past laden with trifling duties, unnecessary cares and ever-narrowing ideals, and have reached old age and the grave--no narrower than their lives--without ever having known a fulness of happiness, such as the Olympians knew, or ever having dared to reach upwards and to hold fellowship with the Immortals. Hyacinthus was a Spartan youth, son of Clio, one of the Muses, and of the mortal with whom she had mated, and from mother, or father, or from the gods themselves, he had received the gift of beauty. It chanced one day that as Apollo drove his chariot on its all-conquering round, he saw the boy. Hyacinthus was as fair to look upon as the fairest of women, yet he was not only full of grace, but was muscular, and strong as a straight young pine on Mount Olympus that fears not the blind rage of the North Wind nor the angry tempests of the South. When Apollo had spoken with him he found that the face of Hyacinthus did not belie the heart within him, and gladly the god felt that at last he had found the perfect companion, the ever courageous and joyous young mate, whose mood was always ready to meet his own. Did Apollo desire to hunt, with merry shout Hyacinthus called the hounds. Did the great god deign to fish, Hyacinthus was ready to fetch the nets and to throw himself, whole-souled, into the great affair of chasing and of landing the silvery fishes. When Apollo wished to climb the mountains, to heights so lonely that not even the moving of an eagle's wing broke the everlasting stillness, Hyacinthus--his strong limbs too perfect for the chisel of any sculptor worthily to reproduce--was ready and eager for the climb. And when, on the mountain top, Apollo gazed in silence over illimitable space, and watched the silver car of his sister Diana rising slowly into the deep blue of the sky, silvering land and water as she passed, it was never Hyacinthus who was the first to speak--with words to break the spell of Nature's perfect beauty, shared in perfect companionship. There were times, too, when Apollo would play his lyre, and when naught but the music of his own making could fulfil his longing. And when those times came, Hyacinthus would lie at the feet of his friend--of the friend who was a god--and would listen, with eyes of rapturous joy, to the music that his master made. A very perfect friend was this friend of the sun-god. Nor was it Apollo alone who desired the friendship of Hyacinthus. Zephyrus, god of the South Wind, had known him before Apollo crossed his path and had eagerly desired him for a friend. But who could stand against Apollo? Sulkily Zephyrus marked their ever-ripening friendship, and in his heart jealousy grew into hatred, and hatred whispered to him of revenge. Hyacinthus excelled at all sports, and when he played quoits it was sheer joy for Apollo, who loved all things beautiful, to watch him as he stood to throw the disc, his taut muscles making him look like Hermes, ready to spurn the cumbering earth from off his feet. Further even than the god, his friend, could Hyacinthus throw, and always his merry laugh when he succeeded made the god feel that nor man nor god could ever grow old. And so there came that day, fore-ordained by the Fates, when Apollo and Hyacinthus played a match together. Hyacinthus made a valiant throw, and Apollo took his place, and cast the discus high and far. Hyacinthus ran forward eager to measure the distance, shouting with excitement over a throw that had indeed been worthy of a god. Thus did Zephyrus gain his opportunity. Swiftly through the tree-tops ran the murmuring South Wind, and smote the discus of Apollo with a cruel hand. Against the forehead of Hyacinthus it dashed, smiting the locks that lay upon it, crashing through skin and flesh and bone, felling him to the earth. Apollo ran towards him and raised him in his arms. But the head of Hyacinthus fell over on the god's shoulder, like the head of a lily whose stem is broken. The red blood gushed to the ground, an unquenchable stream, and darkness fell on the eyes of Hyacinthus, and, with the flow of his life's blood, his gallant young soul passed away. "Would that I could die for thee, Hyacinthus!" cried the god, his god's heart near breaking. "I have robbed thee of thy youth. Thine is the suffering, mine the crime. I shall sing thee ever--oh perfect friend! And evermore shalt thou live as a flower that will speak to the hearts of men of spring, of everlasting youth--of life that lives forever." As he spoke, there sprang from the blood-drops at his feet a cluster of flowers, blue as the sky in spring, yet hanging their heads as if in sorrow.[4] [Illustration: DARKNESS FELL ON THE EYES OF HYACINTHUS] And still, when winter is ended, and the song of birds tell us of the promise of spring, if we go to the woods, we find traces of the vow of the sun-god. The trees are budding in buds of rosy hue, the willow branches are decked with silvery catkins powdered with gold. The larches, like slender dryads, wear a feathery garb of tender green, and under the trees of the woods the primroses look up, like fallen stars. Along the woodland path we go, treading on fragrant pine-needles and on the beech leaves of last year that have not yet lost their radiant amber. And, at a turn of the way, the sun-god suddenly shines through the great dark branches of the giants of the forest, and before us lies a patch of exquisite blue, as though a god had robbed the sky and torn from it a precious fragment that seems alive and moving, between the sun and the shadow. And, as we look, the sun caresses it, and the South Wind gently moves the little bell-shaped flowers of the wild hyacinth as it softly sweeps across them. So does Hyacinthus live on; so do Apollo and Zephyrus still love and mourn their friend. FOOTNOTE: [4] Legend says that on the petals of the hyacinth Apollo transcribed the letters "Aì,"--"Alas!" KING MIDAS OF THE GOLDEN TOUCH In the plays of Shakespeare we have three distinct divisions--three separate volumes. One deals with Tragedy, another with Comedy, a third with History; and a mistake made by the young in their aspect of life is that they do the same thing, and keep tragedy and comedy severely apart, relegating them to separate volumes that, so they think, have nothing to do with each other. But those who have passed many milestones on the road know that "_History_" is the only right label for the Book of Life's many parts, and that the actors in the great play are in truth tragic comedians. This is the story of Midas, one of the chief tragic comedians of mythology. Once upon a time the kingdom of Phrygia lacked a king, and in much perplexity, the people sought help from an oracle. The answer was very definite: "The first man who enters your city riding in a car shall be your king." That day there came slowly jogging into the city in their heavy, wooden-wheeled wain, the peasant Gordias and his wife and son, whose destination was the marketplace, and whose business was to sell the produce of their little farm and vineyard--fowls, a goat or two, and a couple of skinsful of strong, purple-red wine. An eager crowd awaited their entry, and a loud shout of welcome greeted them. And their eyes grew round and their mouths fell open in amaze when they were hailed as King and Queen and Prince of Phrygia. The gods had indeed bestowed upon Gordias, the low-born peasant, a surprising gift, but he showed his gratitude by dedicating his wagon to the deity of the oracle and tying it up in its place with the wiliest knot that his simple wisdom knew, pulled as tight as his brawny arms and strong rough hands could pull. Nor could anyone untie the famous Gordian knot, and therefore become, as the oracle promised, lord of all Asia, until centuries had passed, and Alexander the Great came to Phrygia and sliced through the knot with his all-conquering sword. In time Midas, the son of Gordias, came to inherit the throne and crown of Phrygia. Like many another not born and bred to the purple, his honours sat heavily upon him. From the day that his father's wain had entered the city amidst the acclamations of the people, he had learned the value of power, and therefore, from his boyhood onward, power, always more power, was what he coveted. Also his peasant father had taught him that gold could buy power, and so Midas ever longed for more gold, that could buy him a place in the world that no descendant of a long race of kings should be able to contest. And from Olympus the gods looked down and smiled, and vowed that Midas should have the chance of realising his heart's desire. Therefore one day when he and his court were sitting in the solemn state that Midas required, there rode into their midst, tipsily swaying on the back of a gentle full-fed old grey ass, ivy-crowned, jovial and foolish, the satyr Silenus, guardian of the young god Bacchus. With all the deference due to the friend of a god Midas treated this disreputable old pedagogue, and for ten days and nights on end he feasted him royally. On the eleventh day Bacchus came in search of his preceptor, and in deep gratitude bade Midas demand of him what he would, because he had done Silenus honour when to dishonour him lay in his power. Not even for a moment did Midas ponder. "I would have gold," he said hastily--"much gold. I would have that touch by which all common and valueless things become golden treasures." And Bacchus, knowing that here spoke the son of peasants who many times had gone empty to bed after a day of toilful striving on the rocky uplands of Phrygia, looked a little sadly in the eager face of Midas, and answered: "Be it as thou wilt. Thine shall be the golden touch." Then Bacchus and Silenus went away, a rout of singing revellers at their heels, and Midas quickly put to proof the words of Bacchus. An olive tree grew near where he stood, and from it he picked a little twig decked with leaves of softest grey, and lo, it grew heavy as he held it, and glittered like a piece of his crown. He stooped to touch the green turf on which some fragrant violets grew, and turf grew into cloth of gold, and violets lost their fragrance and became hard, solid, golden things. He touched an apple whose cheek grew rosy in the sun, and at once it became like the golden fruit in the Garden of the Hesperides. The stone pillars of his palace as he brushed past them on entering, blazed like a sunset sky. The gods had not deceived him. Midas had the Golden Touch. Joyously he strode into the palace and commanded a feast to be prepared--a feast worthy of an occasion so magnificent. But when Midas, with the healthy appetite of the peasant-born, would have eaten largely of the savoury food that his cooks prepared, he found that his teeth only touched roast kid to turn it into a slab of gold, that garlic lost its flavour and became gritty as he chewed, that rice turned into golden grains, and curdled milk became a dower fit for a princess, entirely unnegotiable for the digestion of man. Baffled and miserable, Midas seized his cup of wine, but the red wine had become one with the golden vessel that held it; nor could he quench his thirst, for even the limpid water from the fountain was melted gold when it touched his dry lips. Only for a very few days was Midas able to bear the affliction of his wealth. There was nothing now for him to live for. He could buy the whole earth if he pleased, but even children shrank in terror from his touch, and hungry and thirsty and sick at heart he wearily dragged along his weighty robes of gold. Gold was power, he knew well, yet of what worth was gold while he starved? Gold could not buy him life and health and happiness. In despair, at length he cried to the god who had given him the gift that he hated. "Save me, O Bacchus!" he said. "A witless one am I, and the folly of my desire has been my undoing. Take away from me the accursed Golden Touch, and faithfully and well shall I serve thee forever." Then Bacchus, very pitiful for him, told Midas to go to Sardis, the chief city of his worshippers, and to trace to its source the river upon which it was built. And in that pool, when he found it, he was to plunge his head, and so he would, for evermore, be freed from the Golden Touch. It was a long journey that Midas then took, and a weary and a starving man was he when at length he reached the spring where the river Pactolus had its source. He crawled forward, and timidly plunged in his head and shoulders. Almost he expected to feel the harsh grit of golden water, but instead there was the joy he had known as a peasant boy when he laved his face and drank at a cool spring when his day's toil was ended. And when he raised his face from the pool, he knew that his hateful power had passed from him, but under the water he saw grains of gold glittering in the sand, and from that time forth the river Pactolus was noted for its gold. One lesson the peasant king had learnt by paying in suffering for a mistake, but there was yet more suffering in store for the tragic comedian. He had now no wish for golden riches, nor even for power. He wished to lead the simple life and to listen to the pipings of Pan along with the goat-herds on the mountains or the wild creatures in the woods. Thus it befell that he was present one day at a contest between Pan and Apollo himself. It was a day of merry-making for nymphs and fauns and dryads, and all those who lived in the lonely solitudes of Phrygia came to listen to the music of the god who ruled them. For as Pan sat in the shade of a forest one night and piped on his reeds until the very shadows danced, and the water of the stream by which he sat leapt high over the mossy stones it passed, and laughed aloud in its glee, the god had so gloried in his own power that he cried: "Who speaks of Apollo and his lyre? Some of the gods may be well pleased with his music, and mayhap a bloodless man or two. But my music strikes to the heart of the earth itself. It stirs with rapture the very sap of the trees, and awakes to life and joy the innermost soul of all things mortal." Apollo heard his boast, and heard it angrily. "Oh, thou whose soul is the soul of the untilled ground!" he said, "wouldst thou place thy music, that is like the wind in the reeds, beside my music, which is as the music of the spheres?" And Pan, splashing with his goat's feet amongst the water-lilies of the stream on the bank of which he sat, laughed loudly and cried: "Yea, would I, Apollo! Willingly would I play thee a match--thou on thy golden lyre--I on my reeds from the river." Thus did it come to pass that Apollo and Pan matched against each other their music, and King Midas was one of the judges. First of all Pan took his fragile reeds, and as he played, the leaves on the trees shivered, and the sleeping lilies raised their heads, and the birds ceased their song to listen and then flew straight to their mates. And all the beauty of the world grew more beautiful, and all its terror grew yet more grim, and still Pan piped on, and laughed to see the nymphs and the fauns first dance in joyousness and then tremble in fear, and the buds to blossom, and the stags to bellow in their lordship of the hills. When he ceased, it was as though a tensely-drawn string had broken, and all the earth lay breathless and mute. And Pan turned proudly to the golden-haired god who had listened as he had spoken through the hearts of reeds to the hearts of men. "Canst, then, make music like unto my music, Apollo?" he said. Then Apollo, his purple robes barely hiding the perfection of his limbs, a wreath of laurel crowning his yellow curls, looked down at Pan from his godlike height and smiled in silence. For a moment his hand silently played over the golden strings of his lyre, and then his finger-tips gently touched them. And every creature there who had a soul, felt that that soul had wings, and the wings sped them straight to Olympus. Far away from all earth-bound creatures they flew, and dwelt in magnificent serenity amongst the Immortals. No longer was there strife, or any dispeace. No more was there fierce warring between the actual and the unknown. The green fields and thick woods had faded into nothingness, and their creatures, and the fair nymphs and dryads, and the wild fauns and centaurs longed and fought no more, and man had ceased to desire the impossible. Throbbing nature and passionately desiring life faded into dust before the melody that Apollo called forth, and when his strings had ceased to quiver and only the faintly remembered echo of his music remained, it was as though the earth had passed away and all things had become new. For the space of many seconds all was silence. Then, in low voice, Apollo asked: "Ye who listen--who is the victor?" And earth and sea and sky, and all the creatures of earth and sky, and of the deep, replied as one: "The victory is thine, Divine Apollo." Yet was there one dissentient voice. Midas, sorely puzzled, utterly un-understanding, was relieved when the music of Apollo ceased. "If only Pan would play again," he murmured to himself. "I wish to live, and Pan's music gives me life. I love the woolly vine-buds and the fragrant pine-leaves, and the scent of the violets in the spring. The smell of the fresh-ploughed earth is dear to me, the breath of the kine that have grazed in the meadows of wild parsley and of asphodel. I want to drink red wine and to eat and love and fight and work and be joyous and sad, fierce and strong, and very weary, and to sleep the dead sleep of men who live only as weak mortals do." Therefore he raised his voice, and called very loud: "Pan's music is sweeter and truer and greater than the music of Apollo. Pan is the victor, and I, King Midas, give him the victor's crown!" With scorn ineffable the sun-god turned upon Midas, his peasant's face transfigured by his proud decision. For a little he gazed at him in silence, and his look might have turned a sunbeam to an icicle. Then he spoke: "The ears of an ass have heard my music," he said. "Henceforth shall Midas have ass's ears." And when Midas, in terror, clapped his hands to his crisp black hair, he found growing far beyond it, the long, pointed ears of an ass. Perhaps what hurt him most, as he fled away, was the shout of merriment that came from Pan. And fauns and nymphs and satyrs echoed that shout most joyously. Willingly would he have hidden in the woods, but there he found no hiding-place. The trees and shrubs and flowering things seemed to shake in cruel mockery. Back to his court he went and sent for the court hairdresser, that he might bribe him to devise a covering for these long, peaked, hairy symbols of his folly. Gladly the hairdresser accepted many and many oboli, many and many golden gifts, and all Phrygia wondered, while it copied, the strange headdress of the king. But although much gold had bought his silence, the court barber was unquiet of heart. All day and all through the night he was tormented by his weighty secret. And then, at length, silence was to him a torture too great to be borne; he sought a lonely place, there dug a deep hole, and, kneeling by it, softly whispered to the damp earth: "King Midas has ass's ears." Greatly relieved, he hastened home, and was well content until, on the spot where his secret lay buried, rushes grew up. And when the winds blew through them, the rushes whispered for all those who passed by to hear: "King Midas has ass's ears! King Midas has ass's ears!" Those who listen very carefully to what the green rushes in marshy places whisper as the wind passes through them, may hear the same thing to this day. And those who hear the whisper of the rushes may, perhaps, give a pitying thought to Midas--the tragic comedian of mythology. CEYX AND HALCYONE "St. Martin's summer, halcyon days." _King Henry VI_, i. 2, 131. "Halcyon days"--how often is the expression made use of, how seldom do its users realise from whence they have borrowed it. "These were halcyon days," says the old man, and his memory wanders back to a time when for him "All the world is young, lad, And all the trees are green; And every goose a swan, lad, And every lass a queen." Yet the story of Halcyone is one best to be understood by the heavy-hearted woman who wanders along the bleak sea-beach and strains her weary eyes for the brown sail of the fishing-boat that will never more return. Over the kingdom of Thessaly, in the days of long ago, there reigned a king whose name was Ceyx, son of Hesperus, the Day Star, and almost as radiant in grace and beauty as was his father. His wife was the fair Halcyone, daughter of Æolus, ruler of the winds, and most perfectly did this king and queen love one another. Their happiness was unmarred until there came a day when Ceyx had to mourn for the loss of a brother. Following close on the heels of this disaster came direful prodigies which led Ceyx to fear that in some way he must have incurred the hostility of the gods. To him there was no way in which to discover wherein lay his fault, and to make atonement for it, but by going to consult the oracle of Apollo at Claros, in Ionia. When he told Halcyone what he must do, she knew well that she must not try to turn him from his solemn purpose, yet there hung over her heart a black shadow of fear and of evil foreboding that no loving words of assurance could drive away. Most piteously she begged him to take her with him, but the king knew too well the dangers of the treacherous Ægean Sea to risk on it the life of the woman that he loved so well. "I promise," he said, "by the rays of my Father the Day Star, that if fate permits I will return before the moon shall have twice rounded her orb." Down by the shore the sailors of King Ceyx awaited his coming, and when with passionately tender love he and Halcyone had taken farewell of each other, the rowers sat down on the benches and dipped their long oars into the water. With rhythmic swing they drove the great ship over the grey sea, while Ceyx stood on deck and gazed back at his wife until his eyes could no longer distinguish her from the rocks on the shore, nor could she any longer see the white sails of the ship as it crested the restless waves. Heavier still was her heart when she turned away from the shore, and yet more heavy it grew as the day wore on and dark night descended. For the air was full of the clamorous wailings of the fierce winds whose joy it is to lash the waves into rage and to strew with dead men and broken timber the angry, surf-beaten shore. "My King," she sighed to herself. "My King! my Own!" And through the weary hours she prayed to the gods to bring him safely back to her, and many times she offered fragrant incense to Juno, protectress of women, that she might have pity on a woman whose husband and true lover was out in the storm, a plaything for ruthless winds and waves. A helpless plaything was the king of Thessaly. Long ere the dim evening light had made of the shore of his own land a faint, grey line, the white-maned horses of Poseidon, king of the seas, began to rear their heads, and as night fell, a black curtain, blotting out every landmark, and all home-like things, the East Wind rushed across the Ægean Sea, smiting the sea-horses into madness, seizing the sails with cruel grasp and casting them in tatters before it, snapping the mast as though it were but a dry reed by the river. Before so mighty a tempest no oars could be of any avail, and for a little time only the winds and waves gambolled like a half-sated wolf-pack over their helpless prey. With hungry roar the great weight of black water stove in the deck and swept the sailors out of the ship to choke them in its icy depths; and ever it would lift the wounded thing high up on its foaming white crests, as though to toss it to the dark sky, and ever again would suck it down into the blackness, while the shrieking winds drove it onward with howling taunts and mocking laughter. While life stayed in him, Ceyx thought only of Halcyone. He had no fear, only the fear of the grief his death must bring to her who loved him as he loved her, his peerless queen, his Halcyone. His prayers to the gods were prayers for her. For himself he asked one thing only--that the waves might bear his body to her sight, so that her gentle hands might lay him in his tomb. With shout of triumph that they had slain a king, winds and waves seized him even as he prayed, and the Day Star that was hidden behind the black pall of the sky knew that his son, a brave king and a faithful lover, had gone down to the Shades. When Dawn, the rosy-fingered, had come to Thessaly, Halcyone, white-faced and tired-eyed, anxiously watched the sea, that still was tossing in half-savage mood. Eagerly she gazed at the place where last the white sail had been seen. Was it not possible that Ceyx, having weathered the gale, might for the present have foregone his voyage to Ionia, and was returning to her to bring peace to her heart? But the sea-beach was strewn with wrack and the winds still blew bits of tattered surf along the shore, and for her there was only the heavy labour of waiting, of waiting and of watching for the ship that never came. The incense from her altars blew out, in heavy sweetness, to meet the bitter-sweet tang of the seaweed that was carried in by the tide, for Halcyone prayed on, fearful, yet hoping that her prayers might still keep safe her man--her king--her lover. She busied herself in laying out the garments he would wear on his return, and in choosing the clothes in which she might be fairest in his eyes. This robe, as blue as the sky in spring--silver-bordered, as the sea in kind mood is bordered with a feathery silver fringe. She could recall just how Ceyx looked when first he saw her wear it. She could hear his very tones as he told her that of all queens she was the peeress, of all women the most beautiful, of all wives the most dear. Almost she forgot the horrors of the night, so certain did it seem that his dear voice must soon again tell her the words that have been love's litany since ever time began. In the ears of Juno those petitions for him whose dead body was even then being tossed hither and thither by the restless waves, his murderers, came at last to be more than even she could bear. She gave command to her handmaiden Iris to go to the palace of Somnus, god of Sleep and brother of Death, and to bid him send to Halcyone a vision, in the form of Ceyx, to tell her that all her weary waiting was in vain. In a valley among the black Cimmerian mountains the death-god Somnus had his abode. In her rainbow-hued robes, Iris darted through the sky at her mistress's bidding, tingeing, as she sped through them, the clouds that she passed. It was a silent valley that she reached at last. Here the sun never came, nor was there ever any sound to break the silence. From the ground the noiseless grey clouds, whose work it is to hide the sun and moon, rose softly and rolled away up to the mountain tops and down to the lowest valleys, to work the will of the gods. All around the cave lurked the long dark shadows that bring fear to the heart of children, and that, at nightfall, hasten the steps of the timid wayfarer. No noise was there, but from far down the valley there came a murmur so faint and so infinitely soothing that it was less a sound than of a lullaby remembered in dreams. For past the valley of Sleep flow the waters of Lethe, the river of Forgetfulness. Close up to the door of the cave where dwelt the twin brothers, Sleep and Death, blood-red poppies grew, and at the door itself stood shadowy forms, their fingers on their lips, enjoining silence on all those who would enter in, amaranth-crowned, and softly waving sheaves of poppies that bring dreams from which there is no awakening. There was there no gate with hinges to creak or bars to clang, and into the stilly darkness Iris walked unhindered. From outer cave to inner cave she went, and each cave she left behind was less dark than the one that she entered. In the innermost room of all, on an ebony couch draped with sable curtains, the god of sleep lay drowsing. His garments were black, strewn with golden stars. A wreath of half-opened poppies crowned his sleepy head, and he leaned on the strong shoulder of Morpheus, his favourite son. All round his bed hovered pleasant dreams, gently stooping over him to whisper their messages, like a field of wheat swayed by the breeze, or willows that bow their silver heads and murmur to each other the secrets that no one ever knows. Brushing the idle dreams aside, as a ray of sunshine brushes away the grey wisps of mist that hang to the hillside, Iris walked up to the couch where Somnus lay. The light from her rainbow-hued robe lit up the darkness of the cave, yet Somnus lazily only half-opened his eyes, moved his head so that it rested more easily, and in a sleepy voice asked of her what might be her errand. "Somnus," she said, "gentlest of gods, tranquilliser of minds and soother of careworn hearts, Juno sends you her commands that you despatch a dream to Halcyone in the city of Trachine, representing her lost husband and all the events of the wreck." Her message delivered, Iris hastened away, for it seemed to her that already her eyelids grew heavy, and that there were creeping upon her limbs, throwing silver dust in her eyes, lulling into peaceful slumber her mind, those sprites born of the blood-red poppies that bring to weary mortals rest and sweet forgetfulness. Only rousing himself sufficiently to give his orders, Somnus entrusted to Morpheus the task imposed upon him by Juno, and then, with a yawn, turned over on his downy pillow, and gave himself up to exquisite slumber. When he had winged his way to Trachine, Morpheus took upon himself the form of Ceyx and sought the room where Halcyone slept. She had watched the far horizon many hours that day. For many an hour had she vainly burned incense to the gods. Tired in heart and soul, in body and in mind, she laid herself down on her couch at last, hoping for the gift of sleep. Not long had she slept, in the dead-still sleep that weariness and a stricken heart bring with them, when Morpheus came and stood by her side. He was only a dream, yet his face was the face of Ceyx. Not the radiant, beautiful son of the Day Star was the Ceyx who stood by her now and gazed on her with piteous, pitying dead eyes. His clothing dripped sea-water; in his hair was tangled the weed of the sea, uprooted by the storm. Pale, pale was his face, and his white hands gripped the stones and sand that had failed him in his dying agony. Halcyone whimpered in her sleep as she looked on him, and Morpheus stooped over her and spoke the words that he had been told to say. "I am thy husband, Ceyx, Halcyone. No more do prayers and the blue-curling smoke of incense avail me. Dead am I, slain by the storm and the waves. On my dead, white face the skies look down and the restless sea tosses my chill body that still seeks thee, seeking a haven in thy dear arms, seeking rest on thy warm, loving heart." With a cry Halcyone started up, but Morpheus had fled, and there were no wet footprints nor drops of sea-water on the floor, marking, as she had hoped, the way that her lord had taken. Not again did Sleep visit her that night. A grey, cold morning dawned and found her on the seashore. As ever, her eyes sought the far horizon, but no white sail, a messenger of hope, was there to greet her. Yet surely she saw something--a black speck, like a ship driven on by the long oars of mariners who knew well the path to home through the watery ways. From far away in the grey it hasted towards her, and then there came to Halcyone the knowledge that no ship was this thing, but a lifeless body, swept onwards by the hurrying waves. Nearer and nearer it came, until at length she could recognise the form of this flotsam and jetsam of the sea. With heart that broke as she uttered the words, she stretched out her arms and cried aloud: "O Ceyx! my Beloved! is it thus that thou returnest to me?" To break the fierce assaults of sea and of storm there had been built out from the shore a mole, and on to this barrier leapt the distraught Halcyone. She ran along it, and when the dead, white body of the man she loved was still out of reach, she prayed her last prayer--a wordless prayer of anguish to the gods. "Only let me get near him," she breathed. "Grant only that I nestle close against his dear breast. Let me show him that, living or dead, I am his, and he mine forever." And to Halcyone a great miracle was then vouchsafed, for from out of her snowy shoulders grew snow-white pinions, and with them she skimmed over the waves until she reached the rigid body of Ceyx, drifting, a helpless burden for the conquering waves, in with the swift-flowing tide. As she flew, she uttered cries of love and of longing, but only strange raucous cries came from the throat that had once only made music. And when she reached the body of Ceyx and would fain have kissed his marble lips, Halcyone found that no longer were her own lips like the petals of a fair red rose warmed by the sun. For the gods had heard her prayer, and her horny beak seemed to the watchers on the shore to be fiercely tearing at the face of him who had been king of Thessaly. [Illustration: A GREY COLD MORNING FOUND HER ON THE SEASHORE] Yet the gods were not merciless--or, perhaps, the love of Halcyone was an all-conquering love. For as the soul of Halcyone had passed into the body of a white-winged sea-bird, so also passed the soul of her husband the king. And for evermore Halcyone and her mate, known as the Halcyon birds, defied the storm and tempest, and proudly breasted, side by side, the angriest waves of the raging seas. To them, too, did the gods grant a boon: that, for seven days before the shortest day of the year, and for seven days after it, there should reign over the sea a great calm in which Halcyone, in her floating nest, should hatch her young. And to those days of calm and sunshine, the name of the Halcyon Days was given. And still, as a storm approaches, the white-winged birds come flying inland with shrill cries of warning to the mariners whose ships they pass in their flight. "Ceyx!" they cry. "Remember Ceyx!" And hastily the fishermen fill their sails, and the smacks drive homeward to the haven where the blue smoke curls upwards from the chimneys of their homesteads, and where the red poppies are nodding sleepily amongst the yellow corn. * * * * * _Note._--The kingfisher is commonly known as the real "Halcyon" bird. Of it Socrates says: "The bird is not great, but it has received great honour from the gods because of its lovingness; for while it is making its nest, all the world has the happy days which it calls halcyonidæ, excelling all others in their calmness." ARISTÆUS THE BEE-KEEPER "... Every sound is sweet; Myriads of rivers hurrying thro' the lawn, The moan of doves in immemorial elms, And murmuring of innumerable bees." Tennyson. In the fragrance of the blossom of the limes the bees are gleaning a luscious harvest. Their busy humming sounds like the surf on a reef heard from very far away, and would almost lull to sleep those who lazily, drowsily spend the sunny summer afternoon in the shadow of the trees. That line of bee-hives by the sweet-pea hedge shows where they store their treasure that men may rob them of it, but out on the uplands where the heather is purple, the wild bees hum in and out of the honey-laden bells and carry home their spoils to their own free fastnesses, from which none can drive them unless there comes a foray against them from the brown men of the moors. How many of us who watch their ardent labours know the story of Aristæus--he who first brought the art of bee-keeping to perfection in his own dear land of Greece, and whose followers are those men in veils of blue and green, that motley throng who beat fire-irons and create a hideous clamour in order that the queen bee and her excited followers may be checked in their perilous voyagings and beguiled to swarm in the sanctuary of a hive. Aristæus was a shepherd, the son of Cyrene, a water nymph, and to him there had come one day, as he listened to the wild bees humming amongst the wild thyme, the great thought that he might conquer these busy workers and make their toil his gain. He knew that hollow trees or a hole in a rock were used as the storage houses of their treasure, and so the wily shepherd lad provided for them the homes he knew that they would covet, and near them placed all the food that they most desired. Soon Aristæus became noted as a tamer of bees, and even in Olympus they spoke of his honey as a thing that was food for the gods. All might have gone well with Aristæus had there not come for him the fateful day when he saw the beautiful Eurydice and to her lost his heart. She fled before the fiery protestations of his love, and trod upon the serpent whose bite brought her down to the Shades. The gods were angry with Aristæus, and as punishment they slew his bees. His hives stood empty and silent, and no more did "the murmuring of innumerable bees" drowse the ears of the herds who watched their flocks cropping the red clover and the asphodel of the meadows. Underneath the swift-flowing water of a deep river, the nymph who was the mother of Aristæus sat on her throne. Fishes darted round her white feet, and beside her sat her attendants, spinning the fine strong green cords that twine themselves round the throats of those who perish when their arms can no longer fight against the force of the rushing current. A nymph sang as she worked, an old, old song, that told one of the old, old tales of man's weakness and the power of the creatures of water, but above her song those who listened heard a man's voice, calling loudly and pitifully. The voice was that of Aristæus, calling aloud for his mother. Then his mother gave command, and the waters of the river rolled asunder and let Aristæus pass down far below to where the fountains of the great rivers lie. A mighty roar of many waters dinned in his ears as the rivers started on the race that was to bring them all at last to their restless haven, the Ocean. To Cyrene he came at length, and to her told his sorrowful tale: "To men who live their little lives and work and die as I myself--though son of a nymph and of a god--must do," he said, "I have brought two great gifts, oh my mother. I have taught them that from the grey olives they can reap a priceless harvest, and from me they have learned that the little brown bees that hum in and out of the flowers may be made slaves that bring to them the sweetest riches of which Nature may be robbed." "This do I already know, my son," said Cyrene, and smiled upon Aristæus. "Yet dost thou not know," said Aristæus, "the doom that has overtaken my army of busy workers. No longer does there come from my city of bees the boom of many wings and many busy little feet as they fly, swift and strong, hither and thither, to bring back to the hives their honeyed treasure. The comb is empty. The bees are all dead--or, if not dead, they have forsaken me forever." Then spoke Cyrene. "Hast heard, my son," she said, "of Proteus? It is he who herds the flocks of the boundless sea. On days when the South Wind and the North Wind wrestle together, and when the Wind from the East smites the West Wind in shame before him, thou mayst see him raise his snowy head and long white beard above the grey-green waves of the sea, and lash the white-maned, unbridled, fierce sea-horses into fury before him. Proteus only--none but Proteus--can tell thee by what art thou canst win thy bees back once more." Then Aristæus with eagerness questioned his mother how he might find Proteus and gain from him the knowledge that he sought, and Cyrene answered: "No matter how piteously thou dost entreat him, never, save by force, wilt thou gain his secret from Proteus. Only if thou canst chain him by guile as he sleeps and hold fast the chains, undaunted by the shapes into which he has the power to change himself, wilt thou win his knowledge from him." Then Cyrene sprinkled her son with the nectar of the deathless gods, and in his heart there was born a noble courage and through him a new life seemed to run. "Lead me now to Proteus, oh my mother!" he said, and Cyrene left her throne and led him to the cave where Proteus, herdsman of the seas, had his dwelling. Behind the seaweed-covered rocks Aristæus concealed himself, while the nymph used the fleecy clouds for her covering. And when Apollo drove his chariot across the high heavens at noon, and all land and all sea were hot as molten gold, Proteus with his flocks returned to the shade of his great cave by the sobbing sea, and on its sandy floor he stretched himself, and soon lay, his limbs all lax and restful, in the exquisite joy of a dreamless sleep. From behind the rocks Aristæus watched him, and when, at length, he saw that Proteus slept too soundly to wake gently he stepped forward, and on the sleep-drowsed limbs of Proteus fixed the fetters that made him his captive. Then, in joy and pride at having been the undoing of the shepherd of the seas, Aristæus shouted aloud. And Proteus, awaking, swiftly turned himself into a wild boar with white tusks that lusted to thrust themselves into the thighs of Aristæus. But Aristæus, unflinching, kept his firm hold of the chain. Next did he become a tiger, tawny and velvet black, and fierce to devour. And still Aristæus held the chain, and never let his eye fall before the glare of the beast that sought to devour him. A scaly dragon came next, breathing out flames, and yet Aristæus held him. Then came a lion, its yellow pelt scented with the lust of killing, and while Aristæus yet strove against him there came to terrify his listening ears the sound of fire that lapped up and thirstily devoured all things that would stand against it. And ere the crackle of the flames and their great sigh of fierce desire had ceased, there came in his ears the sound of many waters, the booming rush of an angry river in furious flood, the irresistible command of the almighty waves of the sea. Yet still Aristæus held the chains, and at last Proteus took his own shape again, and with a sigh like the sigh of winds and waves on the desolate places where ships become wrecks, and men perish and there is never a human soul to save or to pity them, he spoke to Aristæus. "Puny one!" he said, "and puny are thy wishes! Because thou didst by thy foolish wooing send the beautiful Eurydice swiftly down to the Shades and break the heart of Orpheus, whose music is the music of the Immortals, the bees that thou hast treasured have left their hives empty and silent. So little are the bees! so great, O Aristæus, the bliss or woe of Orpheus and Eurydice! Yet, because by guile thou hast won the power to gain from me the knowledge that thou dost seek, hearken to me now, Aristæus! Four bulls must thou find--four cows of equal beauty. Then must thou build in a leafy grove four altars, and to Orpheus and Eurydice pay such funeral honours as may allay their resentment. At the end of nine days, when thou hast fulfilled thy pious task, return and see what the gods have sent thee." "This will I do most faithfully, O Proteus," said Aristæus, and gravely loosened the chains and returned to where his mother awaited him, and thence travelled to his own sunny land of Greece. Most faithfully, as he had said, did Aristæus perform his vow. And when, on the ninth day, he returned to the grove of sacrifice, a sound greeted him which made his heart stop and then go on beating and throbbing as the heart of a man who has striven valiantly in a great fight and to whom the battle is assured. For, from the carcase of one of the animals offered for sacrifice, and whose clean white bones now gleamed in the rays of the sun that forced its way through the thick shade of the grove of grey olives, there came the "murmuring of innumerable bees." "Out of the eater came forth meat, out of the strong came forth sweetness." And Aristæus, a Samson of the old Greek days, rejoiced exceedingly, knowing that his thoughtless sin was pardoned, and that for evermore to him belonged the pride of giving to all men the power of taming bees, the glory of mastering the little brown creatures that pillage from the fragrant, bright-hued flowers their most precious treasure. PROSERPINE "Sacred Goddess, Mother Earth, Thou from whose immortal bosom, Gods, and men, and beasts have birth, Leaf and blade, and bud and blossom, Breathe thine influence most divine On thine own child, Proserpine. If with mists of evening dew Thou dost nourish those young flowers Till they grow, in scent and hue, Fairest children of the hours, Breathe thine influence most divine On thine own child, Proserpine." Shelley. The story of Persephone--of Proserpine--is a story of spring. When the sun is warming the bare brown earth, and the pale primroses look up through the snowy blackthorns at a kind, blue sky, almost can we hear the soft wind murmur a name as it gently sways the daffodils and breathes through the honey sweetness of the gold-powdered catkins on the grey willows by the river--"Persephone! Persephone!" Now once there was a time when there was no spring, neither summer nor autumn, nor chilly winter with its black frosts and cruel gales and brief, dark days. Always was there sunshine and warmth, ever were there flowers and corn and fruit, and nowhere did the flowers grow with more dazzling colours and more fragrant perfume than in the fair garden of Sicily. To Demeter, the Earth Mother, was born a daughter more fair than any flower that grew, and ever more dear to her became her child, the lovely Proserpine. By the blue sea, in the Sicilian meadows, Proserpine and the fair nymphs who were her companions spent their happy days. Too short were the days for all their joy, and Demeter made the earth yet fairer than it was that she might bring more gladness to her daughter Proserpine. Each day the blossoms that the nymphs twined into garlands grew more perfect in form and in hue, but from the anemones of royal purple and crimson, and the riotous red of geraniums, Proserpine turned one morning with a cry of gladness, for there stood before her beside a little stream, on one erect, slim stem, a wonderful narcissus, with a hundred blossoms. Her eager hand was stretched out to pluck it, when a sudden black cloud overshadowed the land, and the nymphs, with shrieks of fear, fled swiftly away. And as the cloud descended, there was heard a terrible sound, as of the rushing of many waters or the roll of the heavy wheels of the chariot of one who comes to slay. Then was the earth cleft open, and from it there arose the four coal-black horses of Pluto, neighing aloud in their eagerness, while the dark-browed god urged them on, standing erect in his car of gold. "'The coal-black horses rise--they rise, O mother, mother!' low she cries-- Persephone--Persephone! 'O light, light, light!' she cries, 'farewell; The coal-black horses wait for me. O shade of shades, where I must dwell, Demeter, mother, far from thee!'"[5] In cold, strong arms Pluto seized her--in that mighty grasp that will not be denied, and Proserpine wept childish tears as she shivered at his icy touch, and sobbed because she had dropped the flowers she had picked, and had never picked the flower she most desired. While still she saw the fair light of day, the little oddly-shaped rocky hills, the vineyards and to-day, my dear?’ “‘None at all,’ said Mr. Fox. ‘That marketing place is no good.’ “‘Why not?’ asked Mrs. Fox as she raised her head. “‘Because, my dear,’ said Mr. Fox, ‘there is a man around with a gun.’ “‘Oh dear,’ shivered Mrs. Fox. ‘Did you hear the gun?’ “‘Indeed I just escaped being killed.’ “‘Oh, my love,’ said Mrs. Fox. ‘Well, we still have some chicken left, and to-morrow you’ll just have to find a new market—that’s all!’” OCTOBER 1: Gypsy, the Cat “Gypsy was a cat,” said daddy, “who had been so named because she had been picked up one night when she was all alone, and when she certainly looked as if she had had no home for weeks and months. She certainly looked as if she had led a gypsy’s life—wandering and homeless, and she seemed happy indeed to be taken by little Marian to her nice warm house. “Marian got home just before dinner time. ‘Ah,’ she thought to herself, ‘Gypsy will have a nice dinner—not just a meal she has had to pick up as best she could. It will be a real meal, and she will have her milk in a fine saucer. “‘I have brought a cat home,’ said Marian to her mother. ‘I have named her Gypsy as she is a poor little waif cat, quite homeless and friendless.’ “Right away Gypsy was given a nice warm bowl of milk. And then Marian’s family sat down for their dinner. “Gypsy sat upon a bookcase. ‘Maybe she thinks she looks wise,’ said Marian. And Gypsy blinked her eyes and purred as if to say, ‘I am a wise cat. I know I have a good home. And I have the sense to look happy.’ “While Marian and her family were eating Gypsy would look at them from time to time, but every time any of them turned to look at her, she would put her head to one side and look off into space. She seemed to be saying, ‘Maybe I have been a waif but I’m very proud. And I will not appear to be a beggar.’ “So from that day on, Gypsy always had some milk before Marian began her dinner. She never begged for food, for she was a Gypsy cat with a great deal of pride!” OCTOBER 2: The Make-Believe Elephant “Lucy,” said daddy, “had her home in a big city apartment house.” “Down in the main hallway, on a stand there, was an elephant. Not a real elephant, for of course a real elephant could hardly find room on a hallway stand, to say the least. This one was made out of stone and he was exactly the same color as a real, live elephant. “Now often Lucy would come in from dancing class, or from play, or from school, and she would wonder what it would be like to be a stone elephant, and she used to feel very sorry for the elephant, always standing in the hall. “‘I know,’ she would say, ‘that the elephant isn’t a real, live one, but just the same, it does seem funny to be always in the same place, day after day.’ “And then one evening when Lucy was asleep the Dream King sent the elephant to call on her. “‘I know,’ the elephant began, without even waiting for Lucy to make a curtsy as she might have done if he had only given her time, ‘that you have often wondered about me.’ “‘I have,’ said Lucy, ‘it is true.’ “‘But,’ said the elephant, ‘you mustn’t, for I am very happy. The reason I am happy is because I haven’t the brains or the feelings to be unhappy because I am always in one place. “‘If I were a real elephant I would want to go out in the sunshine, I would want to eat, I would even want to play baseball; perhaps I would march in parades. But I’m not a real elephant—I’m only a make-believe one, and I haven’t any feeling at all—no, not a scrap of feeling. “‘And I haven’t any brains. I couldn’t even smile at you if you were awake. It’s the old Dream King who is helping me to smile now.’ “And Lucy noticed that the elephant was smiling, such a funny, droll, stone-elephant smile. “‘No, Lucy,’ the elephant continued, ‘you need never feel sorry for me because I am always in one place. I am like a table or a chair or a bed—except I am made in the shape of an animal. “‘It is nice to be a stone elephant if one has always been one,’ it said, ‘and I suppose it is nice to be a little girl if one has always been one,’ and it waved its trunk and was gone.” OCTOBER 3: Canary Cloudy Wings “Cloudy Wings thought he would like to see the world,” said daddy. “He had always had a good deal of freedom but he thought he would like more. “So this little canary flew out of a window. He wandered about and flew from bush to bush. Soon it began to rain. “Cloudy Wings stood under the tree but the rain dripped down over his little body and his bright yellow feathers were all wet. “‘Oh, how cold it is,’ thought Cloudy Wings to himself. ‘I can’t shake off this water as I do my bath water, because it all comes on me again. And my little Master always puts me in the sun to dry after my bath. If there is no sun I am put near a stove or where I can slowly get good and dry. This is awful!’ And he gave miserable little sounds. “Of course in the meantime, McLean, his Master, was almost frightened out of his poor wits. What could have happened to Cloudy Wings? He saw that a window had been left open, and he knew the bird must have gone out. He kept the window open hoping Cloudy Wings would come back, and he sat by the open window, shivering in the dampness, saying to himself, and trying hard to keep back the tears: “‘Oh Cloudy Wings, come back! I want you so! Please come back, Cloudy Wings!’ “Poor Cloudy Wings, wet and miserable, saw a round glass house, and beat his wings against the panes of glass. “An old man was inside looking after his flowers, for the glass house was a conservatory of flowers and plants. When he saw the poor little wet bird he opened the door and took him in. Cloudy Wings sat in his warm hands while the old man smoothed and dried the little wet feathers. “‘You belong to the little boy down the road,’ he said to himself. ‘I’ve seen you in the window. I always could tell you by your gray wings.’ So back in the old man’s pocket Cloudy Wings went to his Master, and never again did he leave his home.” OCTOBER 4: The Abused Pencil “A boy named Gerald,” said daddy, “was finding it very hard to do his lessons. School had commenced and yet the days were so lovely it was hard to study. “He could not draw a map and he was supposed to have one drawn for the next day. He found it so hard to remember just how the places looked on the map and he was supposed to do it from memory. “He gave up trying the map after a few moments. Then he sat and chewed the end of his pencil. Perhaps in a moment or two he would think of all the places he was supposed to mark. “He decided he would do his arithmetic but he could not manage the sums. They were all so extremely hard. Much worse than they had been in the spring, though in reality they were a little easier. The teacher had known the children had had a long summer and it would take them a little time to get back into their work. “He tried to do the sums but couldn’t. What a pity the book had no answers in the back! And he began to chew the end of his pencil again while he tried to think. “Before long he felt he could not do his lessons for he was too tired and they were entirely too hard. He was dreadfully afraid he would be put back with the boys a year younger than he was, and yet he couldn’t do such difficult lessons. “How ashamed he would be to be put back! Oh dear, what could he do? He must simply tell the teacher the lessons were too hard. But then he felt sure she would tell him to go back into a class where they were easier. “He put his head down on his arms. The soft autumn breeze was blowing. It had been a warm day and two bumble-bees were buzzing and talking very near him. They were having some sort of a talk about the sweetness of the honey in the honeysuckle vine. “Just then he saw his pencil. The end of it was wrapped up in cotton wool and gauze. “‘Gracious, pencil, what is the matter?’ asked Gerald. “‘I shouldn’t think you would ask me what is the matter,’ said the pencil as it squeaked in a sad little voice. “‘Why not?’ asked Gerald. But the moment he had asked the question he knew the answer. “The pencil answered him just the same. ‘You know I am to do your work. I will work but I must be guided and directed. I cannot think. A pencil is not supposed to think. A boy is supposed to do that. I merely write down what you think is correct, and goodness only knows I often feel very badly when I have to write down all sorts of wrong answers. “‘And when I won’t think for you,’ continued the pencil, ‘this is the way you abuse me. Think! Don’t bite me to pieces. And I’ll tell you another thing. You may bite me in two, but never, never will I do your thinking for you. I am not supposed to and I won’t.’ The pencil was certainly very emphatic, Gerald thought, and he decided he would not argue with it. “‘I was a lovely red pencil with black lead,’ the pencil continued, in an injured tone, ‘and now I am all bitten to pieces. One of my ends is almost useless, and I will break when the lead is used very much further. Oh, dear! And I was such a nice pencil!’ It sighed and seemed very mournful. “Just at that moment the cotton wool came off the pencil and Gerald saw that he had been sleeping. The pencil had been badly bitten, but Gerald, now wide awake, put his mind to his studying, and found the lessons were not so hard after all!” OCTOBER 5: The Onions “We are far more useful than you are,” said the seeds of the lettuce which were just peeping above the ground in a box, showing their little green heads. They were in a schoolroom. “I can’t help that,” said the geranium plant. “I was never meant to be useful. I try to be bright and cheerful. I wish I could be useful but every one can’t be just the same as every one else. Neither can plants all be the same. Vegetables can’t be plants and plants can’t be vegetables. But we all have our own reasons for being here.” “I don’t see,” said one of the onions. They were very small but were also coming up in a box of their own. And after the onion had said that, it kept quite still just as if it had completely finished talking. “You commenced to say something,” said the lettuce. “Why not finish?” “Sometimes I get too discouraged to finish,” said the onion. “We all feel that way at times.” “And why?” asked the lettuce. “For you it is different, little lettuce leaves,” said the onion. “You are a salad when you grow up. You are considered a luxury and a treat.” “Don’t people enjoy eating you?” asked the lettuce. “Yes,” said the onion, “they often enjoy eating us. But they won’t give us any praise for it. They eat us when they’re off by themselves as if they were a little ashamed of eating us. “I have often heard folks say,” continued the onion, “‘Oh, I am ashamed to admit it, but I do like fried onions.’ Then another will say, ‘Just imagine, little Freddy likes to eat raw onions when they are small.’ Oh, things like that cut us so,” said the onion. “We like to be eaten. All vegetables do, but we would like to be appreciated.” “If you weren’t appreciated and liked,” said the lettuce politely, “you wouldn’t be planted and grown. They use you all the time—to season food and to make things have a nice taste.” “Ah,” said the onion, which was doing all the talking for the family, “that is true. But listen to what they always say. They explain that they like to put a little onion in the soup—not so the soup will taste of onion—oh, mercy, no—but just to give it a little flavor. That is what we do. We flavor many a dish, but we don’t get the credit. Life is full of trials,” ended the onion. OCTOBER 6: Trixie’s Burglar “It was night time and Trixie the parrot,” said daddy, “had her head under her wing. Sometimes she slept this way, just as a canary bird would sleep. But often she would huddle up on her perch and doze off with her head drooping down a little on her chest. “All of the family were asleep when Trixie seemed to hear in her dream a strange sound. She pulled her head from under her wing and looked about her with sleepy eyes. “Did she see some one way off in the corner? Trixie was frightened. She did not quite know why. She was never frightened of people, but this person stayed where it was so dark, and did not light a light—only a little one that flashed quickly and went right out again. “When her master came downstairs late at night, he always turned on the light. But Trixie thought she had better be polite. This was probably some very queer guest and she must be nice, for all the family were asleep. “‘Hello,’ said Trixie. The man grumbled to himself. ‘He didn’t answer me,’ thought Trixie. ‘I must speak again.’ And this time she shrieked, ‘Hello.’ “‘Will you keep quiet?’ said the man in a frightened, low voice. “‘No,’ answered Trixie, ‘never still.’ Now Trixie had said this in a very loud voice, and from upstairs Trixie’s master heard the parrot. ‘She never says that except when some one is here,’ he said, and he went downstairs. “As he reached the room where the parrot was he saw a man hurrying off—hurrying off before he had had a chance to get anything, for he had spent his time since Trixie had spoken putting a large coat over the parrot’s cage. “The window had been left open and a burglar had come in, but Trixie, the parrot, had been the cause of his going out.” OCTOBER 7: An Autumn Party “A trumpet sounded through the woods,” said daddy, “and then the voice of Mr. Giant was heard saying, ‘Come, all the fairies, to the bonfire party. Come, brownies; come, elves; come, gnomes; come, bogeys; come, goblins; and come, Witty Witch!’ “At that all the creatures came flying and running and rushing to the bonfire party. The invitations were delivered by Mr. Wind to those who were any distance away. They told stories, they sang, and they ate roasted corn. And later on, when Mr. Moon had come up to see what was going on, they danced. And how like fairyland they all did look, for they all wore gorgeous costumes of the early autumn colors.” OCTOBER 8: A Little Dog “A little black dog named Soot,” said daddy, “was out for a scamper when he saw out in the lake, far out from the shore, an upturned canoe and two girls trying to swim with all their clothes on to the shore. They could swim—yes, but how long could they keep it up? “Oh, dear, how badly Soot did feel to be so small. He could not rescue them. He was so very tiny. But he had a voice and he could run on his little legs. So back into the village he tore as fast as he could, barking, barking, barking. “He ran to some men and he stood around them barking and jumping up and down; his little face looking very sad and worried. “‘Something must be wrong,’ said one of the men. ‘Let’s go and see. This dog never acts like this as a rule.’ Soot led them down by the water and there they saw the upturned boat and the two girls trying so hard to swim to shore. The men rushed to one of the boat houses on the shore of the lake. Everything had been closed up, for the boating season was almost over and very few people went out in the autumn. The men broke open a boat house and they took a launch out into the lake. They just reached the two girls in time. In another three minutes they could not have kept up any longer. They had called for help but the wind had carried their voices in another direction, and the only one who had seen them was Soot, their real rescuer!” OCTOBER 9: Alta’s Guinea Pigs “Now, there were two guinea pigs which were quite big. They were the mother and daddy guinea pigs. And there were three smaller guinea pigs. They were the children, of course,” explained daddy, “and they all belonged to a pretty little girl named Alta. “It was night-time, and Alta was sound asleep. And as it was winter-time, the guinea pigs were in the box in Alta’s room. “The guinea pigs were all asleep, too, when they heard a scratching on their box. First Daddy Guinea Pig opened his eyes. “‘What is it you want?’ he asked. “‘Don’t be afraid,’ said a low voice. ‘I’m Peter Gnome. I’ve come to call on you. I won’t hurt you. I think you are all very nice. And your children, sir, are lovely.’ “That pleased Daddy Guinea Pig so much that he invited Peter Gnome to look at the children and to play with them. Mother Guinea Pig was awake now, and as Peter Gnome gently took the little guinea pigs in his hands, one by one, they squealed sleepily and seemed no more than little round bits of fuzz. “First Peter Gnome would stroke one guinea pig and then another, and he told the daddy and mother that he simply could not make up his mind which was the loveliest. “That delighted the proud parents, for they had never been able to decide themselves. “‘Did you feel like eating the children when they were very young, Mr. Guinea Pig?’ asked Peter Gnome. “‘Feel like eating my own children?’ he squealed in such a loud voice that Peter was very much afraid Alta would awaken. “‘Well, there are many creatures who do,’ said Peter Gnome. ‘I only asked because I wanted to know and I heard you did.’ “‘Well, now you know,’ said Daddy Guinea Pig, ‘that I do not eat my children when they are young or old. I most certainly do not. I love them from the first day up, and more all the time.’ “‘He does, indeed,’ said Mother Guinea Pig. ‘He is a great help to me. He is an unusual Guinea Pig.’ “‘He is devoted to us,’ squealed the little guinea pigs. “‘I’m so glad to hear it,’ said Peter Gnome. ‘You’ll forgive the question?’ “‘To be sure,’ said Daddy Guinea Pig, who was calm again now. ‘Of course there are guinea pigs and other creatures who do such things, but I’m not one of them. Never, never, never!’ “‘I’m honored to have met you, sir,’ said Peter Gnome, ‘and your family is wonderful.’ So off he hurried, throwing behind him a piece of cabbage leaf and saying to himself what a lovely family of guinea pigs they were.” OCTOBER 10: A Devoted Dog “Bobbie was a small fox terrier. He was black and white,” said daddy. “Or perhaps I had better say he had a white body with black spots. “He belonged to a little girl named Lily and he was very, very fond of her. “One day Lily’s mother said: ‘How would you like to visit your cousins?’ Lily thought it would be splendid. On the following day the trunk was brought down from the attic to be packed. Bobbie saw it and knew that he was not going to be taken on the trip. If he had been going too, Lily would have acted very differently. “He sat by the trunk and cried! And all day long he wouldn’t move. Early the next morning the trunk was carried away to the depot by an expressman, and poor Bobbie howled. “Lily kissed his little black-spotted ears and she, too, cried but her cousins did not want Bobbie brought too. “After Lily had left the house Bobbie would not be comforted. He would not eat, and all day long he would look up the road to see if Lily was coming. The next night there was a sudden scamper and a wild bound. For far away Bobbie had heard the sounds of wheels and he felt Lily was there. Yes, she had come right home. She had missed her Bobbie. And never again were they apart.” OCTOBER 11: A Bird’s Secret “The Fairy Wondrous Secrets told me to talk to you when you were asleep,” said the canary to his little mistress Cora. “Then tell me how it is you can get along without teeth,” said Cora. “My beak takes the place of teeth,” the canary explained. “It is very sharp, and I can eat all I want. “When you see me at the cuttlefish and the sugar, I am really sharpening my beak—just as though it were a knife. Now that is something creatures cannot do with teeth. Whoever heard of people sharpening their teeth? “But that is what we do all the time with our beaks—we birds. Yes, we also sharpen our beaks on the bars in our cages. And the birds outside find plenty of tools for sharpening. We are never bothered about eating anything we wish to have. If we feel like it we sharpen up in time and then how we do enjoy our food.” OCTOBER 12: Columbus Day October twelfth is not celebrated as a holiday because it was the day when Christopher Columbus was born, but because it was supposed to be the date upon which Columbus first stood upon the ground which forms a part of the continent of America. The exact date of his birth is not known nor the exact place. Columbus took many voyages in his life-time; he discovered many islands and made for himself a great and lasting name in history, but he never knew he had discovered a new continent! Always he thought that those places he had touched were parts of Asia. And it seems quite sad to think of the times we’ve been applauded (and often, very justly too!) when we’ve recited well or played the piano well, while Christopher Columbus, who discovered America, did not even know of the great deed that he had done. Never had he any realization that in a new continent they would erect monuments to him, nor that in schools they would give pageants about his trip, his discouragements, his successes. And his little son Diego, whom Queen Isabella made a page at the Spanish Court, could not boast to the others and say, “My father has discovered a new continent, which is more than can be said for most fathers, and most people for that matter!” For neither did little Diego know; and it has always seemed such a pity. It would have been so splendid a thing for any little boy to have been able to say! OCTOBER 13: The Camels “It always strikes folks as funny,” said Sophia Camel, “that we look our best in the winter time and not in the summer time when the zoo is filled with people and when so many come to ride us. “But we don’t care about our looks. We have our family ways. And one of our family ways is to molt our hair after the long winter is over. “We can’t change our ways to suit people, even if we would like to change them.” “We can’t, indeed,” said Sally Camel. “And though they may think it a pity we don’t dress up in the summer time they will have to take us as they find us and be satisfied.” OCTOBER 14: A Naughty Cat “Jota, the cat,” said daddy, “was always complaining. First Jota would leave her milk as if she didn’t like it at all and then she would upset her little dish filled with bacon. “There was really nothing in the world the matter with Jota except that she had been spoiled. “‘I have some nice milk for you to-day,’ said the cook. ‘It has just come and it is good and warm.’ “Now Jota was thinking of the mice she had heard scampering in the cellar. She didn’t want the milk. She would much rather have mice. And when cook lifted her up and carried her to the corner of the kitchen where she had put the bowl of milk, Jota scratched as well as snarled. “Oh, how badly the cook did feel! Not because the scratch was such a bad one. No, that amounted to very little, but she felt so hurt that Jota could have scratched her. She had always been so good to Jota. “Jota hurried to the cellar. Yes, now she smelt the mice! Ah, what a scamper she would have. She did not want milk. No, she would have mice. She sprang for a mouse. What! It had vanished. Then she tried for another as it was hurrying across the floor. She missed the second one. She tried to catch three others and each time she missed them. “Jota for once in her life was thoroughly and absolutely ashamed of herself. She had not been able to catch the mice and she had once been famous for her powers as a mouse catcher. “Yes, she had grown lazy and useless. She had been stupid too. That was all because she had not been unselfish and nice, but had been horrid to every one. And it had spoiled her. She could not catch mice! “Jota was a very sad cat as she slowly climbed the cellar stairs. She went back into the kitchen and there she drank the milk she had been so rude and horrid about before. “‘Oh, you were thirsty after all,’ said the kind cook. Jota purred and jumped into the cook’s lap, trying to say: “‘I know I have been horrid but please forgive me now.’” OCTOBER 15: The Chipmunks “The chipmunks were having a fine time the other day,” said daddy. ‘Hurry up, hurry up,’ said old Father Chipmunk to the younger ones. ‘We want all the nuts we can get for the winter. There will be a long, long, time to eat, and we must hunt now.’ “Mother Chipmunk was down in her hole in the ground. The squirrels always have their homes in the holes of trees but the chipmunks like the ground better. She was teaching all the very little ones that they must only drink dew-drops. For they are like the rabbit family, and think that water which has touched the ground is very dangerous to drink. They will only drink fresh dew-drops and rain water from leaves and flowers. “All the little chipmunks hurried and scurried about, and pretty soon Father Chipmunk said, ‘I will offer a prize for the one who gets the greatest number of nuts. Hurry, scurry!’ “Chippy Chappy won the prize. ‘It is a house I made out of nuts—a nice little house of special kinds of nuts,’ said Father Chipmunk, ‘and Chippy Chappy can eat a room whenever he feels hungry! But now, all of you hurry, and hide your nuts!’ And off they scampered to their little homes with their winter food.” OCTOBER 16: The Fairies’ Trip “The queen of the fairies said,” began daddy, “‘I have a scheme. We will visit the clouds.’ “At that the loveliest airships appeared. They looked almost like clouds themselves, so filmy and white were they. “So off they sailed, feeling just like birds with the delightful flying motion of the ships. And up to the silvery clouds they went. When they got in the clouds the cloud fairies—you know there are fairies who live in the clouds all the time—took them all around and showed them their homes. And such homes as they have! They have the most marvelous palaces, with courtyards and exquisite scenery all about. They have tall mountains where they always go for their parties. Everything is such a beautiful color too, for the cloud fairies are very fond of pale grays and blues and silver. “Then the fairies from the woods suggested to the cloud fairies that they should return their visit and come to earth. “‘We would love to do that,’ said the cloud fairies. So off they began to fly from the clouds. They needed no airships but do you know what happened? “As they began to drop great big drops of rain fell to the earth, and then the heaviest kind of a rainstorm began for the earth people, for of course when the cloud fairies move the rain is not held any more and it falls to the earth. “But the fairies from the woods didn’t mind, as the big trees always protect them, and the cloud fairies only let the rain fall where there were no trees. So the afternoon was one of greatest pleasure for both the wood fairies and the cloud fairies.” OCTOBER 17: The Lion Babies “I have a true circus story to tell you this evening,” said daddy. “It’s to be a strange story, because it is to be about a mother dog who looked after some lion babies.” “A mother dog who looked after lions?” shouted the children. “Yes,” said daddy, “and you remember I said it was true. “One time in the circus a mother Lioness grew very, very sick. “‘I am afraid she will not live,’ said the Keeper. “‘But whatever will happen to her dear little Lion Babies?’ asked another man. “‘I’m sure I don’t know,’ said the Keeper. ‘We will just have to do the best we can. I have watched her with them a good deal and perhaps I can look after them.’ “‘She is so fond of them,’ said the other man. ‘What a pity it is she can’t live.’ “The Lioness seemed to know she could not live. Over and over again she kissed her little Lion Babies with her tongue. And when she opened her mouth, her great, cruel teeth could be seen—but the little babies didn’t know their mother had teeth—so gentle was she with them. “And the Lion Babies nestled close to their mother, and by the little, soft growls they made, they were trying to say, ‘How we love you, mother! Your fur is so warm, so soft. You are so good to us, mother. How we love you!’ [Illustration: “SO OFF THEY SAILED, FEELING JUST LIKE BIRDS WITH THE DELIGHTFUL FLYING MOTION OF THE SHIPS”—_Page 243_] “And then the Lioness held them closer. And with one of her paws which could have crushed and killed a creature if she had so wished, she fondled and petted her babies. “Slowly as she talked to them in her low, growling way, she began to see ahead. Her eyes gazed far out of the bars of her cage. “‘What will happen to my babies when I am not here to look after them?’ she was thinking. Her eyes stared and stared into space—beyond the people who passed by every little while to watch the beautiful mother Lioness and the little Lions. “And she began to think so hard that she almost forgot her babies. She was searching with her eyes way, way out into an unknown world, and wondering, wondering all the time what would happen to her lovely brood. “The Lion babies nestled closer. Mother was letting the cold in! And again she fondled them, while from her eyes that so often looked treacherous and wicked, great tears fell down on their soft, warm fur. “The next morning when the Lion Babies woke up there was no mother Lioness. They couldn’t imagine what had happened. They saw the big man always around their cage, feeding them, talking to them in soft, kind tones, but their lovely warm, soft, furry mother, where was she? “The day went on and still she didn’t come! Oh, such miserable little Lion Babies as they were! The Keeper did all he could for them—but he couldn’t feed them anything to take away that queer feeling they had. For it wasn’t hunger—it was loneliness! And the Lion Babies found that no food filled that place! “But the next morning when the Keeper came to look at the Lion Babies, there outside the cage was the big, woolly sheep dog. She was licking the paws of the Lion Babies and they were once again giving their low growls. “When the dog saw the Keeper she jumped up and down as if to say, ‘Let me care for the Lion Babies.’ “The Keeper saw that the Lion Babies were quite gentle with the dog, and he seemed to know that they wanted to be together—so he let the dog in the cage. “Day after day the dog stayed with the Lion Babies, except when she came out now and again for a run. And the dog brought up the little lions—and when they were big enough for the circus they always had the dog with them.” OCTOBER 18: Max’s Escape “A little dog,” said daddy, “was one of five beautiful puppies living in the country with a very proud and happy mother. “But, sad to tell, it was not very long before the mother dog heard her master saying to a friend of his, ‘I simply cannot keep so many dogs. There is no room for them—not even here in the country. You see I have as many animals now as I can possibly manage.’ “‘Well,’ said the friend, ‘I will take a puppy for you. I can keep one easily in our city house. There is plenty of room. I will take the little white one with the brown right ear.’ “So the little dog named Max was taken to the city. He was dreadfully homesick and one day when he was being taken for a walk led by a leash he escaped. “Such adventures as he had. He remembered the trip he had taken with his new master. First they had gone on a ferry boat across some water—and then on a train. So Max ran and ran until he reached the railroad station. He got through the gate when the guard wasn’t looking and he jumped up into the baggage car just as the train was pulling out. “On and on he rode until he saw some water and a great boat—just like the one he had been on before. What should he do? Jump? The train was going fast, but it stopped where the ferry boats were. And so Max reached home and his mother—and somehow or other room was made for him by his first master.” OCTOBER 19: The Fire Bell “In a big city school,” said daddy, “there were several thousand children. Pretty soon the school bell rang and all the children went to their different classrooms. “They had not been there long when a great bell sounded through the school. It was different from the usual school bell which brought them to their lessons, and it filled them all with fear. The teachers looked frightened too, but they were all very quiet. “‘March out, slowly, in single file,’ said the teacher of each classroom. ‘There! A little faster, but no shoving. We must all see how calm we can be. It is only when we become frightened that there is danger.’ And in this way every one tried to be calm, even though every one felt so nervous. “For the bell had been a fire bell. And they had all known it. Soon every single one of the children was out in the big courtyard and they had at last reached the street. The teachers were all out too, for they had all ‘kept their heads’ as the saying is.” OCTOBER 20: The Rain “We heard some people talking and they made us very angry,” said the Rain Drops. “They said, ‘Oh, it’s raining cats and dogs.’ And we would never rain cats and dogs, never, never, never, at any time at all.” The King of the Clouds laughed hard. “Well do I remember when it used to make me mad when people said those things,” he chuckled. “People often talk in that foolish way.” “Whatever do they mean by it?” asked the Rain Drops. “Nothing, nothing at all.” “Then they don’t imagine we will really rain cats and dogs?” asked the Rain Drops. “They know you really won’t,” said the King of the Clouds. “When they say that you are raining cats and dogs they mean that you are raining very hard and furiously.” “But, Cloud King,” said the Rain Drops, “there were some other people and they said that it was raining pitchforks. Now can you imagine us doing that? We wouldn’t rain pitchforks for anything. They’d hurt people and children and animals, and while we do love to splash and have our jokes, still we would never do anything mean such as rain pitchforks.” “Of course you wouldn’t,” said the King of the Clouds. “They say that in just the same way as they say it is ‘raining cats and dogs.’ That also simply means it’s raining very, very hard. So go back and play.” And the Rain Drops were much relieved. OCTOBER 21: Grandfather Pine Tree Two little pine trees had been planted by two big ones. They were so tiny, and the two big ones known as Grandfather and Grandmother Pine Tree were very, very tall, even for pine trees. “We seem so tiny,” said the little pine trees. “Will we ever grow to be as tall as you are?” And they tried to lift up their heads and see the tops of the big pines, but it was almost impossible. “Listen,” whispered Grandfather Pine Tree. “You will surely grow to be tall, so do not get discouraged. And more than that, you will be happy. You will be awake all the time. You will see what I have seen each year. “There will be snow soon and then there will be the springtime, when the flowers will peep above the ground and will say a good morning to all the world, and the leaves will follow the blossoms on the trees. “Then will follow the warm summer and the children from the white house down yonder will bring old rugs and books, and will come up under us. They know we’ll keep them cool. “You must grow to be strong and tall and you’ll find that it’s one of the most interesting of things in the world to be a pine tree. And most especially, to be a pine tree here on this hill overlooking the garden and the white house where two children, a little boy and a little girl, are always happy—all the year around, just as we are, in the winter, spring, summer and autumn.” And the two small pine trees decided they would try their hardest to grow and see as many lovely things as their grandfather and grandmother saw each year. OCTOBER 22: Jack Frost’s Evening “Jack Frost, and the Frost Brothers,” said daddy, “were off for a good time. ‘We’ll have the most wonderful party,’ said Jack Frost. “‘What will we do?’ asked the Frost Brothers. They were always ready to do anything Jack suggested, but they never thought of the things to do first. “‘We’ll celebrate,’ said Jack Frost. “‘What will we celebrate for?’ “‘Because the wind has gone to sleep and we can do our work in peace. Oh, such work as we’ll do!’ “‘First you say we’ll have a celebration, and then you say we’ll work. Whatever do you mean, Jack Frost?’ “‘I mean,’ he said cheerily, ‘that we’ll have both a celebration and that we’ll do wonderful work too. For work and play are all the same to me. I feel like singing a song about it.’ And off he started singing, dancing around as he sang these words: I’m so happy, I’m so gay, I like to work, I like to play. Whichever it is I do not mind, So long as the wind is still and kind. “They put many of the flowers to sleep for the winter. Then the Frost Brothers helped Jack Frost make his wonderful pictures and this was what they called the celebration. They worked all night, and when morning came, people looked out and saw their windows covered with frost. ‘Jack Frost must have been around last night,’ they said.” OCTOBER 23: Beans and Peas A can of beans and a can of peas were talking. They had just been opened and had been poured into large bowls in the kitchen. “Last summer,” said the peas, “a young man came from the city. He wanted to work in the garden, he said. “Well, of all the funny workers he was the funniest! But the funniest of all—that is—it was the funniest to us, was that he didn’t know us at all.” “He didn’t know you,” exclaimed the beans. “No,” grinned the peas, in their vegetable way, “he didn’t know whether we were flowers or vegetables. He looked at us from a little distance away and he said: “‘Are these flowers or vegetables?’” “Think of that,” exclaimed the beans. “Yes, he didn’t know peas,” said the peas. “Well,” said the beans, “we’ve heard of creatures who didn’t know beans, but we’ve never heard of creatures who didn’t know peas.” OCTOBER 24: Tiger West’s Food “Tiger West,” said daddy, “had been off on a number of trips with his cat friends who lived down the street. “Now Tiger West lived in great grandeur. He had a special bed of cushions and a blanket to curl under. He had a rug of white, soft, fluffy material which he could lie upon whenever he wanted. And he wore a beautiful bow to match his mistress’ gown. “His master was a very rich man, and Tiger West was used to the best of food. But he had missed adventures and when he became friendly with the cats down the street he certainly did have enough. He narrowly escaped having horrid cold water thrown on him from an upper window one time, because he had been getting some goodies out of an ash tin. ‘Meow,’ he said to himself, ‘what a joke it would be if the master could see me with my whiskers quite dirty and my beautiful fur ruffled up. Well, I know how to make myself look like a gentleman cat when I am ready to go home.’ “Days passed and Tiger West still went on trips with his cat friends. One day there was to be a meeting on the back fence of the cats of the neighborhood, and Tiger West was asked to be present. Now, Mr. Black Cat was very different looking from Tiger West. Mr. Black Cat’s fur was not handsome, and he had a thin look, not at all becoming to a cat. He looked as though he had to hunt for his food and had to exercise entirely too soon after eating. Tiger imagined he must have been chased away after every meal he took. “Still Mr. Black Cat was a leader in the cat neighborhood. He was President of the Night Singing Club, Vice-President of the Ash Can Visitors, Secretary of the Hunt Mice Club, and Treasurer of the Garbage Guild. He was always chosen as the judge of all the trials held in the cat neighborhood and for this reason he was always called ‘Your Honor.’ “Now it made Tiger West very much annoyed to hear such a common cat called by such a fine name. ‘Do you like strawberries and cream?’ he asked. “‘Never ate any,’ said Mr. Black Cat. “‘I do,’ said Tiger West, ‘and I eat them in and out of season. My master always gets them for me, or else he gets something else that is nice for my breakfast with cream.’ “‘It doesn’t satisfy my hunger to hear what you have had to eat,’ said Mr. Black Cat. “Still Tiger West wanted to show that he amounted to something and was better than Mr. Black Cat. ‘I never eat any kind of meat on a chicken but the tenderest white meat,’ he said. ‘And I am particularly fond of ice-cream. I like all the best food, and I get it too.’ “Mr. Black Cat raised his back and snarled. ‘This cat,’ he said, ‘tries to be superior to us. Let’s put him out of the club.’ “The cats were chasing Tiger West now, but he got away from them and back home. ‘How foolish I was,’ he said to himself as he began to drink a bowl of rich milk, ‘to leave a home like this for such terrifying adventures. But my curiosity is satisfied, and now I will stay home and live in luxury as I should.’” OCTOBER 25: Autumn Leaves “Ah,” said the autumn leaves, “now is the time of the year for our great and wonderful party.” “Are you going to have one soon?” asked Mr. Wind. “We hope to have one very, very soon,” said the leaves as they blew about. “The reason I asked,” said Mr. Wind, “was because I did not want to have any other engagement on the day that you give your party. It would be the sort of a party I would enjoy and I trust you will invite me.” “Well,” laughed the leaves, “we couldn’t very well have the sort of a party we want without you. We want your help in the races and jumps and scampers. We need you to say, ‘Ready, Set, Go.’ We could never go without you, Mr. Wind. And so we talked about this party right before you, hoping you would show a great interest.” And Mr. Wind came to the party and helped to make it a huge success. OCTOBER 26: Blackie’s Escape “A little girl named Doris,” said daddy, “was devoted to her pet dog, Blackie. He had long black curly hair and was her constant companion. “Wherever Doris went, Blackie followed. He took long walks with her, and when she stopped to gather ferns and lovely wild flowers, Blackie would romp through the fields, playing and chasing his shadow, sticks, and sometimes his tail! “One day Doris was very busy. She was getting ready for a magic lantern show she was going to give for some of her little friends that evening. “Blackie went out alone. He thought at first he would take a long scamper over the hills and then he decided that he would go and see some of the other dogs in the village where Doris lived. He thought perhaps they would like to take a run, and it would be so much more fun to have companions. He knew his mistress would not be able to leave the house for she had told him so, and Blackie always understood. “He went up into the village and before he had met any of his special friends he came across a big bone. He had met several dogs he knew well enough to sniff at and wag his tail to as he went by, but he was waiting to see some of his really good friends when he happened upon the bone. “‘This looks good,’ he said to himself. ‘I do believe I’ll take it home and spend the afternoon munching on the bone.’ “Blackie ran home and into the side yard. What a time he did have, but it was not long before Doris saw him. “‘What, back again?’ she said. And Blackie wagged his tail. ‘Maybe I’ll get through in time for a little scamper.’ “Of course Blackie knew perfectly well what a scamper meant and he barked delightedly. “‘What have you got there?’ asked Doris as she noticed the bone. “Somehow it had a peculiar look and a very peculiar odor and in a moment Doris thought of poison. That was always the danger about bones that were found. She thought to herself, as she took the bone and looked at it, that there have been people cruel enough to put poison around on bones so dogs would eat it. “She threw the bone away and though Blackie looked very much disappointed he knew that it must be quite a horrid bone if his mistress wouldn’t let him have it. For she knew how much he loved bones and would never take it away from him if she didn’t have to do so. “‘I think I’ll be able to leave now,’ said Doris. For the bone still worried her and she thought perhaps it would be good for Blackie to have a run. “Blackie was very happy again, but when they were a little way out of the village, Blackie didn’t seem to want to run, and he stopped every few moments to eat grass. Dogs usually do that when they are feeling ill. “Again Doris thought of the bone and how worried she was. Blackie didn’t want to run, and was so unlike himself. “Pretty soon she decided to go home and Blackie seemed very glad of that. She telephoned her little friends and said that the magic lantern show would be put off for Blackie was ill. “How badly they all felt, for they knew how much she loved Blackie. But she didn’t forget about the other little dogs. She told all her friends to watch their pets, for she imagined a cruel person who wanted to poison dogs was around. “During the evening Blackie grew worse! Oh, how sick he was! He was so hot, and Doris kept sponging his head with cool water. He would look at her out of his brown eyes and tell her how grateful he was, and he would try to say that he did not want to leave his mistress—life had been so happy for him. “‘Oh, Blackie,’ whispered Doris, as she bathed his head, and as her tears rolled down on his black shaggy hairs, ‘would they kill little dogs who are people’s pets—just because they are so mean and don’t know what it is to understand and love an animal? And they put the poison around anywhere so that the good are just as apt to eat it as perhaps one dog who is naughty.’ “But Blackie got well, and perhaps the cruel person heard about it, for there was no more dog poisoning in that village.” OCTOBER 27: A Talk with the Sun “A little boy named Melville,” said daddy, “had heard that day that every one should make hay while the sun was shining. “‘Make hay while the sun shines,’ was what Melville had been told. The one who had told him this was his teacher in school. “How could any one make hay in the winter time and the sun shone in the winter time as well as in the summer time? he thought. “He wondered about it more and more as he felt the warmth of Mr. Sun shining into his window. He was sitting curled up in a big arm chair. “How he wished he could ask Mr. Sun what it meant. Of course he could ask his teacher to-morrow. There must be some meaning to it, or some catch to it which he didn’t understand. “Mr. Sun looked very pleasant and as though he would be quite willing to tell Melville if only Melville knew how to ask him so he would hear. “How nice and warm Mr. Sun was. More and more sleepy did Melville become, and after a few moments he was sound asleep. Then it seemed as though Mr. Sun came and sat on the window sill. ‘It is true,’ said Mr. Sun, ‘that one can only make hay when the season allows it, and the season doesn’t allow it when it is winter, most assuredly. “‘But the expression, “Make hay while the sun shines,” has nothing to do with the seasons. “‘It is simply an expression meaning to take advantage of the good weather or the good time or the good season and prepare for ones which aren’t so good. “‘For example, when daddies and mothers are well and strong they try to save a little money for the days when illness may come. That is making hay while the sun shines, for they’re saving during the time when they get a chance to save. “‘When children study when they’re young they’re making hay while the sun shines for they’re taking advantage of the opportunities they have which will make them wise when they’re men and women. “‘When people are wise and take advantage of time it is making hay while the sun shines, for it is not losing time. The expression, as you see, means taking advantage of good times to prepare for bad times, and it started by some one telling some one else to see about the hay while the sun was shining, for the rain might come, and then it would be too late. “‘And,’ continued the sun, ‘it is a wise saying, a very wise saying, indeed.’” OCTOBER 28: The Squash “It’s all right to be a winter vegetable or to be a summer vegetable, and it’s all right to be any kind of a vegetable at all a vegetable wishes to be,” said the squash, “but it’s sad above everything to be a squash.” “And why so?” asked one of the potatoes. “Because there is something flat about being a squash. “Just think of the family name, for example—squash! Doesn’t it sound flat and squashed and trampled upon and walked upon and squashed down flat? It has such a hopeless sound!” “It does sound that way,” said the potato. “But still you aren’t all trampled upon and squashed down flat. In fact, I don’t know that I ever saw folks going around and trampling upon you. To be sure, your name has a flat, trampled-upon sound.” “And, oh, dear,” said the squash, “we’re such a dull sort of family. There is no interest to us. We’re not fascinating and pretty, like the tomatoes, and we’re not even loved by some and hated by others, like the cucumbers. “They are interesting, for they have both friends and enemies. “Now we haven’t any who really love us. Most people think we’ll do and that we do no harm and that we’re all right, but no one even gets excited over squash. It is indeed sad to be nothing but a squash!” OCTOBER 29: Jack O’Lantern “I was made by a very fine boy,” said Jack O’Lantern. “I was a little nervous when he was cutting out my nose for fear he’d give me a crooked nose. “But he didn’t. I have a fine nose, haven’t I?” “Indeed, your nose is a thing of beauty,” said Billie Brownie. “And my eyes are nice, eh?” asked Jack O’Lantern. “There is nothing the matter with your eyes,” grinned Billie Brownie. “Good,” said Jack O’Lantern. “And,” he added after a moment, “I do hope you feel like admiring my mouth. It is such a nice big mouth.” “It is a nice big mouth,” laughed Billie Brownie. “Yes, I think you’re a fine fellow, and I love the head piece of a bit of green stalk you wear at the top of your head. It makes you look quite dashing. “And I’m sure your candle will shine through beautifully when it is lighted,” Billie Brownie added. “And then I will go Hallowe’en calling,” said Jack O’Lantern. “What joy that will be! “Yes, I will go calling on many people, and I will sit on their door-steps all by myself with no one to tell me what to do and no one to tell me how to act. “For I will know how to act. I will smile at the people and that is why I am glad my mouth is big, for if I hadn’t a big mouth I mightn’t look as though I were smiling. I mightn’t look as though I were grinning my best grin. “I tell you, Billie Brownie, I’m a cheerful fellow.” OCTOBER 30: Daddy’s Hallowe’en “I am going to tell you,” said daddy, “of the things I did when I was a boy at Hallowe’en time. First of all I used to love bobbing in a tub for apples. I wore a bathing cap so if it was a cold evening my mother wouldn’t be afraid I’d get my hair wet and catch cold because she knew how far down I’d dive into the tub of water! “And we all did the same. The girls needed the bathing caps on their heads more than the boys did and they certainly could dive with hair all held in so dry and safe by their caps. “Then we would play games and one of our favorite games was to run races carrying peanuts on knives. “Two at a time would race against each other. The end of the race would be a big bowl set on the floor and we would start off at the other end of the room. “Then we would each have a lot of peanuts and we would carry as many as we could on our knife until we had gotten rid of all of them. “We had to take all the peanuts to the bowl without letting any drop off. “It was most exciting, for though none of the other children could push us or joggle us they could make funny remarks to us and we would start laughing and sometimes our knife would shake and we’d drop the peanuts and have to start all over again. “Sometimes we would only take one at a time because we could get them all to the bowl more quickly that way in the long run. “Sometimes the one who starts off fastest does not win, you know. And then of course we went calling each with a Jack O’Lantern, and how mad we were at those who hadn’t enough fun in them to like these Hallowe’en callers!” OCTOBER 31: Hallowe’en The preparations for the party to be given at Janet’s house that Hallowe’en evening had already begun. Already they were hanging apples attached firmly by strings from a door-way and as soon as the guests came and the me, my son." "I don't understand you. What sort of a place is this?" "It is a _maison de fous_." Ben was horror-struck. He knew now that he was in a lunatic asylum. He could guess why he was placed there. CHAPTER XXV. IN A TRAP. For a sane person to find himself suddenly incarcerated in a lunatic asylum is enough to excite a thrill of horror in the most stolid. Ben shuddered and started back, pale and sick with apprehension. He was a brave boy, but it required more courage than he possessed to preserve his coolness under such circumstances. "What does it mean?" he ejaculated. "It means, my friend," answered M. Bourdon, with a sardonic smile, "that you are not quite right here," and he tapped his forehead significantly. He spoke English correctly, but with an accent, having, when a young man, passed several years in England. "It is a lie!" exclaimed Ben, indignantly, his terror giving place to anger. "My mind is not in the least affected." M. Bourdon shrugged his shoulders, with another aggravating smile. "They all say so," he answered. "I am as sane as you are!" continued Ben, hotly. "Well, well, I may be a little touched myself--who knows?" said M. Bourdon, or the doctor, as we may call him, in a tone of banter. It was hard for Ben to restrain himself, so impressed was he by the outrage of which he was the victim. It would have been a relief to attack the doctor, and seek deliverance by forcible means, but a glance at the well-knit frame of M. Bourdon, and the certainty of his being able to summon assistance, deterred him and led him to control his rash impulse. One thing he could do, and that was to ascertain, if possible, Major Grafton's motive in subjecting him to imprisonment. "What proof have you that I am insane?" he asked, more calmly. "Your appearance." "You have not had time to examine me." "The doctors are able to judge from very slight examination," said M. Bourdon, smiling. "Did Major Grafton tell you I was insane?" asked Ben. "You mean the gentleman who came here with you?" "Yes." "He has assured me of it." "What did he say? How did he tell you I had shown signs of insanity?" "He said you had tried to drown yourself in the lake, and, being foiled in that, had made an attempt to poison him. Surely this is enough to warrant his sending you to me." "Did he utter these infamous falsehoods?" demanded Ben, startled. "Of course you pronounce them falsehoods, my young friend, and doubtless you believe what you say. I am quite sure you have no recollection of what you did. This is one of your sane periods. At this moment you are as sane as I am." "You admit that?" said Ben, in surprise. "Certainly, for it is true. Your insanity is fitful--paroxysmal. Half an hour hence you may stand in need of a strait-jacket. If you were always as clear in mind as at present there would be no need of detaining you. I would open my door and say, 'Go, my young friend. You do not need my care.' Unfortunately, we do not know how long this mood may last." The doctor spoke smoothly and plausibly, and it was hard for Ben to tell whether he was really in earnest or not. He regarded M. Bourdon intently, and thought he detected a slight mocking smile, which excited his doubt and distrust anew. To appeal to such a man seemed well-nigh hopeless, but there was nothing else to do. "Are you the doctor?" he asked. "Yes; I am Dr. Bourdon," was the reply. "And you are at the head of this establishment?" continued Ben. "I have that honor, my young friend," answered Bourdon. "Then I wish to tell you that Major Grafton has deceived you. He has an object to serve in having me locked up here." "Doubtless," answered the doctor, with an amused smile, taking a pinch of snuff. "He is afraid I would reveal a secret which would strip him of his income," continued Ben. "And that secret is----?" said the doctor, not without curiosity. Ben answered this question as briefly and clearly as he could. The doctor listened with real interest, and it might have been satisfactory to Ben had he known that his story was believed. M. Bourdon was a shrewd man of the world, and it struck him that this knowledge might enable him to demand more extortionate terms of Major Grafton. "Don't you believe me?" asked Ben, watching the face of his listener. "I hear a great many strange stories," said the doctor. "I have to be cautious about what I believe." "But surely you will believe me, knowing that I am perfectly sane?" "That is the question to be determined," said M. Bourdon, smiling. "Won't you investigate it?" pleaded Ben. "It is a crime to keep me here, when I am of sound mind." "Whenever I am convinced of that I will let you go. Meanwhile you must be quiet, and submit to the rules of my establishment." "How long do you expect to keep me here?" asked Ben. "As long as you require it and your board is paid." Ben looked despondent, for this assurance held out very little hope of release. Still he was young, and youth is generally hopeful. Something might turn up. Ben was determined that something should turn up. He was not going to remain shut up in a mad-house any longer than he could help. He remained silent, and M. Bourdon touched a little bell upon a small table beside the door. The summons was answered by a stout man with rough, black locks, who looked like a hotel porter. "Francois," said the doctor, in the French language, "conduct this young man to No. 19." "At once, _Monsieur le Docteur_," answered the attendant. "Come with me, young man." He signed to Ben to follow him, and our hero, realizing the utter futility of resistance, did so. "Go ahead, monsieur," said Francois, when they came to a staircase. Ben understood him very well, though he spoke in French, thanks to his assiduous study of the last four weeks. They walked along a narrow corridor, and Francois, taking from his pocket a bunch of keys, carefully selected one and opened the door. "_Entrez monsieur._" Ben found himself in an apartment about the size of a hall bedroom, with one window, and a narrow bedstead, covered with an exceedingly thin mattress. There was no carpet on the floor, and the furniture was very scanty. It consisted of but one chair, a cheap bureau, and a washstand. And this was to be Ben's home--for how long? "I must get acquainted with this man," thought Ben. "I must try to win his goodwill, and perhaps he may be able to help me to escape." "Is your name Francois?" he asked, as the man lingered at the door. "_Oui, monsieur._" "And how long have you been here--in this asylum?" "How long, monsieur? Five years, nearly." "There is some mistake about my being here, Francois. I don't look crazy, do I?" "No, monsieur; but----" "But what?" "That proves nothing." "There is a plot against me, and I am put here by an enemy. I want you to be my friend. Here, take this." Ben produced from his pocket a silver franc piece and offered it to Francois, who took it eagerly, for the man's besetting sin was avarice. "Thanks, monsieur--much thanks!" he said, his stolid face lighting up. "I will be a friend." "Francois!" At the call from below Francois hastily thrust the coin into his pocket, nodded significantly to Ben, and, retiring, locked the door behind him. CHAPTER XXVI. INTRODUCES TWO CELEBRITIES. What a change a short half-hour may make in the position and feelings of any person! Little did Ben imagine, when he set out on a drive in the morning with Major Grafton, that he was on his way to one of the most hopeless of prisons. It was hard even now for him to realize his position. He looked from the window, and with a glance of envy saw in a field, not far away, some Swiss peasants at work. They were humble people, living a quiet, uneventful, laborious life; yet Ben felt that they were infinitely better off than he, provided he were doomed to pass the remainder of his life in this refuge. But of this he would not entertain the idea. He was young, not yet seventeen, and life was full of pleasant possibilities. "I am a Yankee," he thought, "and I don't believe they will succeed in keeping me here long. I will keep a bright lookout for a chance to escape." Half an hour later Ben heard the key grate in the lock, and, fixing his eyes on the entrance, he saw Francois enter. "Monsieur, dinner is ready," he said. Ben, notwithstanding his disagreeable situation, felt that he, too, was ready for the dinner. He was glad to find that it was not to be served to him in his own room. He would have a chance of seeing the other inmates of the house. "Where is it?" he asked. "Follow me," answered Francois, of course in French. He led the way, and Ben followed him into a lower room, long and narrow, which was used as the dining-room. There were no side-windows, and it would have been quite dark but for a narrow strip of window near the ceiling. Around a plain table sat a curious collection of persons. It was easy to see that something was the matter with them, for I do not wish to have it understood that all the inmates of the house were, like our hero, perfectly sane. M. Bourdon was not wholly a quack, but he was fond of money, and, looking through the eyes of self-interest, he was willing to consider Ben insane, although he knew very well that he was as rational as himself. "Sit here, monsieur," said Francois. Ben took the seat indicated, and naturally turned to survey his immediate neighbors. The one on the right-hand was a tall, venerable-looking man, with white hair and a flowing beard, whose manner showed the most perfect decorum. The other was a thin, dark-complexioned man, of bilious aspect, and shifty, evasive eyes. Neither noticed Ben at first, as the dinner appeared to engross their first attention. This consisted of a thin broth and a section of a loaf of coarse bread as the first course. Ben had been accustomed to more luxurious fare, and he was rather surprised to see with what enjoyment his neighbors partook of it. Next came a plate of meat, and this was followed by a small portion of grapes. There was nothing more. It was clear that M. Bourdon did not consider rich fare good for his patients. "I think I would rather dine at the hotel," thought Ben; but the diet was not by any means the worst thing of which he complained. "If I were free I would not mind how poor and plain my fare was," he thought. His companions finished dinner before him, and had leisure to bestow some attention upon him. "My little gentleman, do you come from Rome?" asked the venerable old gentleman on his right. "No, sir," answered Ben. "I am sorry. I wished to ask you a question." "Indeed, sir. Perhaps I might answer it even now. I have been in Florence." "No; that will not do; and yet, perhaps you may have met persons coming from Rome?" "I did, monsieur." "Then perhaps they told you how things were going on." "Very well, I believe, monsieur." "No, that could not be," said the old gentleman, shaking his head. "I am sure nothing would go well without me." "Do you, then, live in Rome?" asked Ben, curiously. "Surely!" exclaimed the old man. "Did you not know that the Pope lived in Rome?" "But what has that to do with you, sir?" "A great deal. Know, my little gentleman, that I--to whom you are speaking--am the Pope." This was said with an air of importance. "There's no doubt about his being insane," thought Ben. "How, then, do you happen to be here?" asked our hero, interested to see what his companion would say. "I was abducted," said the old gentleman, lowering his voice, "by an emissary of the King of America. M. Bourdon is a cousin of the king, and he is in the plot. But they won't keep me here long." "I hope not," said Ben, politely. "The King of Spain has promised to send an army to deliver me. I only received his letter last week. You will not tell M. Bourdon, will you?" "Certainly not," answered Ben. "It is well; I thought I could rely upon your honor." "My friend," said another voice, that of his left-hand neighbor, "you are losing your time in talking with that old fool. The fact is, he isn't right here," and he touched his head. The Pope appeared deeply absorbed in thought, and did not hear this complimentary remark. "He thinks he is the Pope. He is no more the Pope than I am." Ben nodded non-committally. "He ought to be here. But I--I am the victim of an infamous horde of enemies, who have placed me here." "Why should they do that, sir?" "To keep me out of my rights. It is the English Government that has done it. Of course, you know who I am." "No, sir, I don't think I do." "Look well at me!" and the dark man threw himself back in his chair for inspection. "I am afraid I don't recognize you, monsieur," said Ben. "Bah! where are your eyes?" said the other, contemptuously. "I am Napoleon Bonaparte!" "But I thought you died at St. Helena," said Ben. "Quite a mistake, I assure you. The English Government so asserted, but it was a deception. They wished my memory to die out among my faithful French. They buried my effigy, but smuggled me off in a vessel late at night. They placed me here, and here they mean to keep me--if they can. But some day I shall escape; I shall re-enter France; I shall summon all to my banner, and at the head of a great army I shall enter Paris. Do you know what I will do then?" "What will you do, sir?" asked Ben, with some curiosity. "I shall descend upon England with an army of five millions of men," said the dark man, his eyes flashing, "and burn all her cities and towns." "That will be rather severe, won't it?" asked Ben. "She deserves it; but I may do worse." "How can that be?" "Do you see that man over on the other side of the table--the short, red-haired man?" "Yes, I see him." "He is a chemist and has invented a compound a thousand times more powerful than dynamite. I am negotiating for it, and, if I succeed, I mean to blow the whole island out of the water. What do you think of that, eh?" he continued, triumphantly. "I think in that case I shall keep away from England," answered Ben, keeping as straight a face as he could. "Ah, you will do well." When dinner was over, the boarders passed out of the room, Ben among them. He was destined not to go out quietly. Suddenly a wild-looking woman darted toward him and threw her arms around his neck, exclaiming: "At last I have found you, my son, my son!" Ben struggled to release himself, assisted by Francois, who did not scruple to use considerable force. "None of your tricks, madam!" he cried, angrily. "Will you take from me my boy?" she exclaimed, piteously. "There is some mistake. I am not your son," said Ben. The woman shook her head sadly. "He disowns his poor mother," she said, mournfully. On the whole, Ben was rather glad to return to his chamber. "I don't like my fellow-boarders," he thought. "I sha'n't stay in the _maison de fous_ any longer than I am obliged to." CHAPTER XXVII. A MIDNIGHT ESCAPE. For three days Ben passed a dull, uniform existence, being most of the time confined to his chamber. To a boy of active temperament it was most irksome. If he only had something to read, the hours would pass more swiftly. Fortunately, on the second day, he bethought himself of Francois, who seemed friendly. "Francois," he said, "can't you get me something to read?" "I don't know," said the attendant, doubtfully. "What would monsieur like?" "Anything you can find. I would prefer a story." "I will try, monsieur." The next time Francois made his appearance he held in his hand a tattered edition of a popular novel. "Will that do?" he asked. Ben had never heard of the book, but on opening its pages it looked attractive, and he answered: "Yes, Francois, I am much obliged to you." He thought it politic, remembering that he might need other favors, to put a franc piece into the hand of the friendly attendant. Francois brightened up. His wages were so small that these little gratuities were very welcome. "Would monsieur like something else?" he inquired. "There is one thing I would like very much, Francois," answered Ben. "What is that, monsieur?" "To get out of this place." "But monsieur is insane." "I am no more insane than you are. Do I look insane?" "No; but one cannot always tell." "I would give a hundred francs to any one who would get me out of this," said Ben, not, however, expecting to produce much impression on the mind of his auditor. "A hundred francs!" repeated Francois, his eyes sparkling. But in a moment he looked sober. "It would not do. I should be discharged," he said. "Think it over, Francois," said Ben. The attendant did not answer, but the suggestion had borne fruit. It may be asked how Ben had so much money. It may be explained that he was about to send a remittance home, having received a payment from Major Grafton, but his unexpected arrival at the refuge had prevented him. He had with him two hundred francs, or about forty dollars in gold. Something happened on the third day which worked favorably for Ben's hopes of securing the active assistance of Francois. About dusk a boy appeared at the gate of the asylum, and asked to see Francois. When the two were brought together, he said: "I came from your wife. She wishes you to come home. The child--little Marie--is very sick." Poor Francois was much disturbed. In a little cottage five miles away lived his wife and his only child, Marie. The poor fellow was deeply attached to his child, for it must be remembered that the poor and simple-minded are quite as apt to have as strong affections as the richer and more favored. "Is she very bad, Jean?" he asked, quite pale. "Yes," answered Jean. "I think she is out of her head. She keeps moaning. Her poor mother is very much frightened." "I will ask if I can come," said Francois, and he straightway sought out the doctor. "I would like to speak to you, M. Bourdon," he said. "Speak quick, then, for I am busy," said the doctor, gruffly, for something had happened to disturb him. "Jean Gault has just told me that my little Marie is very sick, and my wife wants me to come home. If I could go now, I would come back in the morning." "Well, you can't go," said the doctor, harshly. "But, _Monsieur le Docteur_, do you understand that my child--my little Marie--is very sick? She moans, and is out of her head, and I may never see her again, if I don't go." "Plague take your little Marie!" said M. Bourdon, brutally. "What have I to do with her? I want you to stay here. You know very well that you can't be spared." "But," protested Francois, indignantly, "do you think because I am poor that I have no feeling? You are very much mistaken. I cannot stay away and let poor Marie die without seeing her." "You can't go, at all events," said M. Bourdon, roughly. "I cannot go?" "No; or, if you do, you will lose your place. I cannot have my men going away on every silly pretext. I don't believe your child is sick at all." "But Jean Gault is below. He has brought word from my wife." "I dare say it is all planned between you." "Then you will not let me go?" "No, I won't. If you go, you lose your place. I shall not take you back. Do you understand?" "Yes, I understand," said Francois, slowly. "Then you can go. We have had words enough about this." If the doctor had not been irritated he would have been careful how he dealt with Francois, who was the most valuable man in his employ. But when we are irritated we lose sight of what is politic, and are apt to make grievous mistakes, as M. Bourdon certainly did on this occasion. Francois sought out little Jean. "Jean," he said, "go home and tell my wife that I will come some time to-night. The doctor has forbidden me to go, but I shall go, all the same. Be sure you tell no one else." "Very well, Francois," answered the boy. "Tell my wife I may be late, but I will surely come." The boy went away, and Francois went up to Ben's room. "Monsieur, I have something to say to you," he commenced. "What is it, Francois?" "You said you would give a hundred francs to any one who would get you out of this?" "Yes, Francois," answered Ben, quickly. "Have you so much money with you, then?" asked Francois, doubtfully. "See here!" and Ben took out five napoleons, which he displayed in his open palm. The attendant's eyes sparkled. "And you will give them to me, if perchance I set you free?" "Yes." "Listen, then. I would not do it, but my little Marie is very sick, and my wife wants me to come home. Perhaps she may die;" and the poor fellow suppressed a sob. "But M. Bordon--that is the doctor--he says I shall not go. He said 'Plague take your child!'" continued Francois, wrathfully. "Poor Francois," said Ben compassionately. "Ah! you feel for me, little monsieur," said Francois, gratefully. "The doctor has a heart like a stone. He says if I go I shall not come back; but I do not care, I cannot stay away. I will go, and you shall go with me. Can you walk five miles?" "I can walk ten--fifteen, if necessary," said Ben, promptly. "Then be ready at midnight. We will go together. It will not do to go earlier. Then the doctor will be asleep. Every one else will be asleep, and we can go away unobserved. M. Bourdon will be sorry that he did not let me go. I promised to come back." And Francois's eyes sparkled with honest indignation. Ben's heart beat high with hope. "You will come to my room at midnight?" he said. "Yes, monsieur." "I will be ready." "One thing, monsieur. Do not have your shoes on. You can carry them in your hand. We must not make any noise when we are going down stairs, or we may be caught." "That is well thought of, Francois. Depend upon me. I will be ready." It will easily be supposed that Ben did not go to bed. He sat waiting patiently hour after hour till, as midnight struck, his door was softly opened, and Francois appeared. "Now," said the attendant, "follow me, and make no noise." Ben, in his stocking feet, followed the attendant down stairs. Producing a large key, Francois opened the outside door, then closed it softly, and they stood outside under a star-lit sky. CHAPTER XXVIII. BEN'S FLIGHT. As good luck would have it, Ben and Francois departed without being observed. On emerging from the asylum they at first ran, after putting on their shoes, but when a quarter of a mile had been traversed they dropped into a walk. "Well, we got away safely," said Ben. "Yes; the doctor was asleep. We shall not be missed till morning." "And then it shall be my fault if I am caught. Where is your home, Francois?" "Five miles away." "Yes, but is it on my way?" "Where would monsieur go?" "To Paris." "To Paris!" ejaculated Francois, with wonderment. "That is a great way off, is it not?" "Yes, I think it must be a thousand miles away." "But monsieur is a boy; he cannot walk so far." "No," answered Ben, laughing. "I don't propose to. Is there any railroad station near your house?" "Yes, monsieur; only five minutes off." "That will do very well." "And has monsieur money enough?" "Not to go all the way to Paris, but half-way there, perhaps." "And is not monsieur afraid he will starve--without money?" "I think I can get along," said Ben, slowly, for it dawned upon him that it would not be a very pleasant thing to be penniless in a foreign country. "I will give back half the money monsieur has given me," said Francois, in a friendly tone. "No, Francois; you will need it all. I am not afraid." After a walk of an hour and a half the two pedestrians reached a small village set among the hills. Francois began to walk faster, and to look more eager. "Does monsieur see that cottage?" he said. Ben's eyes rested on an humble cottage just out of the village. "Yes." "It is mine. Will monsieur come with me?" "Yes, I will go to see if your little girl is alive." Soon they were at the door. There was a light burning in the main room. A plain, neat woman opened the door. "Thank Heaven!" she exclaimed, "it is Francois." "Is--is Marie alive?" "Yes, my husband. She has had a change for the better." "Heaven be praised!" "And who is this young gentleman?" "A friend," answered Francois, after some hesitation. "Then I'm glad to see him. Welcome, monsieur." "Come in, monsieur," said Francois. "I think I had better go to the station." "The cars will not start till seven o'clock. Monsieur will need repose." "But I don't wish to incommode you." "My wife will give you a blanket, and you can lie here." Ben accepted the invitation, and stretched himself out on a settee. "I will wake you in time," said Francois. "Be tranquil." CHAPTER XXIX. BEN IS MISSED. Meanwhile M. Bourdon slept the sleep of the just--or the unjust--not dreaming of the loss his establishment had sustained. He did not open his eyes till five o'clock. Usually at that hour Francois was stirring, as he had morning duties to perform. But M. Bourdon did not hear him bustling around as usual. At first this did not strike him, but after awhile he began to wonder why. "The lazy dog!" he said to himself. "He is indulging himself this morning, and his work will suffer." He went to the door of his chamber and called "Francois!" Francois slept in an upper room, but still the asylum was not a lofty building, and he should have heard. "He must be fast asleep, as usual," grumbled M. Bourdon. "I must go up and rouse him. It would be well if I had a horsewhip." Slipping on a part of his clothing, the doctor crept up stairs. He knocked at the door of his dilatory servant. "Francois! Francois, I say. Are you dead?" There was no answer. "I suppose he has locked his door," muttered the doctor, as he tried the latch. But no! the door opened, and, to his dismay, the room was empty. The bed had not been disturbed. The doctor's face was dark with anger. "The ingrate has left me, after all. He has gone to his child, who is not sick at all, I dare say. Well, he will repent it. I will not take him back." Here the doctor paused. It would be exceedingly inconvenient to lose Francois, who, besides being a capable man, accepted very small pay. "At any rate I will lower his wages!" he said. "He shall regret the way he has served me." It was a temporary inconvenience. Still there was an outside man whom he could impress into the service as a substitute, and in a day or two Francois would be glad to return. It was not, perhaps, so serious a matter, after all. But M. Bourdon changed his mind when he found the front door unlocked. "Who had escaped, if any?" This was the question he asked himself. In great haste he went from one room to another, but all seemed to be occupied. It was only when he opened Ben's room that he ascertained that the one whom he would most regret to lose had decamped. Ben's bed, too, was but little disturbed. He had slept on the outside, if he had slept at all, but not within the bed, as was but too evident. "Has any one seen the boy?" demanded M. Bourdon of an outdoor servant who slept outside, but was already on duty. "Not I, _Monsieur le Docteur_." "Then he must have escaped with Francois! Put my horse in the carriage at once." Ten minutes later M. Bourdon was on his way to the cottage of Francois. Fifteen minutes before he arrived Francois had aroused our young hero. "It is time to get up, little monsieur," he said. "In half an hour the cars will start." Refreshed by his sound sleep, Ben sprang up at once--he did not need to dress--and was ready for the adventures of the day. "Where is the station, Francois?" he said. "I will go with monsieur." "No; if the doctor should come, delay him so that he cannot overtake me." "Perhaps it is best." Ben followed the directions of his humble friend, and soon brought up at the station. He purchased a third-class ticket for a place fifty miles away, and waited till it was time for the train to start. Meanwhile M. Bourdon had driven up to the cottage of Francois. The door was opened to him by Francois himself. "Where is that boy? Did he come away with you?" he asked, abruptly. "What boy?" asked Francois, vacantly. "The one who came a few days since. You know who I mean." Francois shrugged his shoulders. "Is he gone?" he asked. "Of course he is, fool." Just then the wife of Francois came to the door. Unfortunately her husband had not warned her, nor did she know that Ben had been an inmate of the asylum. "Where is the boy who came here last night with your husband?" asked M. Bourdon, abruptly. "Gone to the station," answered the woman, unsuspiciously. The doctor jumped into his carriage, and drove with speed to the station. CHAPTER XXX. M. BOURDON'S LITTLE SCHEME. Meanwhile Ben had entered a third-class carriage--it behooved him to be economical now--and sat down. He was congratulating himself on his fortunate escape, when M. Bourdon dashed up to the station. He entered the building, and was about passing to the platform, when he was stopped. "Your ticket, monsieur." Just then came the signal for the train to start. "Never mind the ticket!" shouted the doctor. "Don't stop me. One of my patients is running away." "I can't help it," said the guard, imperturbably. "Monsieur cannot pass without a ticket." "But I don't want to go anywhere," roared M. Bourdon. "I want to see the passengers." To the railway attendant this seemed a very curious request. He began to think the doctor, with his excitable manner, was insane. At any rate, he was obliged to obey the rules. "Go back and buy a ticket, monsieur," he said, unmoved. "But I don't want to go anywhere," protested M. Bourdon. "Then go back!" And the official, placing his hand on the doctor's sacred person, thrust him forcibly aside. "Fool! Dolt!" screamed M. Bourdon, who could hear the train starting. "You must be crazy!" said the guard, shrugging his shoulders. It was too late now. The train had actually gone, and M. Bourdon turned back, foiled, humiliated and wrathful. He regretted bitterly now that he had not let Francois off the evening before, as in that case Ben would not have had a chance to escape. Now he must lose the generous sum which Major Grafton had agreed to pay for his ward. It was more than he received for any other of his patients, for M. Bourdon, recognizing Ben's sanity, shrewdly surmised that the guardian had some special design in having his ward locked up, and took advantage of it to increase the weekly sum which he charged. And now all this was lost. But no! A happy thought struck the worthy doctor. Ben had escaped, it is true, but why could not he go on charging for him just as before? His escape was not known to Major Grafton, and probably would not be discovered for a long time at least. The major was not very likely to visit the asylum, as an interview between him and his young victim would be rather embarrassing to him. Yes, that was the course he would pursue. He would from time to time send in a report of his patient, and regularly collect his board, while he would be at no expense whatever for him. It was necessary, however, to take Francois into his confidence, and he drove back to the cottage of the humble attendant. Francois was watching outside. He was afraid the doctor would succeed in capturing the boy, in whom he had begun to feel a strong interest. When he saw M. Bourdon drive up alone he smiled to himself, though his features remained outwardly grave. "Did you find him, sir?" he asked, respectfully. "No," answered M. Bourdon, roughly. "The train had just started." "And was he a passenger?" "Doubtless." "What will you do, _Monsieur le Docteur_?" Francois asked, curiously. "Francois," said M. Bourdon, suddenly, "I am sorry for you." "Why?" asked Francois, considerably surprised. "Is it because my little Marie is sick?" "Plague take your little Marie! It is because you have helped the boy to escape." "How could I help him, sir?" "Some one must have unlocked the door of his room. Otherwise, he could not have got out." "I don't know, monsieur," said Francois, assuming ignorance. "When did you first see him?" "I had walked about a quarter of a mile," said Francois, mendaciously, "when he ran up and overtook me. I told him to go back, but he would not. He followed me, and came here." "This story is by no means ingenious," said the doctor, shaking his head. "When you stand up in a court of justice you will see how the lawyers will make you eat your words. And very likely they will send you to prison." "Oh, no! Don't say that!" said poor Francois, much frightened. "What would become of my poor wife and child?" "You should have thought of them before this." "Oh, _Monsieur le Docteur_, you will save me from prison!" exclaimed poor, simple-minded Francois. "On one condition." "Name it, monsieur." "Let no one know that the boy has escaped." "I will not, if you desire it." "You see, it will be bad for me as well as for you. It was very important to keep him--very important, indeed--and his friends will call me to account. But they need not know it, if you remain silent." "No one shall hear me say a word, _Monsieur le Docteur_," said Francois, promptly. "That is well. In that case I will overlook your disobedience, and allow you to return to your place." "Oh, monsieur is too good!" said Francois, who did not by any means anticipate such magnanimous forgiveness. "When can you come back?" "When monsieur will." "Come, then, this evening. It will be in time. I will allow you to spend the day with your family, since your child is sick." The doctor turned his horse's head, and drove back to the asylum. Three days after he wrote to Major Grafton: "MY DEAR SIR: Your ward is rather sullen, but quiet. He was at first disposed to make trouble, but the firm and effective discipline of the institution has had the usual result. I allow him to amuse himself with reading, as this seems to be the best way of keeping him quiet and contented. His insanity is of a mild kind, but it is often precisely such cases that are most difficult to cure. You may rely, Monsieur Grafton, upon my taking the best care of the young gentleman, and, as you desired, I will especially guard against his obtaining writing materials, lest, by a misrepresentation of his condition, he might excite his friends. "I thank you for your promptness in forwarding my weekly payments. Write me at any time when you desire a detailed account of your ward's condition." M. Bourdon signed this letter, after reading it over to himself, with a complacent smile. He reflected that it did great credit to his ingenuity. "Some men would have revealed the truth," he said to himself, "and lost a fine income. I am wiser." In due time this letter reached Major Grafton. "That is well," he said to himself. "I am rather sorry for the boy, but he has brought it on himself. Why must he be a fool, and threaten to blab? He was living in luxury, such as he has never been accustomed to before, and he might rest content with that. In me surely he had an indulgent master. I rarely gave him anything to do. He could live on the fat of the land, see the world at no expense to himself, and have all the advantages of a rich man's son. Well, he has made his own bed, and now he must lie in it. On some accounts it is more agreeable to me to travel alone, and have no one to bother me." To avert suspicion, Major Grafton left the Hotel des Bergues and took up his quarters at another hotel. At the end of two weeks he left for Italy, having arranged matters satisfactorily by sending M. Bourdon a month's payment in advance, an arrangement that suited the worthy doctor remarkably well. CHAPTER XXXI. A WANDERER IN FRANCE. A boy toiled painfully over a country road but a few miles from the city of Lyons. His clothes bore the marks of the dusty road over which he was travelling. It was clear by his appearance that he was not a French boy. There is no need of keeping up a mystery which my young readers will easily penetrate. This boy was our hero, Ben Baker. He was now more than half way to Paris, and might have reached that gay city days since but for his limited supply of money. When he gave Francois a hundred francs he nearly exhausted his limited capital, but there was no help for it. He had travelled a hundred miles on the railway, far enough to be beyond the danger of pursuit and the risk of a return to the asylum, which he could not think of without a shudder. Now he would walk, and so economize. He had walked another hundred miles, and had reached this point in his journey. But his scanty funds were now reduced to a piece of two sous, and he was between three and four thousand miles from home. This very day he had walked fifteen miles, and all he had eaten was a roll, which he had purchased in a baker's shop in a country village through which he had passed in the early morning. Hopeful as Ben was by temperament, he looked sober enough as he contemplated his position. How was he ever to return home, and what prospect was there for him in Europe? If he had been in any part of America he would have managed to find something to do, but here he felt quite helpless. He had walked fifteen miles on an almost empty stomach, and the result was that he was not only tired but sleepy. He sat down by the way-side, with his back against the trunk of a tree, and before he was conscious of it he had fallen asleep. How long he had been asleep he did not know, but he was roused suddenly by a touch. Opening his eyes, he saw a man fumbling at his watch-chain. The man, who was a stout and unprepossessing-looking man of about thirty-five, wearing a blouse, jumped back with a hasty, confused exclamation. "What are you doing?" demanded Ben, suspiciously. He spoke first in English, but, remembering himself, repeated the question in French. "Pardon, monsieur," said the man, looking uncomfortable. Ben's glance fell on his chain and the watch, which had slipped from his pocket, and he understood that the man had been trying to steal his watch. In spite of his poverty and need of money he had not yet parted with the watch, though he suspected the time would soon come when he should be compelled to do so. "You were trying to steal my watch," said Ben, severely. "No, monsieur, you are wrong," answered the tramp, for that was what he would be called in America. "How came my watch out of the pocket, and why were you leaning over me?" continued Ben. "I wanted to see what time it was," answered the man, after a minute's hesitation. "I think it is fortunate I awoke when I did," said Ben. His new acquaintance did not choose to notice the significance of the words. "Monsieur," he said, "I am a poor man. Will you help me with a few sous?" Ben could not help laughing. It seemed too ridiculous that any one should ask money of him. He took the two-sous piece from his pocket. "Do you see that?" he asked. "Yes, monsieur." "It is all the money I have." The man looked incredulous. "And yet monsieur is well dressed, and has a gold watch." "Still I am as poor as you, for I am more than three thousand miles from home, and have not money enough to get there, even if I sell my watch." "Where does monsieur live?" asked the tramp, looking interested. "In America." "Will monsieur take my advice?" "If it is good." "There is a rich American gentleman at the Hotel de la Couronne, in Lyons. He would, perhaps, help monsieur." The idea struck Ben favorably. This gentleman could, at any rate, give him advice, and he felt that he needed it. "How far is Lyons away?" "Scarcely a league." "Straight ahead?" "Yes, monsieur." "Then I will go there." "And I, too. I will guide monsieur." "Thank you. I will reward you, if I have the means." CHAPTER XXXII. A STRANGE MEETING. The Hotel de la Couronne is situated in one of the finest parts of Lyons. As Ben stood before it, he began to doubt whether he had not better go away with his errand undone. After all, this American gentleman, if there were one in the hotel, would be likely to feel very little interest in a destitute boy claiming to be a fellow-countryman. He might even look upon him as a designing rogue, with a fictitious story of misfortune, practising upon his credulity. Ben's cheek flushed at the mere thought that he might be so regarded. So he was on the point of going away; but he was nerved by his very desperation to carry out his original plan. He entered the hotel, and went up to the office. "Will monsieur look at some apartments?" asked the landlord's son, a man of thirty. "No, monsieur--that is, not at present. Is there an American gentleman at present staying in the hotel?" "Yes. Is monsieur an American?" Ben replied in the affirmative, and asked for the name of his countryman. "It is Monsieur Novarro," was the reply. "Novarro!" repeated Ben to himself. "That sounds more like a Spanish or an Italian name." "Is that the gentleman monsieur desires to see?" "From what part of America does Mr. Novarro come?" The register was applied to, and the answer given was "Havana." "Havana!" said Ben, disappointed. "Then he will take no interest in me," he thought. "There is very little kindred between a Cuban and an American." "Would monsieur like to see M. Novarro?" "I may as well see him," thought Ben, and he answered in the affirmative. "There is M. Novarro, now," said the landlord's son; and Ben, turning, saw a tall, very dark-complexioned man, who had just entered. "M. Novarro, here is a young gentleman who wishes to see you--a countryman of yours." The Cuban regarded Ben attentively, and not without surprise. "Have we met before?" he asked, courteously. "No, sir," answered Ben, relieved to find that the Cuban spoke English; "and I am afraid I am taking a liberty in asking for you." "By no means! If I can be of any service to you, my friend, you may command me." "It is rather a long story, Mr. Novarro," Ben commenced. "Then we will adjourn to my room, where we shall be more at our ease." Ben followed his new acquaintance to a handsome private parlor on the second floor and seated himself in a comfortable arm-chair, indicated by the Cuban. "I will first mention my name," said Ben. "It is Benjamin Baker." "Baker!" exclaimed the Cuban, in evident excitement. "Who was your father?" "My father was Dr. John Baker, and lived in Sunderland, Connecticut." "Is is possible!" ejaculated the Cuban; "you are his son?" "Did you know my father?" asked Ben, in amazement. "I never saw him, but I knew of him. I am prepared to be a friend to his son. Now tell me your story." CHAPTER XXXIII. AN ASTOUNDING DISCOVERY. Ben told his story so far as it concerned his engagement by Major Grafton and his visit to Europe. Of his mother and her circumstances and of his uncle he had scarcely occasion to speak, considering that his auditor would hardly feel interested in his own personal history. The Cuban, who had a grave, kindly aspect, listened with close attention to his narrative. When Ben ceased speaking he said: "My young friend, there is one thing that puzzles me in this story of yours." "What is it, sir?" asked Ben, anxiously. He feared that the stranger did not believe him. "Why should you need to travel with Major Grafton, or any other gentleman, as private secretary, unless, indeed, your mother did not wish you to come to Europe alone?" Ben stared at his interlocutor in amazement. "How could I come to Europe alone?" he asked. "Where should I find the money to pay my expenses?" "Your mother might pay the expenses of your trip." "My mother is very poor, Mr. Novarro." "Very poor! Has she, then, lost the money that your father left her?" "I think you must be under a great mistake, Mr. Novarro. My uncle allows my mother a small income, and I help her all I can." "There is certainly a great mistake somewhere," said the Cuban. "To my certain knowledge your father possessed a hundred thousand dollars in first-class securities. Didn't you know anything of this?" continued Mr. Novarro, observing Ben's look of extreme amazement. "I know nothing of it, Mr. Novarro." "Then he must have been robbed of the securities which I myself gave him on the 18th day of May, in the year 18--" "That was the day of my father's death," said Ben. "He died on that very day?" said the Cuban in excitement. "Tell me the particulars of your father's death. Did he die a natural death?" "Yes, sir; he died of heart disease." "And where?" "In the house of my Uncle Nicholas." "Before he had time to go home? Before he had acquainted your mother with his good fortune?" "Neither my mother nor myself knew but that he died a poor man." "But he had the securities with him. Did your uncle say nothing of them?" "Not a word." A look of suspicion appeared on the face of Filippo Novarro. "Tell me," he said, quickly--"did your uncle, shortly after your father's death, enlarge his business?" "Yes, sir; he moved from a small store in Grand street to a larger store on Broadway--the one which he now occupies." With the Cuban, suspicion was now changed to certainty. He brought down his fist heavily upon the table at his side. "I know all now," he said. "Your uncle deliberately robbed your dead father of the securities which I had placed in his hands, and coolly appropriating them to his own use, used the proceeds to build up and extend his business, leaving your mother to live in poverty." "I feel bewildered," said Ben. "I can hardly believe my uncle would treat us so shamefully." "By the way, when did your mother move to Minnesota?" asked the Cuban. "To Minnesota?" "Yes. When I was in New York, not long since, I called upon your uncle and signified my intention to call upon your mother. He told me she had moved to Minnesota, and, of course, I was compelled to give up my plan." "My mother has never moved to Minnesota; she still lives in Sunderland." "Then your uncle intended to prevent our meeting. He feared, doubtless, that if we met, his rascality would be discovered. Providence has defeated his cunningly-devised scheme, and the truth will soon be brought to light, to his confusion." "I am afraid, sir, it will be difficult for my mother and myself to prove that my father left money. We have no money, with which to hire legal assistance." "I propose to take the matter into my own hands. I am personally interested as the agent whom my dead friend commissioned to pay a debt of gratitude to the man who saved his life. Have you anything to detain you in Europe?" "No, sir, except an empty purse." "Permit me to act as your banker." Mr. Novarro drew from his pocket two hundred and fifty francs in gold and paper and handed them to Ben. To our hero it seemed like a fairy-tale, in which he was playing the leading part. He half-feared that the gold would turn into brass and the bank-notes into withered leaves; but, strange though it was, he saw good reason to think that his good fortune was real. "How can I thank you, sir, for your liberality?" he said, gratefully. "You forget that this is your own money; I am only advancing it to you, and shall be repaid speedily. Will you accept me as your guardian to protect your interests and compel your uncle to disgorge his ill-gotten gains?" "Thankfully, sir, if you are willing to take the trouble." "Then you will sail with me for New York by the next steamer. Have you your luggage with you?" "I have nothing, sir, except what I have on my back. I had to leave the asylum without a change, and I have not been able to change my clothes for a week or more." "I had forgotten. This must be looked to at once. We will take lunch, and then go out and purchase a new supply of under-clothing." Once more Ben had fallen on his feet. At what appeared to be the darkest moment light had suddenly fallen across his path, and he had stumbled upon the one man who was able to bring him into the sunshine. Before night his wardrobe had been quite replenished, and he breathed a deep sigh of relief as he found himself in fresh and clean attire. He sought out the tramp who had escorted him to the hotel, and liberally rewarded him. "I shall telegraph for passage in the Havre line of steamships," said Mr. Novarro. "A steamer is to sail on Saturday, so that we shall not have long to wait." "I fear, Mr. Novarro, you are interrupting your own plans in order to befriend me," said Ben to his new patron. "I have no plans. I am--perhaps unfortunately for myself--a rich man, under no necessity of labor. Indeed, my chief aim has been to pass my time as pleasantly as possible. Now I find something to do, and I find myself happier for having some object in life. I am rejoiced that we have met. It has brought to my life a new interest; and even after I have redeemed your wrongs I shall hope to keep up my acquaintance with you, and to make the acquaintance of your mother." "You may be sure, sir, that my mother will be only too glad to know so true a friend." The Cuban regarded Ben with a look of interest and affection. He was beginning to be attracted to him for his own sake. He was a man of energetic temperament, though a large inheritance had hitherto prevented any display of energy. At length the occasion had arisen, and he looked forward with eagerness to the struggle with the New York merchant to secure the rights of his new friend. On the next day Ben and his guardian left Lyons for Paris. They had two days in this lovely city, and late on Friday evening they reached Havre, the point where they were to embark for America. "The first act is over, Ben," said the Cuban. "Our ocean trip is a long wait between the first and second acts. When the curtain next rises it will be in New York, and there will be other actors to take an unwilling part in our drama, which is devoted to the detection and punishment of guilt." CHAPTER XXXIV. ROSE MAKES AN ENEMY. Leaving Ben and his new guardian on their passage across the Atlantic, we will precede them to New York, and inquire after the welfare of some of our other characters. The Beauforts seemed to have entered on a new and prosperous career. Rose continued to give lessons in music, and to receive liberal compensation. She was really an accomplished musician, and had the happy knack of making herself agreeable to her young pupils. Besides, she was backed by the influence of Miss Wilmot, and that helped her not a little. Her sister Adeline, too, gave lessons in art, and thus contributed to the family purse. My readers will not have forgotten the young man who rescued Rose from the disagreeable attentions of her elderly lover, Mr. Parkinson. More than once Rose had thought of Clinton Randall, and, though she scarcely admitted it to herself, cherished the hope that they would some day meet again. The young man's frank, chivalrous manners, and handsome face and figure, had impressed her most favorably, and she suffered herself to think of him more than she would have liked to admit. Had she known that Clinton Randall had been equally attracted by her, and had made strenuous efforts to find her ever since their first meeting, she would have been much gratified. Some weeks passed, however, before she saw him again. One afternoon, as she was walking through Madison Square on her way home from Mrs. Tilton's, where she had given her customary lessons, she met the young man in the walk. His face glowed with unmistakable joy as he hurried forward, with hand extended. "I am very glad to meet you again, Miss Beaufort," he said, eagerly. "Where have you been? Not out of the city?" "Oh, no!" answered Rose, successfully concealing her own pleasure at the meeting. "You can't expect a poor music-teacher to break away from her work at this season?" "But I did not know you were a music-teacher." "No, I suppose not," answered Rose, smiling. "Do you give lessons on the piano?" "Yes, it is my only instrument." "I have for a long time thought of taking lessons on the piano," said Randall, who had never thought of it before, "if I could only find a teacher who would not be too strict. Do you--take gentlemen?" "I am afraid I could not venture upon a pupil of your age, Mr. Randall," said Rose, amused. "Suppose you proved refractory?" "But I never would." "I am afraid my time is fully occupied. I will promise, however, to take you, if I agree to take any gentlemen." "Thank you. I shall not forget your promise." Clinton Randall, though he had been walking in a different direction, turned and accompanied Rose, both chatting easily and familiarly. It never occurred to Rose that she might meet any one who would comment upon her and her escort. But at the corner of Eighteenth street and Broadway she met a tall young lady, who made her the slightest possible nod, while she fixed eyes of scorn and displeasure upon the two. Clinton Randall raised his hat, and they parted. "You know Miss Jayne, then, Miss Beaufort," said Randall. "Yes, slightly, and you?" "I have met her in society." "She is a niece of Mrs. Tilton, to whose daughters I am giving music-lessons." "Indeed! I know Mrs. Tilton--I am to attend her party next week. Shall you be there?" "I believe so--not as a guest, however. She has invited me to play on the piano for the entertainment of the guests. You will probably dance to my music." "I would rather dance with you to the music of another player, Miss Beaufort." "You forget, Mr. Randall, that I am a poor music-teacher." "I don't think of it at all. It makes no difference in your claims to consideration." "The world does not agree with you, Mr. Randall." "Then it ought. By the way, Miss Beaufort, has your elderly admirer renewed his proposals?" "Mr. Parkinson? No, I have not met him since." "You are sure you won't relent, and make him a happy man?" "I don't think it at all likely," said Rose, laughing. Meanwhile Rose had made an enemy without being aware of it. Miss Arethusa Jayne had long looked upon Clinton Randall with eyes of partiality, not alone on account of his good looks, but because he was wealthy, socially distinguished, and in all respects a desirable _parti_. In her vanity she had thought that he was not indifferent to her attractions. When, therefore, she saw him walking with her aunt's music-teacher, she was not only angry but jealous. She reluctantly admitted that Rose was pretty, though she considered herself still more so. After this meeting she changed her plans, and went straight to her aunt. "Aunt," she said, "whom do you think I met on Broadway just now?" "I am sure I can't tell, Arethusa. I suppose all the world and his wife are out this fine day." "Your music-teacher, Miss Beaufort, and Clinton Randall." "You don't say so!" ejaculated Mrs. Tilton. "How should she know him?" "I have no idea they were ever introduced," said Arethusa, sneering. "Probably she isn't particular how she makes acquaintance with gentlemen. I always thought her forward." "I can't say I ever did, Arethusa." "Oh, she covers it up with you; but I ask you, Aunt Lucy, how could she otherwise get acquainted with a gentleman of Mr. Randall's position?" "I don't know. Was she actually walking with him?" "Certainly, and laughing and talking in a boisterous, unladylike way." Of course this was untrue, but a jealous woman is not likely to consider her words. "I thought you ought
