You have been selling out this department for months-- selling out these guys-- to anybody willing to pay the price. All right? And Meka found out about it. My friend found out about it, so you shot him. You shot him, and you threw him in a fire pit. Then you killed Ochoa, and you planted the gun on him so it'd look like he killed Meka. And what you did-- look at me-- what you did was impressive because you thought you cleaned everything up, but you made one mistake, because you're stupid. That's him. You killed my friend. Sit down.

You made it up. The dry erase does not lie, partner. We are trailing Hodges and lang by one bust. I mean, if we lose to those dudes, I'll blow my brains out. How does second place taste? First place tastes sweet, like bacon. We got to bust that little graffiti punk. I'm thinking a stakeout all nightlong. I'll order some pizza, blue oyster cult on the cassette deck. What do you say? You know, while that sounds enticing, you're gonna have to count me out, all right? Liz and I are gonna be gone for the weekend. That's... This weekend? Yes, this weekend.

We were just getting some info from him about drug dealers, and he gave us a few tips. One of them just happened to be about this bed and breakfast. I was talking about work, wasn't I? Uh-huh. And I promised you I wouldn't talk about work. I believe I even have it in writing. Yeah, okay. No work talk, 'cause that's why we broke up the first time. Listen, I promise you. This weekend, it's just gonna be about us. Okay? You're gonna love it. I called ahead, and I made some arrangements with the owner. Your couple's massage is tomorrow afternoon. Our therapist specializes in Swedish, if that's okay. Sounds amazing. Thank you, Mr. long. Oh, please. Call me Carson. Follow me upstairs. Now, if you don't like the Jasmine body soap that's in your room, I also have honeydew and juniper. Well, thank you. This place is gorgeous. It's great. I like doing things the right way. It's my little shangri-la. I recently got out of a very, very difficult marriage, so I needed a place to find my center, be around happy young couples like yourselves. So, uh, what line of work are you two in? Oh, well, I'm an assistant district attorney, and Jack here is a Detective with the Dallas p.D. Uh, uh, detec-- police Detective? Really? What kind of crimes do you investigate? Oh, property crimes, mostly. So, uh, burglaries, larceny, car theft -- that sort of thing? Yeah, pretty much. My partner and I can get tangled up in... Well, it -- it gets interesting. Well, is it the people, you find, or the crimes themselves? You know, I kind of promised that I wouldn't talk about work this weekend. Oh, of course. Sorry. Uh, you're just the first police-Detective guest I've had. Well, here we are. Thank you. Enjoy. We will. What are you laughing at? Nothin'. Oh, come on. What's funny? Well, it's work-related, so I can't tell you. Okay, well, let's just make one exception. Come on. I want to hear it. Okay. Uh Dan has this rule. It's called "the rule of three." Now, if a guy asks a cop three questions in a row, it means he's a criminal. Jack, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

Give me the detonator! Here she comes. Okay, move, move, move. Time to get paid. Detective stark? Yeah. Hey. Oh, am I interrupting? No, you are not. Well, w-what are you doing? I'm working on my tagging signature. See, in order to catch a tagger, you got to think like a tagger. So what I do is I work on a signature, and then I drop my signature on top of their, uh, their taggy. In the world of tagging, that's an insult. So they return to the scene of the crime to put their taggy on top of my taggy on top of their taggy, and you bust them. Wow! Back in '84, my old partner, Frank, and me, we accidentally triggered a gang war doing this, but we caught our tagger. Maybe you can avoid a gang war this time, because I might have a lead. What do you got? I analyzed the tagger's paint. It's an Icelandic blue, and only five stores in Dallas carry it. I called around. Four of them have been robbed! Here. Here's the fifth store. Bless you, child. Looks like it's a stakeout for me tonight at the fifth store. Sounds like a perfect evening. Mm-hmm. Do you hear that? No. Yeah, exactly. Crickets. There's no walkie-talkies, no police scanners, no angry, drunken perp yelling at you from the jail cell. Jack Bailey, I do believe you're enjoying your time off. I believe I am. Mm! Almost forgot.

I tried to lick your face, but it was only because you had chocolate on it. Close enough. Knock, knock. Oh, hey. I brought you a little blanket. It's chilly out here. Thank you. How do spinach and feta omelets sound for breakfast tomorrow morning? That sounds like heaven. Carson, you're spoiling us. I'm not gonna want to go home. Oh. If you enjoy your stay, I just -- I hope you tell your friends. Yeah, speaking of which -- how do you know Julius Grant? Uh, pardon me? Julius Grant. He recommended this place to me. Well, when I was starting the place, I got my in-room tvs and mini fridges from Julius. Gosh, that seems like a long time ago. How do you know Julius? You okay? Yeah. That's so funny that you know Julius. That's, uh -- that's really funny. Okay. Well, thank you, Carson. We'll see you -- okay, then, I-I'll be inside. That guy is shady. You cannot tell me that that was not shady. Jack, just because he knows Julius does not make him a criminal. Julius used to be a thief. It's not that he just knows Julius. Did you see the way he was acting? Okay, okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just being a paranoid cop. I apologize. Why don't I get us some more wine? This is Samantha. Sam. Jack. Listen, I need a favor. Jack? Hi. Anything. This may be stupid, but I need you to run a background check on a Carson long. He's the owner and manager of the sweetbriar bed and breakfast where Liz and I are staying. "Carson long" isn't coming up in the system. It may be an alias, all right? Keep looking. Now, I also want you to get in touch with Julius Grant, okay? He's on our confidential-informant roster. I need you to ask him what he knows about this guy. Oh, and, Sam... On the downlow, okay? I love the downlow. Bye. What's on the downlow? Oh! Uh, how did the stakeout of the tagger go? Not well. What's on the downlow? I'm not sure I'm at liberty to say. Listen up, darling. I live on the downlow. I was born on the downlow. You write "downlow" on an envelope, you lick a stamp, stick it on that puppy, drop it in the mailbox, it comes to me. What's on the downlow? Today is your birthday? OK, OK, I got something for you a little something for the birthday girl. Julius. I give you that, you got to give me your number. Loverboy, I'd like to get my groove back. I just want you to write your number down... Denzel. Could you please...? Okay, thank you, thank you. Look, I'm sorry, all right, to keep y'all waiting, but a job like this is all about customer service. What do you remember about this bb dude? Okay, the, uh, only thing I really remember is dude bought -- he bought some mini fridges, he bought some tvs, stuff like -- this is back in my, uh, my pawnshop days, my "black-market distribution" days, before I saw the error in my ways, started pouring drinks for a living -- you know what I mean? Okay. Listen, Dan, that's the only thing I remember. Okay? I'm sorry. Nothing? Oh, come on, j-bone. Jacko's radar was beeping all over this dude. Wait a second, like, every time y'all beep, I have to, like, figure out where the damn noise is coming from? You see how they do me? Yeah, that's what a good snitch does. So if you don't know anything about this dude, then you make some calls on the streets, see if they know anything about Carson long. You say "Carson long"? Yeah, Carson long. That's weird. That dude told me that his name was, uh -- what did he say it was? -- Carson pulaski. Pulaski? Yeah. Pulaski? Mm-hmm. Come on, now. That's not a name you make up. That's a name you're born with. Come to think of it, he paid everything with these real, like, crisp $100 bills. Oh. Jacko's radar was not wrong. Thank you, my brother. You got it. Okay, Sam, here's what I need you to do. Hitch a ride back to h.Q. Do the typity-typity, get all the info you can on our Polish friend. Then call me on my cellular testicle shrinker if you learn something. Okay. Where you going? Maybe we shouldn't have had that second bottle of wine. I need some water. Dan: Room service. Room service? We just ate. Hey, partner. No! Wow, nice. What the hell are you doing here? ! I heard you found a bad guy. I did? Liz: Jack, who is it? Uh... it's room service. I did? We found out the real name of the bb owner, and it's not Carson long. Don't worry. Sam told me we're keeping it on the downlow. Yeah, the downlow meant "don't tell you." Well, then, that's a miscommunication. Liz: I'm ready! Oh, geez. Uh... Seriously? Get in, get in, get in. Go on! And do not make so much as a noise, or I swear, I will shoot you through this armoire. And don't smell Liz's clothes. Who was it? Uh, no-- nobody. What do you think? You look amazing. Then what are you doing all the way over there? I'm on my way. Um... Yeah. Mm, where were we? Um... Uh.. Oh, yeah. I remember. Yeah, I remember now. Um... Hey, uh... Why don't we go on a little walk of the, uh -- the grounds of sweetbriar? Hmm? Jack, do you not want this? No, no, no, no, no, no. I do, I do.

Get out, get out. She's asleep. She's asleep? Hold it. I got to get you some coffee. Man, you can't pass up this kind of sexatunity. Look at that outfit. No, no, don't look at the outfit, all right? Get out of here. Well, where am I supposed to sleep? Your car. Your car, Dallas - - I don't care. Can I have a pillow? Stop looking! Dan, get out! Go for stark. Morning, Detective! It's Sam. Mm, ohh. Is it morning, already? I was having this righteous dream. I was busting this ring of lady cat burglars, and this gorgeous redhead tied me up. Whoo! Okay. So, I learned some more about Carson pulaski, our bed-and-breakfast owner. Earlier this year, he was investigated by the feds for money laundering, but charges were never filed. Detective, are you awake? Yeah, I'm awake, darlin'. Crime is my coffee. Why didn't the feds ever bring charges? Apparently he didn't meet the federal evidentiary requirements. I'll take one look in that punk's eyes, get all the evidence I need. One more thing. According to court records, he left his wife, and she has been trying to track him down to sign divorce papers. Ohh, come on, now. What kind of a coward hides from a woman? Seriously, I think it's disgusting. I got to go, Detective stark. I'm getting another call. Samantha Evans? Uh-huh. Hi, um, this is marion pulaski. I got a call from my lawyer saying that you might know where my husband, Carson, is? Hi! Yes, I do. Um, he's running the sweetbriar bed and breakfast near Palmer, about 30 miles outside Dallas. He's still in Texas? Mm-hmm. Wow. I can't tell you how glad I am to hear that. I've been looking for Carson for months now. Well, I know how you feel. My college boyfriend left me after graduation -- I think to join a cult, but I never knew for sure. So, uh, good luck with that. Thank you. Bye. You are not gonna believe who I just found. Be here in half an hour. Oh, good morning. Can I help you? Yeah, I think you can. Well, great. You interested in booking a room? We have a few vacancies. Detective Dan stark, Dallas p.D. Second cop this week. Uh, what's going on, Detective? I don't know... Mr. pulaski. Pu-what-ski?

Great job, Tyler. Really? Aw, 'cause I thought I was taking too long to unload the money. I still wish I could have pressed that detonator button. That would have been so cool. Hey, maybe next time, yeah? There isn't gonna be a next time. This is my last shot, Tyler. Don't move. What's going on? Hey, hey, don't move. You're a sweet kid. I don't want to hurt you. You're not gonna kill me, are you? What'd I just say? Hey, lie down on the ground, okay? Facedown. I don't want to hurt you. Count to 100. If you don't finish, then... Yeah, I'm gonna shoot you in the head. Okay? Got that? Yeah. Am I counting backwards from 100, or am I starting from 1 and then going to 100? Either one. Just say all the numbers. 100, 99, 98, 97, 98 -- oh, no. Now I'm going back up again. Detective, this has all been a big misunderstanding. I-I have the paperwork right over here. Son of a bitch! Come on, now! How's that head feeling? Awful. You son of a bitch! Dan? ! High-five me, partner! You gonna leave me hangin'? All right. Whoo-hoo! How you doin', Liz? It ain't all about you then. I am very sorry that I .. you're very sorry, are you? ! Sit down! Could I explain? No! I'd like to explain. Yah! Sit! Okay. Thanks. Dan, what the hell is going on? ! Code 512.

Yeah, but what were you chasing him for? ! He's a dirty, filthy money-launderer! Sam ran a computer thingy on him. Turns out the dude's being investigated by the feds. They got a warrant out on him. Wait. This is about money laundering? Yes. What else would it be about? Nothing. Obviously. Guys, I am telling you -- this is a big misunderstanding. You see, I bought this place with cash. I won big at the track. I didn't know about all the paperwork that I had to do. There were no charges ever filed. I don't believe this track business. I mean, for a place like this? No, I think this place is a front for drugs, human slaves... Cambodian girls and whatnot. I swear, it's not a front. It's just my bed and breakfast. Well, if you have nothing to hide, why'd you run? Huh? Why'd you hit my partner and then take off? All right, you want to know the truth? I've been hiding from my wife. All right? We had a very challenging marriage. If I get arrested, then I will be in the system, and she will find me. If you met this woman, you would understand. She has she has extreme rage issues. Maybe you better man up. A rage issue can really spice up a relationship. Maybe I'll lend you my cuffs when you get out of jail. Speaking of a woman with rage issues. Liz? Liz! Look, Liz. I can explain. Really, Jack? You can explain why Dan just catapulted across our breakfast table? Explain that to me. I'm all ears. Okay. Last night when I went to go get more wine, I called the station to do a background check on Carson -- just in case. Now, Dan wasn't even supposed to know about it, but then he -- he shows up last night. Wait. Did you just say Dan was here last night? When? When? When did this happen, Jack? When -- when we -- we came back from dinner. Was Dan the room service? Did Dan stark see me in my bedroom attire? No. Jack? Maybe. Oh, my God! Yeah, he did. But then I kicked him out right afterwards. Oh, Jack, this is bad. Jack, I really wanted this to be different, and it's not. But I feel stupid for trusting you. Hey, but... Carson is a criminal. I mean, doesn't that make it less bad? Yeah, Jack. It gives you tons of points as a cop, not so many as a boyfriend. So that's it? You're -- you're leaving? Come on, plea-- please, don't go. Jack, we've been through this before, and I already know how it ends. It ends with me in second place. To me that just feels a whole lot like losing. Liz. Hi, it's Liz traynor. Please leave a message. Appreciate your cooperation. We caught someone stealing little shampoos out of their room. Yeah. It's a crime. You have a good day, now. Bye, there, Mr. and Mrs. McGee!

Don't you think there's, uh, some way that we can work this out here? Work it out? Sir, are you attempting to bribe me? No, I don't think you understand what my wife is like. Marion is -- she's a very volatile woman. Is there another kind of woman? You're not getting it, man. If she finds me here, I'm dead. I'm a dead man.

I'm sorry that I teamed up my rat-bastard husband and my idiot little brother, who can't even drive across town without screwing it up! Well, do you think Carson still has the money and...? That's what we're gonna find out. What are you doing? Hey, I just want to say -- and you're probably not gonna want to hear this -- but... I like Carson. He's a great brother-in-law. I-I really miss him. So maybe you two could, like, talk things through. I'm not taking anything through with that son of a bitch. All right, so, what's the plan? First... yeah. We're gonna find Carson. Then we're gonna find out where the money is. Then we're gonna kill anyone who comes between us and the money. That's the plan, baby. Yes. That's the plan!

I should have known better than to take you to a bed and breakfast that was suggested to me by my c.I. That was a stupid thing to do, but more importantly, I am sorry.

Hell, if you needed me to, I wouldn't even have a job. I'd be unemployed and let you support both of us if that's what made you happy -- sit around the house and gain a bunch of weight, all for you.

How you could be naked lying next to her naked, but here you are tied up with me? Thanks, Dan. It's just an observation. I thought you weren't gonna kill the cops. No, I'm not gonna kill the cops. They're just gonna die in a tragic hotel fire is all. Come on. How deep did you bury the money? Not much deeper. Why did you leave me? Huh? Was it -- was it my weight? Because I know there was a time when I was a little heavy, you know, after I did that six months in county. Oh, honey. It wasn't that. I... I like a couple extra pounds. You shut up! Just dig, dig! Oh, if I could just pop my shoulder... Like I used -- are you okay? No. No. It seems to have stiffened up over the years. Well, when was the last time you tried that? Ohh...

We take that money, we change our names, we go to Arizona, we get another bed and breakfast -- okay? - - Together. What do you think? Ty's in. Honey? Here we go! Ohh! Ohh! I did it! My shoulder popped! I can still do it! What is that, jacko? What is that song? Ha! It's massage music, Dan. It's Terri-- it's terrible, Jack. Help! Somebody, help! It's like alien torture music from the future. Make it stop, jacko! Make it stop! Can we focus, please, Dan? ! I'm scared! Come on, get up! Get up, Dan! All right, if we don't die from the smoke inhalation, we're gonna burn to a crisp! No, you're right! You're right, partner! We got to we got to get out! Say goodbye, sweetheart. Wait, wait, wait, wait, honey, honey. I just - - I just want to say... This bed and breakfast... I worked so hard. I picked out all the bedspreads... And the linens. It was a dream of mine from the very beginning. Come on! Help! Somebody, help! Hello? Anybody here? ! Fire! Fire! Farewell... Sweet sweetbriar. Okay, I'm at peace. All right, new plan. I was gonna kill you and just bury you in this hole you just dug, but we're gonna need some money. I think I want to take you with us. We're gonna rob a check-cashing store, and you are gonna kill the guard this time, and then I'm gonna kill you nice and slow. Tyler, come on. Get him out! I was totally on board with Arizona. Okay, now, come here. Come here. Come here. Give me your hand, all right? Let's try to untie each other, okay? Oh, Jack! Yeah, what? We may not make it out of this one. We're gonna get out of here, Dan. We may not! We're gonna get out of here! Just tell me, jacko, what did you do with Liz in the sack this weekend? Are you serious? Oh, Jack. You didn't do anything, did you? Jacko, you learned nothing from me! Hey, can we focus less on what didn't happen and more about what is going to happen if we don't get out of here? ! Jack? ! Liz! Liz! Liz! Liz! We're in here! Jack? Jack: We're in here! I can hear you! Hold on! I can't get in! Find something and break the lock, okay? ! We're tied up! Hang on, hang on, hang on! It's dangerous! Oh, my God, I swear, I leave you two alone for two minutes! Oh! It's so nice to see you! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Hang on. Dan: Oh, darlin'. It's moments like this where I understand why Jack loves you so much even though you never put out. Oh, damn it! They're getting away! They're getting away! Are you okay? Yeah. I think I burned my arm pretty bad. That was really brave -- reckless, but brave. Well, you can't always be the hero, Jack Bailey. I'm really glad you came back. I got your message. Jacko! Come on! We got to catch these punks! No, no! I'm not leaving Liz! Jack, go. It's fine. I'm fine. Really. No. I am not leaving you. Jack, now is the time to put work before our relationship. Now go bust me some punks, baby. Go, go, go! Pull up to the left! Shoot 'em! I get the she-devil! Hey, baby! Hey, now, you little vixen! Come to papa! Freeze! Wow, someone actually listened for once. Hands up! Why, you little firecracker! Ugh! You know, uh, under different circumstances, you and me, we could have done a lot of damage together back at that bed and breakfast. But for now... Just gonna cuff you. You have the right to remain silent... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, I'm not gonna be locked up with my sister, will I? Since there are no co-ed prisons, no, you won't. Okay. I'm sorry for interrupting. I... No, it's okay. Okay. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law -- sit down. Ah, ah! Carson! Stop right there! That's right, Carson! Just run away! That's what you always do! Hey, for what it's worth, I hope you enjoyed your stay at sweetbriar! Yeah, not really! Thanks a lot, guys. Hey, bad news, partner. Looks like we lost the "monthly bust count." How? After all this? Turns out the akard street armored-car heist was Hodges and lang's. That was their case. They drove all the way out just to rub it in. So we only get credit for attempted murder. Well, shouldn't we be breaking even? No. They got that graffiti punk, too. Why are you laughing? I guess the tagger bust didn't go so well. Hey, Hodges, I finally like one of your ties! But tomorrow is a new month. Clean slate. Clean slate sounds awesome. Here you go. I want you and Lizzie to take my baby wherever you want to take her. I'm gonna hitch a ride back to Dallas, make sure that little vixen doesn't cause any damage on the way back. How would you like to spend the rest of our weekend together? Relaxing. Then let's get back to Dallas. Trust me. I'm the Doctor. Geronimo! The Doctor will see you now! Now I've done it. no! # Anybody who thinks I can't do it any more # Better step right back and take that... # isn't it? He's the Doctor! # Take that... # Who da man? I'm never saying that again. Fine! # Anybody who thinks I can't do it any more # Better step right back and take that # I've got the formula I've got the formula # Take that! I'll reign on all of yer... # Talk to me! panicking at once. Do you know what they need? Me. that... # Hello. Am I late? Everything is going to be fine. Run. # Anybody who thinks I can't do it any more # Better step right back and take that that... # Hello. I'm the Doctor. the new Doctor begins his journey. everyone. we're about to start. this one. Just so you feel relaxed. let's kill them with this one. We'll go round the table and say our names just because I never tire of saying I'm Steven Moffat and I'm the executive producer and head writer of Doctor Who. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE I play the Doctor. I'm playing Amy. I'm playing Amelia. Amelia's garden. creepy. then Amelia's house and like the garden it's old and a bit run down. but a bit spooky. dolls and pencils... It's Easter now so I hope I didn't wake you. it is an emergency. Amelia is the first human being that he sees in his new regenerated form which I think alien life form. He meets her and she's in her garden in her nightie with a torch. the Doctor. his eyes are wild and dancing. He's looking right at Amelia. Can I have an apple? apples... maybe I'm having a craving. That's new. I've never had cravings before. The new Doctor is essentially the same man he has been for all the previous 906 years of his life. There is no such thing as the 11th Doctor. There's one Doctor with 11 faces. He is the same man. Argh! mister? I'm fine. It's OK. This is all perfectly nor... Who are you? I don't know yet. I'm still cooking. you feel very different. But is the continuing story of the same man with a different face. if I give it a good project that way. Um... I mean I'll... I won't.... What I'll do is probably do a lean forward as well. Yeah. Are we going to get that? It's like being born again. new smell. you know? action. why does your box say "police"? Can I go from the top? Keep purchase on that bad boy. please. B camera. action. why does your box say "police"? please. There's a lack of kind of cynicism that happens when we're adults and it's like children see things and accept them and try them and spit them out. That's disgusting. What is that? An apple. I hate apples. You said you loved them. I'll have yoghurt. Yoghurt's my favourite. I hate yoghurt. It's just stuff with bits in. new rules. It's like eating after cleaning your teeth everything tastes WR-O-O-O-NG! kind of physically it's all sporadic and weird and he's hitting himself and not really knowing how to react to this new body but also his personality is regenerating as well. What's wrong with you? Wrong with me? fry something. cut there. because he'd never seen the show was that he was tonally perfect from the off. He got what sort of part it is. the nuttiness of it. Just instantly. It was just so obvious. It was such an obvious choice. I'd found out I'd got the role. I'd come out of an audition and it was for a pilot sitcom and No. have I got it? Yes. no pacing up and down this cobbled street in Aldgate. actually. And I was just... ecstatic. so I told them. They couldn't quite believe it. My Mum and Dad didn't sleep for at least a day. this is Dad. This is Confidential. Mother's wearing her semi Patrick Charleston coat. right anyway. because it was early in the morning and I was just eating a bowl of cornflakes. The phone went and I saw that it was Matt. just call me the Doctor. Why? call me the Doctor. I shouted Lynne. really. we couldn't tell a soul and that was the most difficult bit for Lynne and I because we couldn't tell anybody and there were a couple of nights where we just sat up at night and talked about it because we couldn't talk about it to anybody else. It's a kind of mad thing to happen to you. The show has such momentum and such brilliance and grace and all the good things that it has that it does cover a great deal of interest from the media. as best you can. It was odd. I think it's odd for your family and stuff because it becomes part of their life as well. I was standing at a bar in a local pub one evening and "You're Doctor Who's granddad? My autograph? he wants the autograph. from Doctor Who's granddad and he was dead happy. I'm famous in the village through Matt now. I sort of carried it around with me like a little piece of gold in my pocket or whatever it was. I remember walking down the road. I walked to Camden and listened to Frank Sinatra and felt pretty much on top of the world. yeah. I walked past a window and looked in a thing I'm the Doctor. # I've got you # Under my skin # I've got you # Deep in the heart of me # So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me # I've got you # Under my skin. # "How lucky we are because what he is bringing to the role is absolute dedication brilliant acting. I think Matt's amazing. I think he's brilliant actor. we're really proud. # Under my skin... # brilliant actor. We're incredibly lucky. I've never experienced anything like that where you take over the reins of something as did Chris. I think they were both brilliant Doctors. you can only be ever true to your own do you know what I mean? And try and make it work for you in your way. let's make it mine. being the new Doctor means getting your hands on a brand new TARDIS. what have you got for me this time? Look at you. It's still bigger on the inside but designer Ed Thomas has a few surprises in store for the new Doctor. This is where we've got to as it stands. you've got to go for it. You've got to chance everything and he's changed everything. everything. it's time for a new set. It's time to surprise people again. The fact is we've got more space now than when the original TARDIS set was built. let's make it even bigger on the inside. The first thing I saw was the scale. It's much bigger than the old TARDIS. The depth of it! I love the levels. a black liquid floor or a black Perspex floor so we get reflections. What we've never been able to achieve on this TARDIS is we've never been able to go underneath. I love the idea of going underneath. strange ways. that was the idea. An even bigger on the inside TARDIS and let's just go mad with it. The biggest change of this TARDIS is we've really pimped it up. the man who designs the TARDIS. We're going to have a look round and he's going to show me how to fly it and what bit's what. So! Enter! This is the new TARDIS. This is where I do my correspondence. Right. We've got all sorts of sections. each one has a different purpose. which is blown glass. We searched high and low to find somebody that could blow us the glass to the scale they did and these chaps in Bristol pulled it off for us. I know. It's almost twice as big. It's enormous. It varies off in all directions. am I right in saying if you walk up there you end up... over there? You do. It's very clever. It's all done with mirrors. look. which are just incredible. There's so much detail. Oh! A new one. Lovely. I've prepared a manual for you here. mechanical... This will tell you where everything you need is. What do these do? What does it say? Quantum form foam manipulators. Absolutely! It's a quantum foam manipulator. How could I not know that? you'll need to revise this and learn this. Absolutely! This is your version of the iPod. Ha! My tune list. You put your music in there and on your go. aren't they? all the lights and wires. It feels like it does have life. Yes. That's what's amazing about it. That's where we've achieved something special on this one. We have an awful lot of moving parts in here. it really is full of life and this is the Gallifreyan text. The carvings on here are all the Gallifreyan text is the Doctor's language. back in time. of course. It's all there for you. I'm hitting a lot of double... which is why you're in the trouble you're in. THEY LAUGH maybe? let's do that. And that is actually lit by this liquid? Yeah. Can I touch it? You can. And it's not just water? It's water with a bit of food colouring in it to make it look like oil. What's this then? That's a protective sheath over the heart of the TARDIS. Yeah... So underneath there is what literally drives it. It kind of feels like the most brilliant den in the world. Yeah. I hope you like it. I hope you have many hundreds of years time travelling in it. It is pretty much the most brilliant thing to come into every day. It's like a giant playground. it's thrilling. I feel very privileged to have such a TARDIS. the TARDIS undergoes a regeneration the old one has one last bumpy ride. Maybe a bit more coming out of the base areas. The TARDIS has just come hurtling through space. It's gone careering through this shed and buried itself straight into the ground. give it a bit more impact. just to give it a bit more of a... like it's actually properly hit the ground and dress it nicely for that shot. So there's no way at all this could be just a little bit more like that? is if we wedge the back end up. We can do that. We can put it on a jaunty angle. Fancy that? Yeah. Let's do that. Yeah. So it looks like it's made an impact. love. which I love and it looks brilliant. directing the smoke. it's all looking good. thank god. I'll come to... who is a superstar. She's just a diamond. You couldn't ask for better. She's lovely. She takes direction. She listens and she's just like she's been doing it for years. and action! I've got to get back in there. it's going to burn! But... But... It's just a box. How can a box have engines? It's not a box. It's a time machine. What? Caitlin's a little star. She's lovely. yeah. And brilliant and very... you know. or anything. If Caitlin moves a tiny bit to her left. don't you? darling. Are you really clever at school? No. No. you're really clever in life. that's cooler. I think she's wonderful. I'm the Doctor. Geronimo! SPLASHING grinding engines heave into life and the TARDIS fades from view. Amelia's staring and then she's racing back into the house. She comes tearing into her bedroom and grabs a tiny suitcase from under her bed a toothbrush. you run to me and get...? Clothes. Then you put them in and you grab your...? Teddy. Toothbrush. put that in and you come and get...? Teddy. Put him in and you run out and get...? shawl. shawl. shawl. I bet you get it wrong. THEY LAUGH Stand by. wearing a coat and hat over her night clothes. sits on it and waits. I met my cousin for the first time at the read through of episode one. I'm related to Karen Gillan. She's my cousin. She grew up in Ireland and I left Inverness quite young. we just never met. We'd always just missed each other and the first time I met her was at the read through. there's family resemblance and there's just a connection there because we are of the same blood. Action! You're Amelia. You're late. you're the little girl. I'm Amelia and you're late. promised you all the time in space and said he'd be back in five minutes and you spend the rest of your life wondering if that was real or if that's ever going to turn up. he's going to get a much harder time because she's the girl who waited and he's the man that didn't show up. What happened? 12 years. You hit me with a cricket bat. 12 years. A cricket bat. 12 years and four psychiatrists. Four? young lady. Amy is a sassy lady. She's really got a mind of her own. She doesn't tend to take the Doctor's word as gospel. She just has her own opinions on things and doesn't listen to everything he says and she questions him and challenges him all the time. That's what's lovely about this relationship. It's quite tempestuous because Amy's very strong willed and is not afraid to give the Doctor a clap across the face if he needs it. She's got this inner confidence in her and she can really handle herself in situations. She's incredibly witty. She's fun. Her and the Doctor have a great time together. sit still. what are you doing? Amy? Why did you say six months? Why did you say five minutes? Are you not going to turn your back? Nope. That is not possible. That was two years ago. What? You're a policewoman? I'm a kiss-o-gram! You're Amelia. You're late. you're the little girl. I'm Amelia and you're late. Are you from another planet? Come with me. Where? Wherever you like. Why me? Why not? THEY LAUGH the crew have the mighty task of turning the home of Amy Pond. We've done a lot of London in Doctor Who. The truth is it became almost one of the cliches of the series because we did it so often. You saw it so much. You got bored of it. So we thought what other iconic English thing can you do? A beautiful little village - why not? action! What is this place? Where am I? Leadworth. Where's the rest of it? This is it. Is there an airport? No. Nuclear power station? No. half an hour by car. We don't have half an hour. Do we have a car? that is. 20 minutes to save the world and I've got a Post Office. And it's shut. What is that? It's a duck pond. Why aren't there any ducks? I don't know. There's never any ducks. Then how do you know it's a duck pond? As you can see it's quite a big village. We've had to dress the whole lot. street signs... Post Office headlines and details there. You come right the way through to the book store. Various books outside there relevant to Leadworth. All the postcards on the stands. All perfect for Leadworth. all the leadwork on the windows. all of that stuff to do with them. that's part of what's gone on so far. All the residents know so there's letter drops. why we're here. what we're doing. It's all very well organised and 99% of the time it all goes really well. Are you ready? Catch. Oh! Oh! I'll try and get the keys. or not? just to keep it... I think it is. Struggle a bit and know that... "You know who I am... I can be a bit mad at the top. Who are you?" "But you know who I am. it's the end of the world in 20 minutes. please. Camera set... action! I can do it. run to your loved ones and say goodbye or stay and help me. I'm sorry. no! What are you doing? there's a lot of stuff that happens that makes it quite tricky to stage and a tie has to get trapped into the door. what are you doing? No. Still running. Reset! the most significant story beat there is the fact that they stop and have this moment together. Catch! I'm the Doctor. everything you've ever known is over. I don't believe you. 20 minutes. Just believe me for 20 minutes. Look at it. It's a kind of nod back to the moment they had together when she was a kid. Look at it. Fresh as the day you gave it to me and you know it's the same one. I don't think anyone will really notice but we cranked the camera up slightly so we've made it slightly slow motion when they have this little moment together. So it just slightly goes a bit magical. Amy... believe for 20 minutes. I think the moment with the apple is the moment where she actually has to make the choice whether she goes with it or not. she's spent all those years hardening her heart against the idea of an imaginary friend. because she's sceptical. She doesn't... She's learned to be tough on things like that. I bet she was mean about Santa Claus. I bet she was mean about the Tooth Fairy. you don't expect your imaginary friend to turn up and be exactly what he claimed to be all those years ago. you've had 12 years of growing up to be a slightly different person than you were going to be because this person let you down and they're standing there even though everything they're saying is completely bonkers. That's the moment where she has to decide that she's not grown up in a way. That she can still be a child. She's still allowed to believe in her childhood hero. What do we do? Stop that nurse. The sun's going down and you're photographing a man and a dog. Why? Amy... Hi. well... I think the relationship between Amy and Rory is quite complicated. He's completely in love with her. er... She likes running off and going on adventures and he's determined to... I think he's a romantic at heart and he's determined to get her but has no idea how to do it and gets very nervous when she's around. I think she really does love him but I think there are a lot of things that she needs to do in her life before she can admit how much she loves him. Rory is the guy who's grown up not being the doctor very young age. he's never turned up. He's the man who's tried to train to be a doctor but ended up being a nurse. He's the one who's not quite making it. He looks a tiny little bit like him but isn't the same. So he's grown up in the shadow of Amy's imaginary friend and Amy's imaginary friend turns out to be real. please. he came back. he was a game! Amy's always talked about this raggedy doctor that she's met and obviously she's had a few problems dealing with who he is and she's obviously talked about him a lot to Rory and he's become this fantasy figure that she thinks is amazing and Rory used to have to dress up as him because they've known each other for years and years. He's been in love with her for years and years. Rory's always wanted to be that doctor to her because he's this mythical character and then when the Doctor arrives he realises that why? because... he can't be there because he's in hospital. in a coma. Yeah. so it's just like going to work with your mate. you see. Disguises himself as anything. INAUDIBLE The quaint old village green is also home to a very new way of seeing the world through the eyes of the Doctor. It's a brilliant little sequence. We go into the Doctor's head and his eye and we see all the things that he's taking in and the camera sort of jolts round on this journey. It takes all these photographs of people. I've seen this. The Doctor notices everything. He notices that when everyone else is using their camera phones he notices one man on the village green who has his back to it because he's taking a picture of something completely different on his camera phone. That's Rory. That's what the Doctor's trying to remember. So even while the crisis is landing all around him he can notice one person not doing what he'd expect them to do. wait! I missed it. I saw it and I missed it. What did I see? I saw... What did I see? So there's a camera moving into his eye. I saw. Then we go into this sequence where he's remembering what's just happened. all yours. if you like. if I'm taking... I'd take 20 stills moving towards you. we take them into an editing programme. basically. It looks like live action. Kind of like a Why didn't you quit, Panos? I told you I'd defend Jacob. Or maybe I just wanted to see what you two would do next. Hear ye, hear ye. The third district court is now in session. The Honorable Henry Langdale presiding. All rise. Please be seated. Having reviewed all the evidence and testimony in the case of the People versus Jacob Ryan, juvenile, this court is now prepared to render judgment. Martha Taverner's death in the opinion of this court, was neither pre-meditated nor deliberately caused by the defendant. There was a heated argument, a mutually reckless struggle, but no criminal intent. Young man, I'm also mindful that you've expressed deep remorse. That you've made a full and free confession, and done so at your own insistence, without stipulating a plea bargain. Nevertheless, you have a clear culpability. By running away, by covering up your involvement in the death of Martha Taverner, you cast grave doubts on your own actions. And you short-circuited the very protections afforded you under the law. Jacob Ryan, please rise. I find you guilty... of involuntary manslaughter in the second degree. I sentence you to be taken from this place and confined at the Juvenile Correction Facility at Framingham for a period not to exceed five years. Still think it was worth it? My father had to serve almost a year for destroying evidence. Jacob was released on probation after two years. He has to go to counseling, though. So we have them back. But none of us is free. Each of us is marked forever now. Before and after. I look at Jacob now and I think about how different our lives might have been. All of us. And that's the saddest part of all. Hey, Jude, look. But lately, sometimes, I can feel myself starting to come alive again. And it's scary, kind of. I don't know if that's even allowed. Maybe you can't expect to keep happiness out of your life forever... any more than trouble. Your whole life can change in a second. And you never even know when it's coming. Hey, this way! They're gone. Whew, that was close. I've had it with this planet. Can't we do anything about the spaceship? No, we can't do anything. Nobody will sell us the parts for the spaceship, after all. Still, even if we are wanted men, these pictures are just a little too childish. Will you shut up already! You don't need to worry. We may be wanted men, but we're really not bad guys. Grandpa! Um, we were... There they are! This way! Whoops. Hold it! Gel, they came this way. I copy. Here they come! Don't be fooled because they're just kids! This is for yesterday! I'm going to get you good! They're here! Oh, good grief, Grandpa! Y- you're kidding me...! Yow-ow-ow...! Ee-yow! This is the worst! Our luck has run out! It's just one thing after another! That's fine and all, just hurry up and move it! Ah, Grandpa! Yow-ow-ow-ow! Super-yow! Are you that heavy? Are you sure you ain't become fat from skipping your training lately? I haven't gotten fat! I've grown! Y- you there! I - I know you! You're those violent wanted criminals, right? These are the three dangerous criminals that are on the loose. Anyone who sees these three, please contact the police at once. Now listen, we're... Pan-chan! We'll leave here right now. Yeah. Sorry about breaking your roof. We're sorry about that. Not again, Grandpa! I can't help it, you know. I'm hungry. J- just a moment, boys. You've got a lot of guts, breaking into Don Kia's palace like that, huh? I don't know how many years it's been since those scoundrels made this much fuss. Eh, it serves them right! And what do you know? Far from being dangerous criminals, you kids are nice and well-behaved, aren't you? Aren't we? I like you! If you're hungry, at least eat something before going! Come here, come here. Is that right? Your spaceship, huh? Indeed! It's awful! Regardless, there's no need for them to put us on the wanted list! On this planet, it is prohibited for you to have a spaceship. Why is that? It's to keep everyone confined to this planet. Everyone would flee from this planet if they had spaceships, after all. To Don Kia, the inhabitants of this planet are nothing more than tools to make money for him. Then, there are others like us, who have had their spaceships stolen, and are confined to this planet? We are among them, young lady. That's true of everyone who lives around here. This is a city of people who have had everything taken from them by Don Kia. But we're not discouraged! Besides, love is going to see to it that those scoundrels pay someday. That's awful! You should all just team up and get rid of him. Pan-chan...! We'd like to do just that, but Don Kia has this crackerjack bodyguard named Redjic. Damn, if he weren't around, I would go give him a pounding! Redjic...? Sorry about that, sonny. I'd only made enough for two from the get-go, so I don't have any more helpings to serve you. And you, a growing boy... M- ma'am, you don't mean to say that this was your...! Don't worry about it. We can skip a meal or so like it was nothing. Right, dear? Y- yeah. Pan-chan...! I've made a decision! A decision? If they want to capture us so badly, then we'll let them capture us! After all, we can't get the parts for our spaceship like this, anyhow! At this point, we're going to go to Don Kia directly and give him a piece of our minds! Come on, let's go! Off we go! Pan-chan! Goku-san! Boys! Don't worry, ma'am. After all, we're really strong! Oh, there they are! Well, hurry up! You want to catch us, right? So here we are, letting ourselves be caught. No matter how many times I count it, I can never count high enough! What is it? We've received information from Gel-sama that he and the others have captured the three on the wanted list. That was quicker than expected. Well, bring them in here. What? How did you get in here! ? Where is Gel! ? Those guys are downstairs, asleep. Don Kia! We've heard all about your evil ways! Y- you've heard more than you needed to, huh? So what are you going to do to me? I'm going to do this to you! Pan! Pan-chan! You can apologize, but I won't forgive this! Die! Stop. These aren't the sort of opponents you can defeat with such weapons. Redjic-sensei, in that case, please, let them have it! I've told you not to order me around. R- right, right... I... I fight for myself. Afraid... Afraid... Danger... Danger... Trunks! T- this guy can handle himself...! Leave this to me, Trunks. Goku-san... See to Pan. Right. I can feel your strength. I'm Goku! Son Goku! Who are you! ? I'm Redjic. And I don't hold back, even if my opponent is a child. There you are! My palace...! You're strong! I'm starting to get excited! Your ability must be greater than just this. Am I right, Saiya-jin? What? Okay, then. Let's begin the second round! Energy rising! Rising! What! ? Redjic! Ka... me... ha... me... HA! S - Sensei! If you trained, you'd be even stronger. I'm going to train and get stronger too, so when I do, let's go at it again, okay? You're a funny little kid. People say I'm funny, but I really ain't a kid. I'm not sure I understand, but then, the universe is a big place. I guess I'm still not completely developed-- Hey, are you okay? Hey, you! Sensei, please let those guys have it. I'll give you all this! You lowlife bastard! Son Goku, I'm going to win for sure next time. I ain't going to lose! I'm sorry! I was wrong! I'll do anything you say, just spare my life! You just said "anything," right? Y- yes! In that case, how about you abolish the rental system on this planet? B- but... Oh, you don't want to? Okay, Grandpa... All right! I will put an end to it! I will most humbly put an end to it! Mister! Ma'am! What is this? A present to everyone from Don Kia! Everyone's contracts are inside here, so you can burn them, or rip them up, or whatever you like! He also said he would return everyone's spaceships! Pretty nice, huh? Now you guys can go home to your own planets! Young lady...! We taught Don Kia a lesson, and got our parts, so for the time being, everything has been settled nicely. Now we can finally start searching for the Dragon Balls. Mm-hmm... But how do we do that? Our Dragon Radar got eaten. He ran away! You're not getting away! I told you, we're taking you apart and getting our Dragon Radar back! I'm breaking! If you don't want to get broken, then spit out the Dragon Radar! I'm breaking! I'm breaking! Pan-chan! Geez, Trunks, what did you do that for! ? I just feel sorry for him, you know? Feel sorry for him? It's just a machine, isn't it? Machines with artificial intelligence are the same as people. Even though their bodies are made of cold metal, on the inside, they still have warm hearts. Are you okay? Did that hurt? So what do you plan to use for a Dragon Radar? T- this is the Dragon Radar, isn't it? By any chance, can you take the functions of whatever mechanisms you assimilate, and make them your own? I knew it! T- then, you're saying that this thing has become the Dragon Radar? That's awesome! A reading? This is a Dragon Ball reading, isn't it? It is? Where? Where is it? Just a minute. Let's see... North. North. I get it. You're saying that from Imegga here, it's toward the north, right? Lucky! We've already located the first one! All right, once we finish up here, let's take off right away for the north! Having saved the people of Planet Imegga, Goku and the others head for space to the north. What sort of adventures await Goku and the others there? Who are you? What are you doing here? I've come to take what's mine. Go on. Scream all you want. We're all alone. Just you and I. No one's gonna save you now. I don't need saving. One more step and I'll have your head. I think I'd like that. - Baron Valicourt? - It was a mistake to see my face. You'd kill a woman? Actually, I was thinking of a fate worse than death. Never. Never! Never's a very long time. You're good, but not that good. - Oh, no? Submit. Never. You're an animal. I'm the king of beasts. And I'm the queen. Robert. Robert. Next time, I get to be on top. Anything you say, my dear. He is Duncan MacLeod, the Highlander. Born in 1592, in the Highlands of Scotland, and he is still alive. He is immortal. For 400 years, he's been a warrior, a lover, a wanderer, constantly facing other Immortals in combat to the death. The winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power. I am a Watcher, part of a secret society of men and women... who observe and record, but never interfere. We know the truth about Immortals. In the end, there can be only one. May it be Duncan MacLeod, the Highlander. Here we are Born to be kings We're the princes of the universe I am immortal I have inside me blood of kings I have no rival No man can be my equal Take me to the future of your world You know, you could do that up on deck. The view is better. Calms the spirit. You should try it sometime. What are you doing here? The place I rent's being sold. I hate moving. Then go move into a hotel. I wouldn't stay in any hotel that Adam Pierson could afford. Well, it's your problem if you're sitting here. Anything interesting? I'll let you know. Oh, Gina and Robert de Valicourt are getting married again. I thought theyweremarried. Well, they do it again every hundred years. Madly in love, huh? No, gluttons for punishment. I was married once, you know. Come to think of it, I was married 67-- no, 68 times. You had 68 wives? Yeah, never one of us, though. That'd be too much of a commitment for me to make. You have to love someone a hell of a lot to be with them for 300 years. Tough to imagine, huh? No, it's not. Not if you knew Gina. Fitzcairn and I were both madly in love with her. It's nothing to get upset about, Duncan. Nothing? How could you make a rendezvous with both of us? And on the same night. Especially withhim. When two dashing gentlemen invite me to two divine diversions, how could I refuse either of you? All I did was mix up the nights. Well, he'll have to wait. I was first. I'll have to wait? I think not, sir. We have a box for the opera tonight. The opera? Ach, a bunch of overdressed donkeys braying at the top of their lungs. We are dining at the Prussian ambassador's residence. Hours of High German passing for conversation, sauerkraut for food. Gives me gas just thinking about it. We've arrived. - This is the Baron de Valicourt's residence. - So they say. - A baron who lives like a king, huh? De Valicourt is the most notorious thief in Europe. And good at it by the looks of things. How good? Too good. That swine embezzled 20,000 louis from me. 20,000 louis? Why, that's-- That's a bloody fortune. Aye. Fear not, my lady. I shall soon have it back. No, no, no, no. Iwill soon have it back. Wewill soon have it back. Aye. This way. This way, my lady. MacLeod! This way is far better. No, we'll go this way. This way, miss. It's much easier this way. No, I can climb up here, my lady. It's no problem. Look at this. I'm already up. See? I'm already up. Almost over the wall. As you wish. That's much easier. Allow me to assist you, my lady. Thank you. Fitzcairn, can you help me? MacLeod! I'llget it back. MacLeod, you rascal! Quiet. Let's try this one. It's locked. It must have been stuck. Look at all this. That cutthroat has been robbing the colonies for the past 50 years. Then we'll just have to rob a little of it back, eh? Well, well, well. What have we here? Mice in the parlor, and Immortal mice, at that. I told you there was another way in. Didn't I tell you? Be quiet! I'd be careful who you call a mouse, especially if I was a rat. If you're a thief, I've never seen a comelier one. You're the thief! We're just protecting her assets. And they are... wonderful assets. If you please, sir! A gentleman does not address a lady in that manner! I'll have his head! Oh, don't be ridiculous! You being dead'll probably put her off her appetite. Let me deal with this. - I challenged him first! - Ach! You call that a challenge? Gentlemen, it seems you both wish to protect the lady's honor. Unfortunately, I can only fight one of you at a time. He's right. The only honorable thing to do will be to toss a coin for it. Fine, we'll toss for it. Go on, toss it. I am afraid I cannot. Why not? I haven't got one. So, how were you gonna take her out? A small loan. What, from me? Yes! Gentlemen! Thank you. Ready? Heads. Heads it is. Madame. Here. Hold that. Have we a quarrel I've forgotten about, sir? - Uh-- - Tell me. Just for my own curiosity. Why are we fighting? Ask the lady. 'Tis she you've wronged. But I've never had the pleasure of her company. I'm sure I would remember wronging so beautiful a lady. I beg your pardon! You wronged me when you stole a shipment of gold belonging to me. Hey, we're fighting here. I've been accused of many things, fair lady, but never-- never theft from such a beautiful woman. Hey! Let's get on with it. Come on. Duncan, perhaps there is no need for anyone to lose their head tonight. I'm sure the baron is willing to be reasonable. In the face of such beauty, how could I be otherwise? You flatter me, sir. Say something. You call that a fight? Well, if it wasn't for the lady, he'd be dead by now. Indeed, without her intervention, I would have been lost... forever. Oh, please! Spare us. You were lucky it was MacLeod you were fighting. Why, if it had been me, you'd be a foot shorter and an octave higher by now. If a wrong has been done, I shall right it. Allow me the honor of making my peace over dinner? What about the opera? Why don't you take Duncan? I don't even like him. Here. Take yourself to the opera. I don't wanna go on my own. Well, I'm not going with you. I'll come with you-- to the German ambassador's. Oh, you're out of your mind! I'll even eat the sauerkraut. Do you know, when I heard that voice, I said to myself, "That must be Fitzcairn. Either that, or a dog in heat." What in God's name are you doing here? I could ask you the same thing, butthe Lady Angelina requested a rendezvous with me today. Well, that's impossible. You must have mistaken the date, for you see, sir, today, the lady requested a rendezvous with me. "A matter of great importance to discuss with you." Same date. Same place. Ach, not again. Oh, I see. Yes! Now, I understand. What? Oh, yes. And if I'm right, and as we both know, I am seldom wrong where women are concerned, she wants to be a bride. But I'm not ready for marriage. Not you. It's me she wants, you daft Scot. You? Then why send me the letter, you daft Englishman? Well, isn't it obvious? No. She wants to break the bad news to you with me here to protect her. If you were more experienced, you'd understand these things. Lady Angelina, so nice to see you. Angelina, you look radiant. A summer flower in winter's garden. My two favorite champions. I'm so glad you've come. I've reached a great decision in my life. - To marry. - You guessed. Oh, well-- Well, actually, I guessed. No, you didn't. And I must say, my dear, you've made absolutely the right choice. I'm- - I'm so happy. I was afraid you wouldn't understand. I know it's unconventional, but you're both so special to me. I can't imagine doing it without either of you. Both of us? What exactly is it you want us to do? Give me away. This way. You realize none of this would have happened if she'd come to the opera with me that night. No, she would have seen you for the raving lunatic you are, and she would have been with me. I should have asked her to marry me, when I still had the chance. Ha! You married? You couldn't stay faithful to a woman for what? More than one hour? Well, I would have given it a fair try. Tell, me, pray. Why did you not ask her to marry you? I don't know. I'll tell you why. Because you knew with me still around, you did not stand a chance. No, it's because ofhim that we didn't have a chance. Oh, yes. Him. That pompous aristocrat. See the way she looks at him? Yes. I think I'm going to be sick. Well, we'll just have to bear up and give them our best. Him? The man who's taken the woman we love away from me? Well, look at her. She's happier than I've ever seen her. Ah. If we love her, we'll make sure she keeps her happiness. Come. Come on. Come on andsmile. So, they got married. And as much as Fitz and I hated it, there was one thing we couldn't deny. Their marriage was made in Heaven. I distinctly said pink linen. Pink, not white. Does this look pink? Does it? What's wrong with white? We had white last time. Exactly. I am sick of white! You said you wanted classic! I gave you classic! You- - White is classic! You call this classic? I asked you for a string quartet, not a rock band. What were you thinking of? I was trying to get it right. How? By not listening to me, Robert? Tell me. Do you hear anything I say? Every damn word! Then how come nothing ever changes? Did I come at a bad time? Not at all, Duncan. You came at exactly the right time. What for? To see you behaving like a spoiled brat? No, in time to help you clean up the mess. What mess? Oh, Gina, no. Not the Ming vase. Not the Ming-- What do you expect from a brat? So, how's it goin'? I could kill her. I could just... kill her. So, how long has this been going on? Too long. This wedding is a nightmare. I hire a rock group, she wants strings. I get a string quartet, she'll want rap. She's driving me crazy. Oh, Robert. Come on. Every marriage has its ups and downs. You have to expect that once in a while. Well, lately it's been all down. I'll be honest, Duncan. It hasn't been good for us since the '60s. It'll pass. It's not just the wedding. It's everything I say, everything I do. It's like living with a giant vulture who's just... waiting for me to screw up so she can tear my heart out. I never thought I'd say this, but I think it's over between us. I think we're history. Robert, you and her were meant for each other. No one ever loved you like she has. You know that. Tonight at midnight. Duchess. How nice to see you. My lord. Good day, Fitzcairn. So nice to see you again. I wish I could say the same for you, MacLeod. Do you think Fitz knows she's married? Do you think he cares? How many women do you think Fitz has bedded? A hundred? A thousand? Lady Caroline, I assure you, Hugh Fitzcairn is the most honorable of gentlemen. You cannot be serious. I'm trying to be delicate. Caroline and Fitz, they, uh- - What? You... and Fitz? Aye, they spent a lovely weekend together... in a country inn not so long ago. He stole my heart and my hand. Oh, so, you're engaged. Congratulations. Oh! Lady Caroline. I must say, my dear, you look simply ravishing tonight. So, I believe congratulations are in order. Yes, it's remarkable that they've stayed married for 100 years, isn't it? No, not to them. To you. To me? Yes. Caroline just told me. Told you? About your impending nuptials. She told you... we're getting married? Yes. Actually, she told everyone. After your weekend away, why wouldn't she? In 100 years, I expect we'll be here to celebrate youranniversary. You're a lucky man, Hugh Fitzcairn. In actuality, I spoke to Angelina and to Robert, and they've agreed for you to take your vows with them. So, congratulations. Would you excuse me one moment? Is something wrong? I need to discuss something with my lady. Lady Caroline, can we- - We need to talk. I am- - I mean, I didn't. Youdidn't. I wouldn't. Caroline is like a sister to me. I hope you wouldn't dare to hurt her... by bedding her but not wedding her. Would you? There's been a terrible mistake. Have you ever seen anything more pitiful? Calm yourself. I would rather marry a horse's ass. Oh, my lady! My lady, oh! Will my heart ever recover? But, and for that offense, I demand the next dance. My lady. Would you... mind? Not at all. How does he do it? Charm. Helping yourself to a few cookies? Angelina requested a private audience with me. She requested one with me. I never believed the marriage would last this long. Neither did I. I would have given it a month, maybe two. The poor thing doesn't realize what she's missing. Marriage is wasted on you, Fitzcairn. Ha! Who's talking about marriage? Still, if I was going to, I would marry her in a second. Duncan! Yes, Angelina? Is Robert back yet? No, I haven't seen him. He went for the priest hours ago. I can hardly get married without him. If I may, I would gladly stand in for the groom. The line starts here. Come and help me with my dress. Is my lady speaking to me? No, she's talking to both of us. That's the best offer you've had this century. Would you mind? Lady. Angelina, just a little token for your anniversary. Oh, thank you, Duncan. Oh, my pleasure. Where will you be going on your honeymoon? The Indies. Robert wants to go sailing there next spring. Adventurous, no? Not as adventurous as Paris. It's a dangerous place to be a-- an aristocrat. There's a revolution going on. Robert and I have been among its staunchest supporters. This house is protected, as are we all. The people know who their friends are. Ach! The people are great friends with the guillotine. MacLeod! He- - He worries so much. Nothing is going to happen while I'm still around to protect you. My lady! My lady! Forgive me, my lady, but the baron has been taken. Taken by whom? Revolutionaries. He has been taken to Place de Greve to-- to be... beheaded. Nothing will happen? I will take care of this, Angelina. Who was to know? Fitz! Help me get this off. Now? Do you think we have time? Robert is in trouble. Are you sure? I am sure I can't ride in a dress. Oh, yes. Of course. - Gina, you're mad to come with us. - This could be very dangerous. Why do you think I'm going along? He's right, for once. - The revolutionaries might recognize you. - Dressed like this? You are the ones who look like aristocrats now, - not me. - Do you think we should change, Duncan? There is no time. You know I won't leave Robert. - Aye, and I'll not leave you. - Neither will I. Come on, Fitzcairn! Where are you going, MacLeod? To Paris! Paris? Paris is this way! No, London's that way, ya idiot. And for crimes against the people and the Republic, you are sentenced to death. May God have mercy on your soul. The guillotine? Why couldn't they just hang him? Madame, Guillotin proved this to be far more humane. It's a scientific fact. Are you ready? - I'm ready. - I'm always ready. Aye. You are sentenced to death. May God have mercy on your soul. Are you ready, Fitzcairn? Now or never. Bonjour, monsieur. Get down boy! Have it your way! - Time to go! They don't seem to be very happy! I think we've upset them! We've been saved. This young boy is a real hero. This young lad is my wife. I don't quite know what you'd do without me, MacLeod. I can but dream. If we'd have been a moment later, she'd have made the most attractive widow. Don't you ever stop? My friend, the only thing that'll stop me is a blade. The woman's been impossible to live with. So, it's all her fault. Absolutely. She's bossy, she's opinionated. She never listens. Well, sounds like the woman we all fell in love with. Robert, it's been 300 years. You have to expect the ride to be bumpy once in a while. You know that. Oh, you're right. I'm such an idiot. That's the spirit. She is the only woman for me, and... we were meant for one another. I'll make it up to her and this'll all pass. Here's your chance. Robert? Could you come here, please? Look, Gina. I'm sorry. I've been a little uptight. We'll have the string quartet. We'll have the pink linen. Whatever it takes to make you happy, my love. It's not the music, Robert, or the linen. The wedding's not the problem. What then? Name it, my love, and it's yours. What I want is a divorce. She's leaving me, Mac. She's really leaving. Is there any chance she'll change her mind? She divided up the record collection. The vinyl? She's leavin'. I don't know what to do. I've tried making up. I've tried everything. Maybe if I bought her something special? I don't think that's the answer. There's a new Ferrari coming out. I know this dealer- - Robert. You could buy her every single car in Italy, and still it wouldn't change her mind. Whatever she wants, she doesn't want things. Duncan, she trusts you more than anyone else. You could talk to her? What? And say what? "Please, Gina. Give Robert another chance?" You could think of something better than that. I know you could. Please? Gina, give Robert another chance. He's had a thousand chances, Duncan. I gave that man the best centuries of my life. Then don't throw them away. Maybe it should have been over a long time ago. Oh, you don't mean that. He loves you. You love him. Maybe we are not meant to spend three centuries together. I mean, who mates for life? Swans? Geese? Lobster? Robert and you were meant to. You know that. Sometimes, I think about the old days. Remember? When it was just you, me and Fitz? I thought you loved me then. We both did. But not as much as you love Robert. When you set eyes on him, you couldn't even see us. My mistake. Now, Fitz is dead and the old days are gone. Now, it's all habit, like putting on an old pair of shoes. We'll both start new lives. It's time, Duncan. All things come to an end. What did she say? I tried. I-I really did. What am I gonna do? Well, maybe you were right. Maybe it's time to move on. I wasn't right. She loves me. Then, give her time. We've been together for 300 years. She's part of me. I don't know how to be anyone except part of us. What if something happened to her and I lost her forever? I'd go crazy. I couldn't cope. What if something happened to you? It would kill her, but what's gonna happen to me? You are one clever S.O.B. That's brilliant! You're a genius! You challenge me. I let you win. Gina rushes to my rescue, saves me, loves me forever. No, no, no. It would never work. She would never believe that we would fight to the death. Oh, it's hopeless. Maybe not. It's finally happened. You've lost your mind. Well, come on, Methos. You'd be doing them an incredible favor. Read my lips. N-O. Okay, you'd be doing me a favor. Milk? Aw, that's not fair. You're making it personal now. Y-Y-You think that I'll f-feel guilty when I say no? Sugar? Wasting your time. I haven't felt guilt since the 11th century. I don't even know these people. Yeah, well, that's why I'm asking you. All ya have to do is act a little. Do I look like an actor? Well, you've been with the Watchers for years, and no one's ever suspected you. Don't you wanna see Gina and Robert live happily ever after? Yeah, but I wanna seeme live happily ever after even more. Oh, come on, Methos. They won't even know who you are. You'll just be this mysterious Immortal, who's coming after Robert's head. Robert and Gina's marriage is in your hands. You're not listening to me. I don't give a damn about their marriage. - Well, I do. - Is it really that important to you? Yes, it's that... important to me. Okay, I do this for you, and you give me the barge. Right. Like you're serious. Yeah, I'm serious. Hey, I need a place to live. That's the deal. Take it or leave it. Fine. If that's what it takes. Fine. That's what it takes. - Good. - Good. - Right. - You better make it look good. Like you say, darling, I'm an actor. Oh, good. But who is this other Immortal? Where did Robert meet him? I'm not sure. I think he's one of those young ones that kills for sport. I think he's good. You don't think he could actually win? I don't know. Robert didn't seem to have the old fire. It's as if-- It's as if he had nothing to live for. Blackbeard-- Bluebeard, Drake. I must have sailed with half the pirates in the Caribbean! I kinda miss those old ships. Not me. I hate the sea. Oh? Why is that? I crossed the Atlantic to Iceland with a bunch of Irish monks, in 765. Six of us in a rowboat. No facilities. Showtime. Robert! Leave him alone, you bastard! Gina! Gina! You can't interfere! Gina! Gina, wait! It goes hip, head, hip, thrust, jump back. Yes, of course. Sorry. He could lose his head! Gina, no! If he does, it'll be the last thing that guy sees. That should do it. Just give me a jab, not too deep. Wuss! Where's your sense of drama? Robert! No, Gina! No! No! Robert! No! Sorry. Robert! Gina! Gina! Robert! Gina, no! Gina, no! No, Gina! You're dead! Bastard! You're dead! Gina! Oh, my God, Robert. Robert, are you all right? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Robert. You- - What was that about? You were supposed to keep her away! Get out of here! Go! She was gonna kill me! You'll be all right. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean what I said. I'll never leave you, Robert. Never. Oh, Gina. I love you, Robert. I love you. I love you so much. I love you, too, Gina-- He's gone. I think Gina scared him off. I don't think we'll see him again. I do. I'm going to find that bastard and take his head, if it's the last thing I do. I knew it. I knew it! Getting between a married couple. It's a rule I haven't broken for 2,000 years. I knew this would happen. Look, she'll cool off. I'm just telling you to be careful. That's all. Great! So I lose my head after 5,000 years, so that you can play marriage guidance counselor. I must have been out of mymind! Oh, Methos. Come on. The marriage is in two days' time. All you have to do is lay low for a while. They'll go off on their honeymoon. They'll be there for... 10 years. She'll forget all about this. Stake your life on that, would you? Y-Yeah. - Okay, gimme the keys. - What keys? The keys to the barge. You weren't serious. You were testing me. No. If I'm gonna die, you're gonna pay me for it. Gimme the keys. I can't give you the barge. I just redecorated it. Nice job. Gimme the keys. - Come on. - With friends like you, who needs enemies? I was just thinking the same thing. Off. What? It's my chair. My chair now. You know where the door is. Have a nice day. You saved my marriage, Duncan. I don't know how I'm gonna thank you enough. You and your friend, Pierson. He, uh, didn't have to try quite so hard, there. Yeah, but it worked, didn't it? Oh, Mac. You should've seen her. She was an animal. It turned around so much that night, she, uh-- We may have to try this again some time. Forget it. Where is she? Robert. Um, we had another little argument. Oh, not again. What now? Well, I wanted you to be my best man, and she wanted you to give her away. Tell her either way is fine. You can tell her yourself. I will. When she gets back from your place. My- - My place! Is something wrong? Come on. Come on. What? What? Opera, opera, opera, opera. A lot of opera here. Gotta do something about this music. There's no Springsteen. There's no Queen. - You! - I can explain. It was a joke. I'm not laughing. Where is MacLeod? Dead? No. No, no. He's fine. This has all just been a big mistake. Huge. And you made it when you tried to kill my husband. - I knew this would happen. Oh, my God! This is a mess. Would he hurt her? Would she go for his head? Yes, she would. This is a mess. Gina! What happened? It's over. The son of a bitch is dead. You took his head? He tried for Robert, tried to kill the man I love. No one does that and lives. No! Sorry about the mess in there. No! No! No! It was all an act! Tell her-- Not funny! Oh, I don't know. Pretty funny from here. Oh, really? I think I should take your head. How about that? Would you like that? What's the matter, Duncan? Can't you take a joke? Fitz would have found it funny. So, are you going to give me away? No. Oh, please, Duncan? Please? All right. Here, take her. Go on, for God's sake. Look at this place. Never seen such a mess. These sheets are disgusting! Hey! Enough with the mess. I have to live here. Oh, I'm sorry. My wedding present to them. Only one of six left in the world. You know, when I was living in China, way back when, those things were a dime a dozen. If only I'd known then what I know now. Pity. So what are you gonna get 'em? A toaster? Well, you know, you were right. They are a unique couple, - so I figured I should give them something unique. - Yeah? Like what? - My boat. - The barge? You can't give them the barge! Why not? Because- - It's my boat. I'll do what I like with it. Fine. But then, I figured everyone would give them something unique, - so, uh, I went with a toaster! You keep the barge. I hate the water. That! That co-- Have a nice cleanup. And here we are We're the princes of the universe Here we belong fighting for survival We've come to be the rulers of your world I am immortal I have inside me blood of kings Yeah! I have no rival No man can be my equal Take me to the future of your world Closed-Captioned By Captions, Inc. Los Angeles There are many facets to assessing a diamond, you understand? No pun intended. There is, naturally, color and size to take into consideration, but, uh, quality, as well. For instance, this stone, four carats, only a very slight occlusion. Yeah. The finish is lousy. Its proportion sucks. It's got at least one extra facet. Major imperfections. It's crap. Did you cut this one yourself? Monsieur is in the diamond trade? Monsieur does not trade. He collects. Do you see how beautiful she is? The diamond has to be at least as perfect, and I don't care how much it costs. They say it's part of the great Koh-i-nor diamond. It was made for an English prince's daughter. Around 40 carats. Is this the best you have? It's the best anyone has. Do you fancy this one, love? Then I'll take it. Excellent. And, uh, how does monsieur choose to pay? No, no, no. I said I'll take it. I didn't say anything about paying for it. I wouldn't bother with that alarm if I were you. It'll be over before you know it. - What are you doing, Morgan? Wait, this isn't how we planned it. But I'm afraid this is the way it is. Help me! I can't breathe. Help me! Don't make a scene, love. It'll be over in a minute. He is Duncan MacLeod, the Highlander. Born in 1592, in the Highlands of Scotland, and he is still alive. He is immortal. For 400 years, he's been a warrior, a lover, a wanderer, constantly facing other Immortals in combat to the death. The winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power. I am a Watcher, part of a secret society of men and women... who observe and record, but never interfere. We know the truth about Immortals. In the end, there can be only one. May it be Duncan MacLeod, the Highlander. Here we are Born to be kings We're the princes of the universe I am immortal I have inside me blood of kings I have no rival No man can be my equal Take me to the future of your world Would you mind telling me what it's about? Maybe I could help. Hello? Hello? You like this with everybody or is it just me? "Oh, I'm sorry for dragging you out of bed, Mr. MacLeod." "What, at 5:00 in the morning?" "Oh, but this is a matter of national security." "National security?" Come on, listen up. This is your part. Nice talking to you. Ah, Monsieur MacLeod. I'd like to thank you for your cooperation. I was under the impression I didn't have any choice. One always has a choice. But, uh, coming in voluntarily is so much more civilized... than being put in handcuffs, don't you agree? I'm all for civilization. Now I want to know why I'm here. Maybe my colleague can explain it better. I believe you know Agent Delaney from the American C.I.D. Yeah, we've come into contact once. - Briefly. It was a completely different matter. -Oh, Renee, if you wanted to talk, why didn't you come by the barge? - This is French police business, Mr. MacLeod. - Oh, you can call me Duncan. Okay, Duncan. You can call me Agent Delaney. And you can call me Inspector Dufay. Agent Delaney is here to assist us in a serious criminal matter, Monsieur MacLeod. We hoped you'd be able to assist us as well. There's been a series of robberies in the Paris area-- - And murders. - And they fit a pattern I've investigated before. Really? Am I a suspect? Not at this point. Well, that's really, uh, gratifying to hear. Maybe you just brought me in for moral support. Having an attitude won't make this any easier. In going through the files on the suspect, your name kept coming up too. We were hoping you could help tell us something about him. That depends. Who'd you have in mind? His name is Xavier St. Cloud. Suspect's male. He has very expensive taste. Good. That sort of narrows down half the population of Paris. He has a passion for rare jewelry. And he kills to get it, and he uses gas. I'd say that narrows it down quite a bit. Sorry. I can't tell you anything. Two days ago, he hit a jewelry store, and three people are dead. Still nothing to tell us? I'm sorry. I can't help. Now is there anything else? Good. Then I'll be going. Inspector Dufay. Agent Delaney, it's been so nice seeing you again. Duncan! Duncan, wait. It wasn't me who dragged you down here. It was Dufay. I did my best to keep you out of it. Then I guess my thanks are in order. I have nothing to hide. Right. Last time I was chasing St. Cloud, you were right in the middle of it. Look, I know you're one of the good guys. Just give me a hand here. You know I wouldn't screw you. I-- I didn't mean-- Not that I-- I-- I do this around you. It's okay. Just give me something. You're after the wrong guy. How do you know? Xavier St. Cloud is dead. What? Wait, you can't just walk away after dropping a bomb on me like that. What makes you so sure? I've got a reliable source. Whoever's out there is not Xavier St. Cloud. That's it? That's all you're gonna tell me? Renee, I'll see you around. Well, I'm sorry about the cold shoulder. I-I figured you wouldn't want the cops knowing about us. Knowing about what? What happened between us. Not much as I seem to remember. Would you, you know, do the guy-thing? - Do the guy-thing? - Yeah. Help my engine. What seems to be the problem? Three thousand pounds of ugly tin just doesn't like me. Let's take a look. Now I want you to know, ordinarily, I don't let strangers in my apartment. Unless you trust them? No. Unless I have a gun. Well, I want to make it clear whatever it was, it's over. Ah, if you say so. I'm engaged. - Really? - His name's Paul. He's a lawyer in Washington. He's even thinking of running for Congress. I thought you took an oath to fight crime? Duncan, be serious. I don't want this to-- I don't want us to be enemies. Say something. Congratulations. Ah, Morgan d'Estaing. Nice to see you again. Duncan. So nice of you to drop in. Come on, MacLeod. It's a little bit smoky, isn't it, MacLeod? Come on! I got you. I'm gonna get your head. I'm getting nearer. I'm getting nearer! Come on! Monsieur, are you hurt? I'm okay. I had a smashing time. Remember, don't try this at home. Nice place you have here. Thanks. Government housing. I'm out as soon as the next congressional junket arrives. So, is this a social call? It's about your case. I thought you couldn't help us? Changed my mind. Why? Did you take a walk and meet a Good Samaritan? Something like that. I want to see your files on Xavier St. Cloud. The dead guy? Well, we got to start somewhere. This is what we have. St. Cloud's wanted for unsolved cases all over Europe. The police couldn't get close to him. Came and went like a ghost. Until two years ago. That's not in the files. Well, word gets around. Obviously. They figured he was on some tropic island sipping pina coladas. My guess was our boy came out of retirement. Except this is not our guy. He's got the same targets, same M.O. They even found some of the same gas in the victims' bodies. Who else could it be? Duncan, I-- My gut tells me there's something happening here and-- Like what? I just want to be very clear. If we do this together, it's strictly professional? Strictly. Look, I want you to, uh, check on another file for me. You have a name? Yeah. Morgan d'Estaing. - A toast! - Yes. A toast, everybody! - Ah, Morgan. -What's the occasion? The war with the British isn't going well. Have I, uh, have I forgotten a birthday or something? I was out riding the estate. I should change. What is it? What's wrong? - Philippe, tell him. - Things have changed, Morgan. Emily, play, please. Play. When we thought we'd remain childless, we adopted you to carry our ancient family name, to carry on the d'Estaing line. But I know all this. You never kept it a secret. Then Bernard was born. And I had a brother. How does that change anything? It changes everything. It means you're not to inherit the d'Estaing estate... or the title. All that will go to Bernard. Of course, you'll get a monthly allowance. An allowance? But it's mine. By rights, it should go to me. I'm the oldest son. Adopted son. I'm a d'Estaing. I'm- - I'm one of you. In name only. Bernard is a true d'Estaing. I loved you as a son. Your son! Try to understand. You'll have a place here. But Bernard will be master of the estate. It can be no other way. I'm sorry. Sleep, little brother. Sleep. Help me! Help! Bernard! No! Morgan, get off of him! Let him go! Monster. Well, look what we have here. A new boy. Want to stay? I didn't think so. They tried to kill me. I was their son. I loved them, and they buried me alive. Even they wouldn't try that. Believe me, you were quite dead when they put you in this casket. - You're insane. - You'll understand it all in time. Come. We have much to talk about. They're gonna pay for what they did to me, all of them. Pretty, isn't it? Ah, it's beautiful. You changed a bit. You noticed. Mm, yeah. Yeah. Cut your hair. Cut my hair. Nice new clothes. Try, yeah. - Styling these days. - It's hard on a government salary, but-- They don't have this in Washington. Yeah, Paris is a beautiful city. God, this was a great idea, Duncan. So how long are you gonna stay? Mm, depends. On what? Xavier? How long it takes to solve the case. I haven't eaten on a boat since I was a child. This is a great idea, Duncan. Yeah, well, there's more to life than just work. What's this? Well, I work with him, you work with me. We're all in this together, right? Yeah. One big, happy family. Right. May I join you? Looks like you already have. We are running a check on d'Estaing. I have never heard of him, but if he has a record, we'll find it. Provided he isn't dead. MacLeod! It's good to see you again. - It's been a while. - You didn't call. You didn't come by. I've missed ya. - Oh. - But, uh, I see you've been busy. Duncan, are you gonna introduce your friend? No. I don't think he really has time. We've got something to discuss, now. - I'll be seeing you again. - Yeah. It won't take long. Be back real soon. So first the jewelry store, then the warehouse. - Who you going after next? - Xavier taught me well. In fact, he taught me everything I know. The English will be here any minute. The war's at our doorstep. We must hurry. Emily, fetch your mother. Papa. My God. Am I seeing a ghost? This is not possible. Mama! Hello, Father. Hello, Emily. It can't be you. You're dead. And this is all a nightmare that will end when you die. Wait. Gently, Morgan. You'll have what's coming to you. Who are you? Xavier St. Cloud. Think of me as a friend of the family. Please, sit down. -The d'Estaing family... took centuries to acquire land, titles and wealth. But the revolution took your titles, Napoleon took your land, and the English army is about to take your wealth. There is nothing left. I doubt that. You've never been known as a careless man. Would you flee your estate penniless and unprotected? A stash of jewelry, perhaps? Silver? I told you there is nothing. We're wasting time. Why not cut their throats and have done with it? You're going to be around a long time, Morgan. You have to learn patience. This is monstrous. Barbaric. You're one to talk. I've spent a lifetime studying pain. How it travels along the nerves to the brain. Of course, certain areas contain more nerves than others-- the hand, the tongue. Well, you can imagine the possibilities. I'm prepared to suffer. Perhaps. But what about them? What do you say, Baron? Give me the money... and you and your family can be on your way... or wait here for the English to march in. Tell him, Papa, tell him. - If you promise to let my family live-- - You have my word. In the cabinet... behind the bottles. Take it and go. You've given your word. Then let us drink on it as gentlemen. Anything to get that monster... - out of our lives forever. - Cheers. Come, Morgan. But we haven't finished. Morgan, come. Ah! We were supposed to kill them, all of them. Calm yourself. A few moments and they'll be silent forever. The wine. You've put poison in their wine. Never bloody your hands unless you must. Thus endeth the first lesson. - But you gave him your word. - I gave you my word. And it's not whether you give your word. It's who you give it to. Perhaps one day you'll betray me. And that will be the second lesson. This way, men. Secure the grounds. Come. Soldier, take him. We'll put the colonel's office in the house. The men's tents can go in the yard. Yes, sir. See if the owners are in the house. Ask them to surrender the property. Xavier. MacLeod, I'm touched you remembered. One could hardly forget those that kill their friends. It's a shame we're not alone. You'd be dead by now. Wars can be so troublesome, can't they? On the other hand, they can be quite convenient. Aye, for those who want to make a profit by them. Is that why you're here? Perhaps you'll think me sentimental, but I couldn't bear to think of the treasures of France in the hands of the English. So you decided to liberate them. On the contrary. This is Morgan d'Estaing. The only remaining heir, my prot? g? . Lieutenant MacLeod, we found the family, sir. All dead. It must have been suicide when they heard us coming. A tragedy, really. Now, if you'll excuse us. My friend needs to grieve. Come, Morgan. We'll see each other again. Yes. We'll look forward to it. Tell me, did you think it was him back there? Do you feel his presence now? I do. Did you think he was a zombie back from the dead? Do you feel the hate? You know, it's funny, Morgan. There's a difference between hate and fear. I hated Xavier. You're just a cheap imitation. I'm not an imitation, MacLeod. I'm a homage. A tribute to a great artist. Yeah. One you killed. Excuse me, sir. A present from the gentleman. Chateau d'Estaing? Ah, wonderful. Your friend is unusually generous. Definitely unusual. Mmm. Perfect. Thank you. Xavier got what he deserved. Maybe you're right. Maybe we all get what we deserve. That is impressive. Fair's fair. No! Put it down! Put it down! -Stop! Put the glass down! - What? - Please, monsieur. -What the hell are you doing? Tell the Captain to get an ambulance! Is there a doctor onboard? Is anyone a doctor? He's dead. But how did you know about the wine? Xavier didn't like to kill face-to-face. He used poison, gas, bombs. It's his trademark. But Xavier's dead. Morgan worked with Xavier. That was the guy at the restaurant was Morgan? Why didn't you say anything? What kind of game are you playing here, MacLeod? Merci. No prints. He injected the poison through the cork. Curare derivative. No known antidote. Well, this guy knew what he was doing. He had a good teacher. He also went to a lot of trouble. This wine was worth a fortune. Trace the bottle. According to this report, this wine hasn't been available for decades. - It shouldn't even exist. - Well, try the wine cellars. In France? There's thousands. - It'd be easier to trace a handgun in L.A. - Yeah. Any ideas? I'll let you know. - Got any more tricks? - You don't waste time. Ah, should have used another wine. But then you wouldn't know where to find me. Why bring mortals into this? Why kill the inspector? Because I could. You're just like Xavier. He was a prince, and he treated me like one. And his gift to you was murder. Justice on a family that used me, then betrayed me when I was no longer useful. Xavier gave me my revenge. Now I'm gonna give him his. - Seems your cavalry has arrived, MacLeod. Another time. Freeze! Well, there's enough evidence to link d'Estaing to the robberies. Let's hope there's some rare bottles of wine... like the one he used to kill the inspector. I hope the inspector appreciated it. You scumbag. That's all right. He's a problem for the French police now. But not for long, MacLeod. Soon I'll be somebody else's problem. I don't think so. Get him out of here. She's quite something, you know. Young, fiery, intense, but, oh, so temporary. She's nothing to me. Oh, spare me. The minute you two are alone, she'll be over you like a bitch in heat. Come here-- Whoa. Sorry. Who does that murdering bastard think he is? Where'd he get that stuff about us? You followed me. Uh, like I had a choice. My intuition said you had a lead and you weren't sharing, turns out I was right. Yeah, but we agreed to trust each other. We agreed to work together. How'd you know where to find him? Intuition. It's not good enough, MacLeod. Listen, you be careful of d'Estaing. He can be very dangerous. Oh, we can handle him. Look, there's a few more questions I'd like to ask you. Oh, Duncan. Oh, don't make me pull rank here, Duncan. I'm a cop. I could have you brought in again. You don't have the death penalty here, do you? Not since 1981, Agent Delaney. That's too bad. I could pull the switch on this creep myself. Has he got a lawyer yet? He didn't want one. That's weird. Oh, no! Quick! Get a doctor. You don't get off that easy. Live! Live! Damn it! He's dead. I guess he didn't need a lawyer after all. Somebody stole him from the morgue. Well, maybe nobody stole him. Maybe he just got up and walked away. Very funny. Somebody had to be in it with him. But why? What good is a dead body? What do you think? I don't want to think about it anymore. Whatever happened, it's over. Morgan's dead, and I'm off the case. This is it. Thanks for walking me home. Oh, no problem. You sure you're gonna be okay? Yeah. Duncan, now that this is over, I don't think we should see each other anymore. You sure? Yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. Uh, I think I should probably come up. I don't think it's a good idea. Just to talk. I mean, uh, honest. Scout's honor. Here, let me... give you a hand. Yep. You want something to drink? I have some wine or-- Actually, forget the wine. I've kind of gone off wine lately. Coffee's fine. Okay. I'll put some on. Coffee, I mean. Won't be long now. Soon as I hand in my report, that's it. Back to the States. Well, it must be hard being away from someone you care about. Oh, Paul, the guy you're gonna marry? Oh. Paul. Yes. I thought-- Ab-Absolutely. Well, you'd like him. He's, you know, a normal guy. Not that you're not normal. I mean-- I know what you mean. He's steady. 9:00 to 5:00. No secrets. No danger. Just what I need. Well, I hope you'll be very happy together, okay? Um, I'm gonna get this coffee-- Excuse me. Duncan, you think there was anything to what Morgan said... about you and me and how it was so obvious? You think he's crazy? About some things. When we kissed, did-- did you feel anything, like your spine melting were talking hot dogs and chips and now we're at petit fours? How did we get there? There's a lot of humor to it, also. There was a lot of, you know, camaraderie between the girls. Not how you play this game. Roxy: Oh. It is to reveal something that no one would guess about you. Like have you named your lady parts? Um... China. China? As in, only the best dine on my fine China. [ Laughter ] Did you steal that from somebody? No, I had to teach my niece how to treat herself nicely. And I said, "That's China" because it's precious and it's fragile." It's fine China. [ Both laugh ] Okay, well, mine used to be A Day At The Beach. What about you, Roxy? - Uh, she's had so many names. - Come on. But now I'm going with Rattlesnake Canyon. [ Laughter ] Brown: It was sort of like Claudia Joy and Denise, and then you have Pamela and Roxy. And Roland was just friend to all. [ Sighs ] Our husbands are deploying and now the only man in our harem is leaving, too. Roland was a man who had a lot of really beautiful women for friends. So, that's pretty unique. - You want to talk about it? - About what? Whatever it is that's made you dry that same glass since I got here. These women, he would do anything for because they did the same thing for him. Denise: We're not gonna let this baby have a moment's rest while Joan's away. She's got four more mamas now. What I also really love about our friendships is that, like, we all had these, like, really big fights and disagreements. Like, there was a huge fight - between Claudia Joy and Denise... - Yes. Over Jackie. - What the hell, Claudia Joy? - What? Do you have to contradict everything I say? I'm sorry. I thought you wanted my opinion. I'm beginning to wonder. We had a huge fight when you thought that Roxy was getting a little bit too close with Whit. Remember? - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. He is just a friend. Why can't you just leave it alone? Because he was just a friend the last time you slept with him. Shut up, Pamela. Just shut up. That's what friendships are. We went through, like, big, big things. Roland: - Denise. - Hey, Roland. You didn't return my call. Brown: When Roland has his affair, the only person that knew about it was Denise. [ Sighs ] Oh, Roland. It was a one-time thing. Denise had judged you quite harshly. It's been all of us and you and... And now I'm just another man. Brown: Denise had her problems with it, but ultimately was able to say, "You're my friend. I love you. Whatever I can do to support you, I'll do that." Hey. What's going on? What are you guys doing here? Roxy: We didn't know if you'd heard, but there's a really stupid rumor going around. Brown: And then we all came to find out that Denise had her affair, as well. It's true. What? I said it's true. I'm late. I can't talk right now. And she was sort of walking around posed with the Scarlet A on her chest. I didn't know where else to go. I can't talk right now. Denise: It's over. There's nothing left for me here. I mean, I'd probably act the same way. No, you wouldn't. You'd be there for them the same way you were there for me. And then he later told the tribe... I had an affair. Denise never stopped being my friend. She never abandoned me. That's what he was trying to say. Like, we've meant too much to each other to let that love go without fighting for it. Claudia Joy: We love you, Denise. We didn't do a very good job showing it. Yeah, we're pretty much idiots. No. I'm the one who owes the apology. Brown: We can't just start fracturing off from one another - because somebody does something that you don't like. - No, you stick by. You fight and you make up and you don't hold grudges and you just, you know, keep loving each other. Claudia Joy, we're a match. - Yes, we are. - No. No, what I mean is that we are a medical match. That was a really close friendship. When you were diagnosed, I got tested to see if I could give you one of my kidneys. I can. Denise. Please just say yes. Our husbands were really close. We had been together for years. They'd go, you know, to the gates of hell for each other. Absolutely. What about the group hugs, guys? I mean, it started in the pilot. Pressman: We're like this. We're ending the scene, "Really? Okay." - Another hug. Brown: - I'm coming in. Always drinking and always hugging. - But Sterling liked it. - I don't mind. - [ Chuckles ] - Somebody had to do it. I'm so blessed to have you all in my life. These are my people. That's what we do... we hug. Yeah, these are our people. I'm very proud to be a Marine wife. I'm proud of my husband for fighting for our country. I'm proud of my children for their sacrifice, and we all just pull together. They fight for their brothers, they fight for their sisters, they fight for us. Not everyone's made out for the military and, you know, I just really respect my husband and value what he does. And I let him know it every day. [ Voice breaking ] It just makes me proud to be able to stand beside him and say that that's my husband, that's my soldier, and that's my hero. [ Cheers and applause ] _ I want to thank you, families and friends, for your support. Your presence here today reminds us of what we fight for. Soldiers of the 23rd, fall out. [ Cheers and applause ] Serpico: I think when the show first started that they might very well have seen the husbands or the soldiers as kind of ancillary to the story. While it is a show called "Army Wives," we are the context that their heroism shines in. Whenever the army enlists a soldier, it signs up a family, as well. And because of you, we are the strongest fighting force in the world. McNamara: My oldest brother, Christopher, is a retired Navy captain. And this was me imitating my brother Chris. Nobody comes back from a combat zone the same person they were before. I don't have to tell you that. - But some soldiers need more guidance than others. - Understood, sir. Your father was a soldier, and you had a little more of a connection with Frank. Having grown up in the military and having grown up the son of a soldier, I personally felt a huge responsibility. From the moment I got the audition, I'm looking at this and I'm like, "Really? God, I got this." Sorry I let you down, sir. No, you didn't let me down. You let yourself down. I just knew immediately that I know this guy inside and out. It wasn't just a uniform. It wasn't just a job. This was the epitome of once a soldier, always a soldier. You got a minute, sir? Yeah. What's on your mind? General Holden and Colonel Sherwood were good friends on a personal level. And I would still call you sir. Well, our intel is that you're not much of a cook. [ Chuckles ] It's your wife's words, sir. Not mine. I call my dad. It's like, "Would I ever just call him Michael?" - [ Davis laughs ] - "Mike or something?" It's like, "Uh, no. He still outranks you so it's still sir." Roger that, sir. _ Three, two. Contact east. Small arms developing the situation. The first few seasons, most of the action, the plot took place at Fort Marshall. [ Gunfire ] What you saw in later seasons, you saw more action from places like Afghanistan. Let's go. We're moving. The filmmaking of those scenes is a kind of guerilla filmmaking. [ Explosion ] They say "Go," and you have to charge up that hill and things are going off, exploding all around you. Let's move! Move, move, move! [ Gunfire ] Serpico: Pretending to be a soldier just feels like the artifice is just too much, you know? Davis: And those aren't real bullets, and those aren't real explosions, you know? - Yeah. - And that's... Right. McNamara: But at the end of the day, that's how we honor them because the more real we make it, the more their heroism is in context. [ Gunfire ] Incoming! Biank: It was an important element to add because what those soldiers experienced in a war zone, they bring that back with them. [ Cheers and applause ] You know, I'm also really glad that our show dealt with a lot of the challenges that soldiers deal with when they come home, you know, with the post-traumatic stress disorder, TBI, addiction. Trevor. Did you take these? - Leave me alone. - How many did you take? Fuller: There was a time when Trevor is going through a drug addiction. He was addicted to pain-killers because he really wanted to rehab his shoulder as quick as possible to get back to his men. I feel ashamed. Ashamed for getting wounded, ashamed for not being with my unit, ashamed for getting hooked on the pills. It's hard. It's a very real topic that so many people are struggling with on a daily basis. Can I ask you something? How long before everything feels normal again? It never does. Davis: I was excited to have the opportunity to really bring post-traumatic stress disorder to the public. Also, we dealt with TBI. Traumatic Brain Injury... Can you see me, baby? Yes. I can see you. Which is also a big challenge for a lot of soldiers returning from war. The treatment for TBI is rehabilitation, re-training your brain, essentially. Joan dealt with these two conditions and was able to sort of overcome them fairly quickly. But in real life, they can be a lifelong struggle. This is a magazine, something that you... read. There were certainly times where we felt like we were selling something short because we had to shorten it. I think that's good for the audience to know. You know, hopefully the issues were dealt with in an honest way. Four weeks off post-head shrinking after your last tour in Afghanistan? You gonna go there? Everybody knows if General Holden wasn't our guardian angel, you'd have been drummed out of the army by now. McNamara: And you had some challenges. - Yeah. - A woman in a man's world. Even on our set, it was sort of a man's world. - Absolutely. - Attention! As you were. I'm looking for Prospect Kanessa Jones. I felt a great deal of responsibility to do my absolutely best to represent women in the military and, more specifically, women of color. People always stand up for you like that? Oh, yeah. I'm a lieutenant colonel. I'm in charge of 1,400 soldiers. At ease. I think men and women struggle with deployments, but being a mother leaving her children... Thank you. We'll be ready, sir. That was very, very difficult and something that she couldn't share. [ Cries ] There's an amazing deployment scene when Joan leaves her entire family. And she has a special conversation with her son, David, that really sort of epitomizes what Joan is dealing with. Don't worry about me. Mom will be safe. I want to give you something. Don't forget me. [ Sniffles ] Of course not. [ Chuckles ] Although Joan often chose the army, it was at a very high cost emotionally. Serpico: Any career soldier is gonna have that same experience, that they have chosen the army over their family - on numerous occasions. - Right. And that's the contract that they sign... not just physically, but that's the emotional contract - that they sign with honor. - Absolutely. It's very interesting, then, on flip side, you have the Chase character. He had to lose his family... In order to understand that that's exactly what to value them, in a way. What is this? That is my request to transfer out of Delta. Do you think Chase missed it? Davidson: I certainly do. I do think Chase missed it. But everybody has to figure those things out for their own family. Right now... I feel like the luckiest guy on the face of the Earth. People who don't know what military families go through, we told that story. Welcome home. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you for your service. I'm pretty proud that we told it certainly as best as we could, out of respect. The funerals, especially when Jeremy passed away... You saw it all in slow motion and, to be honest with you, I think that's how any of us would feel, like time would just stop. Unfortunately, I've had to attend memorial services for fallen Marines, sailors, soldiers. So that always really hits close to home. It was very emotional for me as a fan. Oh, my gosh. That was, like, the most horrible thing. But it was real, and that's what I loved about the show. Not everybody always survives. We all know that. - Is Molly asleep? - Finally. - Great. - And you get some cake? I will, yeah. Ooh. I wonder what that's gonna be like. - What? - Well, Tanya. She's gonna be an army wife and a soldier. - If you ask me, it's hard enough to just be one. - Yeah. She's a smart girl. She's find her way. [ Chuckles ] Hmm. Claudia Joy. Gentlemen. Man: Sorry to disturb, Mrs. Holden. We were informed that a Mrs. Denise Sherwood is in attendance. Is she present? I'm Denise Sherwood. - Mrs. Sherwood, why don't we step... - Please tell me. - Ma'am, I really think we should... - Just tell me. Say it. Ma'am, the Secretary of the army has asked me to express his deep regret. Serpico: The loss of Jeremy... I still can't help but feel that personally. The Secretary sends his deepest sympathy to you and your family in this tragic loss. [ Denise sobs ] The casualty assistance officer will contact you within 24 hours. Brown: I think that episode in particular, we all pretty much universally recognize as being sort of the pinnacle of, like, what the show was. We had to do it. If we didn't lose one of the soldiers on the show, we'd be denying a big part of their existence, their reality as military families. Denise: Molly never even met him. She'll never know her big brother. I kept that script from people until the very last minute 'cause I wanted them to react freshly to it, and they did. I was staying with Drew at the time. And he said, "Have you read the script?" I said, "No, not yet." He said, "You should check it out." I read the script and was just bawling. And I came out, and he's like, "Yeah, man. Yeah, I know." McNamara: He put fives boxes of tissues in front of my spot at the table read... - Yeah. - ...when we read that script. Michael: Has that been confirmed? Over. Roger that. Airborne One, out. [ Helicopter blades whirring ] Just the way General Holden walked up to Frank, and he didn't have to say anything. - There was no dialogue was needed. - Whew. Well, just heard the Bravo Company kicked some serious ass today, sir. Yep. Bravo took it to them. But there were casualties, Frank. Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. Fuller: It was an interesting dichotomy to see how you needed to be alone with it and Denise, on the other side of the world, needed a group hug and everyone to be there. He's dead, Roland. I know. My little boy is dead. [ Sobbing ] Brannagh: That moment was just such a sinking feeling. Even to not have that in my life, but to think upon anybody's life in the military and think of that moment. Them coming up was just so deeply upsetting. Pressman: There's this weird thing when you're holding hands that's like, "I really hope that this is not for me." - "But if it's you, I want to be there for you." - You're there for them. - Do you know what I mean? - Mm-hmm. And it kind of felt like whatever this is, - like, we're in it together. - Yeah. It was really powerful. - Private Burnett. Burnett: - Here, Sergeant. - Private Lazarcheck. - Here, sergeant. Specialist Sherwood. Specialist Jeremy Sherwood. Specialist Jeremy T Sherwood. We've done that ritual a number of times on the series of calling roll after a soldier has passed. And you call it three times, just saying their last name first and then their rank and name and then their rank and full name. Sergeant, Specialist Jeremy T Sherwood was killed at Kandahar province, Afghanistan. Taking the moment... and not just one moment, but another moment and another moment to recognize his sacrifice and know that he was the guy on your right or your left and he fought for you, it's pretty great. [ "Taps" plays ] The funeral, the military service, this was something the show had to get right. Lord, hold us in our loss and hear our prayers for Jeremy Sherwood. It was excellent, the way they paid tribute to this fallen soldier. It was very, very well done. In fact, I'm getting chills just remembering that. It was really well done. They nailed it. Melvoin: I think one of the enduring themes of the show is how the living have to help people get past the loss of loved ones. To see how a family and a family of friends draws together in a time of great loss and crisis. ♪ bright morning stars ♪ ♪ are rising ♪ Serpico: If we were not to have lost Jeremy, it would have been disrespectful to the sacrifices that the armed forces, both the soldiers and their families, make. ♪ day is a-breaking ♪ ♪ in my soul ♪ These families have to shoulder this burden, and we had to show that on this show. I love you. ♪ oh, where ♪ ♪ are our dear mothers? ♪ It's just a tremendous source of pride for me. ♪ ...up to heaven a-shouting ♪ ♪ day is a-breaking ♪ ♪ in my soul ♪ Homecoming, I try to make it as special as possible. And it's months of preparation. This homecoming was huge because this is our longest deployment was nine months. So I ordered the dress, and I added the gems to it. And I just really wanted him to know how much he meant to me and that I spent a lot of time. The look on his face, it spoke volumes to me. Homecoming is when you really want to show them how much you appreciate them and just them know that they're coming back to a loving home and a happy spouse. All right, babe. This is what we've been working on. You ready? Let's have it. [ Dance music plays ] McNamara: When it was time to have fun and lighten things up... [ Laughs ] We did that together, too, because you need that. _ Smile. The '40s episode was great. It was so much fun. We had a bunch of dance lessons, all of us. I'm ready to slay on the dance floor. Brian and I practiced a lot. [ Laughs ] Brian just reminded me it was a challenge until I stopped leading. So, that was a fun episode. [ Laughter ] - Anybody want some more jasmine tea, sandwiches, scones? - Yes. I loved hanging out with the tribe - because Joan never got to do that. - [ Laughter ] We would do these formal military events, and Joan would be in her dress blues. The girls would have on these gowns, and I'd have a bun on, and it would just drive me crazy. - Yeah? - Oh, yeah. [ Chuckles ] And episode that I wish I had more to do with was the golf episode. - This is gonna be so much fun. - Mm-hmm. - That joint was so funny. - That was my favorite. Come on. How bad can it be? Oh, oh! Roxy, Roxy! Oh, no! I got'em! [ Tires screech, horn blares ] - Sorry! - I was crying. Wow, that sandbox is really hard to get out of. Well, Claudia Joy's supposed to be this expert golfer. Brown: Oh, no. And I remember... So, now all you have to do is read the line adjust. I'm trying to, like, hit the ball. Hey. Shh! And I'm taking three shots. And Sally's supporting me. She goes... I'm like, "It's okay, Kim. You got it." Yes, CJ! Whoo! I said, "This is worse than doing a love scene." "I swear to God, this is worse than doing a nude love scene." What of my more fun moments was singing the baby to sleep... - Oh, God. Yeah. - ...with the army song. Both: ♪ proud of all we have done ♪ ♪ fighting till the battle's won ♪ ♪ and the army goes drumming on ♪ Brown: When you deal with a show that has such heavy themes or whatnot, I think we did everything that we could to make it as easy-going as possible. I'm gonna try something different on this line reading. Make a plan, break it down. [ Smooches ] Davidson: I was always amazed at how you could bring levity to the set and be a real clown and an idiot. - [ Laughter ] - I really appreciate that. I have a gift, and I'm not gonna hide it under a bunch of pretenses. McNamara's pretty much the class clown. Well, I'm doing my best, sir. [ Sternly ] Why don't you learn your lines? He does things to get on the gag reel, whereas more professional people organically allow it to transpire. This good for you, John? John: Yeah, that's good. [ Laughs ] I had so many scenes with Brian. And many of these scenes were very serious. [ Laughs ] I just farted. I like to sort of stay in the moment and stay sort of serious, especially if it's a serious scene, and he would make that very difficult. Joan... I've always wanted to kiss you. [ Chuckles ] We had a lot of really wonderful, fun times. Yeah, okay. Let's go. [ Laughs ] I'm gonna miss those times. [ Chuckling ] It's really you. Every guest star that came was just fantastic. Yeah. And all of them, I think, left Charleston going, "It's kind of my favorite show I've ever been on." - Hi, mom. - Oh, I should have told you I was coming. Marsha Mason played my mom. And Margaret, she was wonderful. It's so wonderful to see you, Michael! - Ooh! - Barbara Eden. I still got it. [ Clicks tongue ] Jill Biden came down. One of the things I value most about my role as Second Lady is the opportunity to visit with military families. She was amazed how many takes we had to do. She's like, all ready with all of her Secret Service around her. Are you enjoying yourselves? - We are, yes. - Good. Delaney: General Casey and his wife. - When the White House calls... - You answer. [ Chuckling ] Exactly. - Harry Hamlin. - More champagne. He was fun. Noted and appreciated. [ Applause ] Thanks again to our special guest, Tanya Biank. Over the seasons, I had some cameo appearances. And then, in this last season, I actually got to play myself. Women with courage, confidence, and character. It was surreal because I was doing something that I would normally do in my real life. [ Rock music plays ] Brooke Shields, who played hot-shot Air Force pilot Kat Young, I asked her how did she like wearing a flight suit. And she said that she loved it. It was her favorite outfit, which was funny 'cause it's a uniform. And the Air Force does not wear flight suits that tight. [ Chuckles ] I got your attention, didn't I? _ Look at this crowd. Whoo! This joint is jumping! Yep. Pressman: The Hump Bar. You must be from Tennessee 'cause you the only 10 I see. Sweet. You can count. Just don't breed. With the peanut shells on the ground and bar fights. I'm not good enough for you, but he is? Why can't it ever happen in the parking lot? The Hump Bar was this melting pot. I am loving it that you guys were here at The Hump, especially a colonel's wife. Even Denise and Claudia Joy would, like, end up being there. It is rather conduct unbecoming of me, I know. That was Roxy's hood. The Hump Bar, I praise you, I love you, I miss you, and you will be in my heart forever. To The Hump. - Can't keep a good bar down. - Yeah. There's a saying in the military that we leave no man behind, but the truth of the matter is, is that our service members do leave people behind in order to follow the call of duty. And "Army Wives" told that story. It's awesome because it's such an experience to go different places and not know your road map and to meet so many different people and to develop great friendships and stuff like that. But it also is... it's really... It's tough. You try not to get close to people because they're gonna be gone. But it's hard to do that because you need them to get through what you're going through. So, it's, you know, you're constantly fighting with yourself because I'm not really good at goodbyes. And it's been a lot of goodbyes. [ Pool balls clacking ] _ Pamela: I've been thinking. We've all been lucky for a really long time. What do you mean? Well, this is the army. You know, sooner or later, everybody's gonna have to go somewhere else. Yeah, I try not to think about it. [ Chuckles ] Me, too. I feel like we were always saying goodbyes. Come on, you guys. What is this, a wake? - Exactly. - Roxy. - You promised not to be depressing. - I lied. It was always very difficult to understand that motto of the army that I feel like Claudia Joy always said. Well, we don't say goodbye in the army, Pamela. [ Both chuckle ] We say "See you again." See you again. Pamela leaving was the first. A Delta buddy of Chase's runs a high-tech security firm in San Jose. - I said no at first, but now... - California? It was extremely hard, personally, to say goodbye. Don't say anything. [ Sighs ] I love you. [ Sniffles ] Okay. I got to go. As Pamela, as Brigid, whatever... train wreck. I was a train wreck. What I loved was that through that whole season, we had, like, phone calls. The idea was that no matter where we were, the characters and the friends continue. Delaney: - Yes. - You know? To be continued. To be continued always. We'll all stay in touch. It won't be the same. Melvoin: By the time Roxy leaves the series, she has gone through a remarkable transformation. She began as a fish out of water, knowing nothing about the army. She became a fish out of water again as an officer's wife. What does my hemline have to do with being an FRG leader? - A lot, actually. - [ Sighs ] Things change when your husband becomes an officer, Roxy. I am so proud of where Roxy went. She never shied away from being honest and true to herself. My name is Roxy Leblanc, and I am your new FRG leader. What I loved was she just helped lead people. I think we saw that most through Gloria. Listen. The former owner of this bar took a chance on me once. Now I'm gonna do the same for you. Really? You think I can do it? - I know you can do it. - [ Chuckles ] Trevor: My orders came in. I've been assigned Second Ranger Battalion at Fort Lewis. We report to Tacoma in 30 days. We can do that. She's in a really terrific place. I think people can feel that she's going off to a really bright and happy future. Four boys, one dog, 3,000 miles. You ready? Yeah, but can we take the long way out? Absolutely. [ Doorbell rings ] Michael? Claudia Joy... she's gone. Losing somebody as important to the show as Claudia Joy was a huge challenge for us. There was still so much she wanted to do. She never had any regrets. Don't even doubt that. I still can't believe she's gone. Boy, was she the ground that he stood on. And the loss of her, you know, rocked him. [ Crying ] It's so strange to be here without mom. She's never gonna be here again. [ Sobs ] Michael: You are the people who meant the most to Claudia Joy. She wrote this the night before her kidney surgery, just in case. The memorial service for Claudia Joy, the emotion that was there... "I'm not gonna say don't be sad. Just don't feel sad too long." And that's a testament to what terrific actors we had and how well they knew their characters and how Claudia Joy's death impacted each one of them. It was one of the more magical experiences of my acting career. [ Crying ] Goodbye, mom. [ Sobs ] _ Melvoin: Losing a character like Claudia Joy was a huge challenge, but it gave us the opportunity to work more with General Holden, with Brian's character, to see how you deal with the loss of somebody who was your life's partner and how do you pick up the pieces after that, which then led to the introduction of Brooke Shields. How are you settling in? Charleston's been extremely welcoming, sir. In a way like Claudia Joy, every bit his equal. And that's what Michael needs and looks for and admires. Maybe next time, you could let me know before you jump a plane to hell and gone. Is that a professional request, sir? No, Colonel. It isn't. I thought the writers handled it tastefully and took as much time as was allowed. Neither of us was looking for this. And now that it's here, we're gonna see where it might lead. With full respect to Claudia Joy. I like to think Brooke's character and Michael developed another really beautiful relationship. After the death of Claudia Joy, Denise inherits the mantle of Claudia Joy's leadership. You tell me, Denise. What would Claudia Joy do in your shoes? Claudia Joy would push the envelope when necessary. So, you see a woman really grow in terms of her sense of who she is, where she stands in the world, what she's capable of doing. And by the end of the series, she really is now the new leader of the tribe. And you see the younger women that have come in to the show looking up to her in the same way, going back seven years, that those young women looked up to Claudia Joy. What's the matter? I hate tea. So why'd you take it? When the Brigade Commander's wife offers you tea, you take the tea. For a show to continue on the air, you have to introduce new faces. In my father's army, the ranks never mixed, and that's how I always looked at things. But you bailed me out without giving it a second thought. All we saw was an army wife in trouble. That's right. So, we had begun to introduce characters... Jackie, Kelli Williams' character, and her husband, and also Gloria. Hey, honey. Where's our beers? Are you talking to me? 'Cause I could tell you what you can do with your beers if you don't take that meat hook off me, honey. We're very excited about the choices that we made and the new cast that came in. But I think it's a testament to how wonderful the original cast was that people were very reluctant to see them go, including me. It's just us now, Roland. Thank God we have each other, right? - Roland? - I'm moving. - What? - Now, it's only temporary. I've been asked to participate in a clinical study at Johns Hopkins. My paper I wrote's been getting a lot of attention. That's fantastic. Brown: I like to think now that Joan has reached the level in her career that she has, and Roland has this wonderful opportunity, I think they're in a great space. There are so many people I need to thank today. Davis: The series ends on Joan's retirement, which, you know, is really interesting because Joan's entire life was all about making it to General. It is my fondest hope as I leave this my that love so much that other women will take up the standard I leave behind today and carry it to even greater heights. Melvoin: There's a great deal of wishfulness and sadness about saying goodbye to some of these characters. But I know, for me, the characters live on. [ Applause ] I am the biggest, biggest "Army Wives" fan ever. I'm a super fan. I always will be a fan. I own all the seasons. My husband got them for me for Christmas. No matter where I lived, where I was stationed, I could look forward to sitting down on the sofa on Sunday night, turning it on, and seeing those familiar faces and those storylines that I could relate to. I was very, very sad to see it end, but I'm very grateful for what I think it did for the military families and the spotlight that it gave us. I'm gonna miss the show. I don't know what I would do if it wasn't around. I'm so sad it's going away. [ Sniffles ] _ Any time a show runs for as long as ours did, you're always gonna have this sense of mourning when it comes to an end because week in and week out for seven years, you were experiencing their stories in your home. - Yeah. - Sure. - I think it left a void in a lot of our viewers, and they took it so personally. - Yeah. - You know? And we take it personally, too. I think it's just one of those things that you move on. Life goes on. It's like we stole a couple years together as a tribe, as a family. I still can't believe he's going. I thought I'd be used to it by now. Well, we never get used to it. We just get through it. You will, too. Right. I know it's left kind of a hole in our audience's heart, and I am so appreciative of that, that they feel that strongly about the show. I just hope that everybody knows, it really... it means as much to us as it does to them. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Biank: I think the series has served as a cultural ambassador for the US military because it has shown the human side of our soldiers. And that's a side that you don't always get to see on the nightly news. Serpico: I don't think that can be understated, the debt that we as a country, I think, owe to our armed forces. We ask them to do this for us. And I think "Army Wives" was a way of saying, "We appreciate it, thank you." [ Both laugh ] Biank: The bedrock of the show was love of family, love of friends, love of country. And I think really that's what resonated so much with our audience. [ Crying ] It all went by so fast. [ Crying ] Serpico: It was not something that happens often, that you have something that really means something to a lot of people, that they can attach their hearts to and feel like they're a part of. [ Voice breaking ] Thanks for... [Sniffles] being part of the journey. Feels like we've been through so many lifetimes together, doesn't it? Yes, it does. It's amazing, huh? Moving around the world, seeing fascinating places. God, all the adventures. [ Sniffles ] Making wonderful friends.

Whoever this First Risen is, we want to find them before anyone else does. Just standing there, nobody else around. No-one else? Are you sure? I've found the First Risen. You should see him. He's beautiful. Good to see you again, brother. - You're certain he's the one? - I am. He spoke of his redemption from the earth clear and true, others bore witness. And there's something incredibly special about him, Julian. He's everything the Prophet said the First Risen would be and so much more. I'm proud of you, Simon. You found him. - And the Prophet? - He's proud of you too. Sit. He has a message for you. Simon, my son, my 12th disciple, I've chosen you to change history. You were in bondage when we first met, I set you free. Now you must do the same for all our species. You must sacrifice the First Risen on the 12th hour of the 12th day of the 12th month. The First Risen must be destroyed, only then can the Second Resurrection occur. It has to be done, Simon for the greater good. Yeah. Good luck. The brochures promised a PDS-free environment. Well, I'm very sorry but what do you expect... Here's what I'm talking about. Them lot walking around, barefaced, it's not on. Do we have a problem? Do... we... have a problem? No. No, we don't. Dropped your bag, mate. Some people, eh? You must sacrifice the First Risen. The First Risen must be destroyed. ... must be destroyed. That's 50 millilitres. Up the dose. Another ten won't make any difference. It's not working, John. It's stable, Victor. Just because we want to believe that... It's stable, Victor. The subject is unresponsive, just like all the rest of them. We can't delude ourselves any longer. Where am I? Hold up! Can I help? - You've got one, haven't you? - I beg your pardon? You've an Undead in there, correct? I have a son with Partially Deceased Syndrome. Then you're at risk. That Freddie Preston stopped taking his medication and went completely rabid, almost murdered his own wife. If your son goes wild and you haven't taken the proper precautions, it's on your head. - Steve? - Huh? Are you all right? No. No, not really, Sue, I'm not. I just keep thinking about what Kier said he did. Well, we all took extreme measures during the Rising, - didn't we, Steve? - Yeah, I know, but we were defending ourselves. It turns out we were defending ourselves from people like him. He didn't know what he was doing! He takes his medication every day, doesn't he? Yes, at one time he was unbalanced. But... he's back to normal now. - What's going on, son? - Nothing, Dad. I can't look at him when he's like that! Kieren Walker... - ... you're under arrest. - Arrest? GP's were broke into yesterday, rabids were let loose. They attacked the receptionist, she's in hospital. Jesus! I didn't break in to the GP's surgery. It's not me who needs convincing. Come on. - Hey, hey, where are you taking him? - Parish council want to question him. - You can't just drag him off like this. - Sue! Orders from Miss Martin. I've got to bring him in. - Mum? Dad? - Are you just going to stand there? What can I do? What she says goes. Hello? Can you just give me a second, please? I am trying... You're fine. You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine. You're listening to Roar FM, coming to you from down the valley. First topic of the day is, of course, Hard Graft. - Oh, no, no, no. - Now we... - What's wrong, Ms Martin? - I'm all right. Let's get you a cup of tea. Parents can be the living end. I don't speak to my father very often, but when I do, it's complicated. I don't like talking to mine neither. They're always jabbering on and on, can never get a word in edgeways and I'm lucky if I get to speak to my brother once in a blue moon. - I have a brother. - Do you? Older or younger? Younger. He's very dear to me. They're never around when you need them most, though, are they? - Where's his accomplice? - Looked all over for him. There's no sign. Ms Martin was very insistent that they were tried together. What can we do if he's scarpered? All right. - Let's hear it from you, then. - Hear what? The confession. - Nothing to confess. - Rubbish. You and that Irish one broke into the GP's and let loose rabids - that mauled the receptionist. - That's not true. It saddens me that you've been so led astray, Kieren. You and your accomplice were seen coming out of the GP's after the mauling. Me and Simon worked together at the GP's a couple of days ago and we haven't been back since. Did you enjoy your time at the treatment centre? Cos that's where you're headed if you don't confess. - You can't send me back to Norfolk! - Want to bet? "If a PDS sufferer is suspected of breaching their terms of release, they must be reported to the Department of Partially Deceased Affairs, whereupon the non-compliant patient will be detained for their own safety and the safety of others." I haven't breached my terms of release. "PDS patients who pose a threat to themselves or members of their community are considered dangerous and the proper authorities should be notified." You and your accomplice have been deemed a threat to your community. - I'm not a threat to the community. - Are you the community? Yes, I am the... I don't understand the question. It's simple. I'm asking you, are you the community? - No. - That's right, you're not. We are the community and we have deemed you a threat to it. Now, admit your guilt and we'll hand you a suspended sentence. If not it's off to Norfolk you go. All right. What about Simon? Once he's found, he's being packed off. Now... confess your crimes. I didn't do it! - Good Lord! - Ow! What a monster! You're not going to be like this for ever. - John... - You wanted to see how he'd react. He's reacting. Everyone happy with the test subject's emotional response? We have you on a drug a new drug we've synthesised here. It's making you more hu... It's making all of you more like you used to be. It might even stop the war. There's a cure? With your help, there could be. You were the first to respond to the chemical compound. That's very promising. What do I have to do? Allow us to continue experimenting on you. Ok. Does my family know what happened to me? I don't want them to see me like this... No, I... I promise they won't. ... until I'm fixed. Until you're fixed. Ok. We're going to stimulate the parts of your brain that have reacted to the drug. Get some readings. Is all this necessary, John? It is, Simon. All part of the healing process. Starting the procedure... now. Steady, Victor. The current is too high. He's going into seizure. - Cut the power. - I can't. Dr Halperin? Dr Weston? John? Can anyone hear me? Hello! You were the first and the last. You are the one that liveth and was dead, and behold, you are alive for evermore. - Who's that? - You're what's meant to be. What's happening? What's happening? They're lying to you, Simon, they're lying to you. They'll say anything to survive. Don't trust them. Just a power surge, Simon. You're all right. You're all right, you're all right, you're all right. I must be losing my mind. What's wrong with you? Same thing that's wrong with you. Why did you allow yourself to be treated like a puppet? John and Victor are helping me get better. - You believe that? - It's the truth. Better from what? We're not infected and we're not sick. The person who pulled the curtain on me all they were trying to do was survive a little bit longer. That's the driving force at the core of every human being. Forget morality and ethics and all the other bullshit they say they're striving for. The living just care about surviving as long as humanly possible. It's a pitiful pitiful, desperate existence. We're better than that. We're free. We are the first and the last, and behold, we are alive for evermore. You heard him too? Believe him, Simon. Don't touch them! This is my place. I can touch anything I want. Amy! Amy! - You sure you're all right? - Yeah. I'm fine. Just, um, took some sheep's brains last night to loosen up, bad hangover. Should be in chains! They're animals, they're all animals. Never trust a rotter! Get back in your graves! - You bringing your weapon tomorrow, then? - Beating The Bounds? Oh, aye. Are you? With those wild beasts still out and about, abso-bloody-lutely! I didn't do it, Dad. I've been falsely accused. For Christ's sake, Steve... they're threatening to send him back to Norfolk. Right, so you should sign the confession and have done with it. - Go along to get along, son. - No, no. I'm not confessing to something I didn't do. You were pressured into it. We all do daft things to join the in crowd. Bloody hell, I've done my fair share of rebelling... knock-a-door-runs all over the place. Did Simon put you up to it, love? No, Mum, he didn't. Cor! You're supposed to be my family, have my back, no matter what. I expect it from them, - but to be put on trial by my own family? - Whoa! Let's call a clock out here. I've got to get on those decorations for the fete. I'm late for work. I was hoping you could stop in. - How can I, Steve? - All right, all right. Have you calmed down now? You'll behave, won't you, if we leave you here on your tod? - You're listening to Roar FM. We've got Trevor on the line. Hi, Trevor. - How do, Dave? - What's your PDS point of view? Well, I'm concerned. There's a piece in paper today about these PDS sufferers becoming tolerant to their medications. - Scary stuff, Trev. - Terrifying. I wouldn't be surprised. I trust the scientists as much as I trust the Government. Me mother's migraine pills stopped working. Hey. So, what are you up to, then? I'm, um just doing a spot of DIY. Wow. The excitement never stops in the Wilson household! Going on a day trip. Was wondering if you wanted to accompany me. What about the travel ban? Where do you think we're going, Timbuktu? Where are we going? Somewhere crazy. - Have you never played crazy golf before? - No, first time. You're a putting natural! - Maybe I'm just lucky today. - Whoa, there, Tiger. Crazy golf is a game of skill. Wouldn't be an Olympic sport if it wasn't. I'm not sure it is an Olympic sport. - Why not? - Don't know. Maybe because it's called "crazy golf." Table tennis is called Ping-Pong, and that's an Olympic sport. Perhaps if the crazy golf people got together and came up with a more serious-sounding name, like elaborate obstacle golf, you see then... then the Olympic body might make it a proper sport. It is a proper sport. I don't care what the gods of Olympus say. Stupid gods. Are you ok? It's ok. I don't feel anything. Don't feel the cold. Can you feel that? Can't feel a bloody thing. I'm sorry. It's ok. I forget meself. What's the rush? - What? - You're really good at this, and if you take that shot then you're going to win... and the game's over. Isn't that the point? The point of a game is to keep on playing. Well, yeah, maybe. But if we don't finish it, it sort of becomes pointless, doesn't it? Tell you what, Tiger. You get another hole-in-one, you get a kiss from the loser. That would be me. Focus, Phil, focus. I wanted it too much. Summat's brewing, no doubt, Miss Martin. I tailed him, like you asked. He crept into city, met this other dodgy-looking rotter at an hotel. I lifted them off him. Good work, Captain. Did you read this? Thought you'd want to first, chain of command and all that. What do you reckon? Looks suspicious, all right. - Do you think he's planning an attack? - Could be. At this juncture, nothing should be ruled out. Fucking hell. Miss Martin, you say the word and that rotter is as good as gone. I swear down I will plant that bastard six feet under. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'll look at the evidence and assess the immediate threat. Until then, you keep your eyes and ears to the ground. And, Captain, let's keep all of this classified. You must sacrifice the First Risen on the 12th hour of the 12th day of the 12th month. The First Risen must be destroyed. Only then can the Second Resurrection occur. - It's time. - John, you said... Progress has been... - slower than expected. - Slow? Nothing's changed. I'm still like this. That's why we've provided you with contact lenses and the foundation. You promised they wouldn't see me like this. You promised. As part of the programme, all patients must complete this exercise. It's out of my hands. John... John, please! Dr Penrose to block C. Dr Penrose to block C. John! Giles Weir, Minister for... So, you're the one they've sent to keep us in line? That makes me sound like kind of a killjoy school matron. No, no, doctor. Think of me as a... a patron of the grand sciences, if you will. Huge fan of your work. Your chemical compound has brought the war to a full stop. Well done. - You say you're injecting them now? - Every day. It's quite a simple procedure. It could be done at home. - Really? - They're not ready. What's that? They aren't ready to go back into society. What my colleague is trying to say... For all intents and purposes, they are reanimated corpses. And if they miss a dose of the drug, they revert back to their rabid state. They're not cured. We can't cure what they have. And what do they have, Doctor? They have a very unique set of symptoms. At a push, you could call it a syndrome. But, honestly, that only scratches the surface. They're not of this world, but, partially, they are. In a lot of ways, they're a superior species. So they're sort of... partially dead? I wouldn't use the word "dead." Well, deceased, then. They're partially deceased. Oh, I like the sound of that, don't you? Sounds manageable. We've only got 15 minutes. Hi, Dad. You can speak? The doctors didn't didn't say you'd be able to do that. They keep me in the dark, too. What's that? The doctors here, they keep things from me, too. Right. Where's Mum? Where is she? You don't remember? Remember? You came home... What? That night. What did I do? - I can't do this. - Dad... Dad! Dad, what did I do to her? He's not turning rabid, he's just upset. He's had some bad news. Bad news? He killed his mother in his untreated state. Oh, dear. Shocking, what they're capable of. Where's Simon? I don't want to do this any more. You hear me? I don't want to do this any more. Please. Hello? Is someone there? Do you see now? The living have nothing to offer you but lies. They're desperate men with desperate schemes and you do not belong with them. You belong with your own kind. Only then will you find salvation. Only then will you find peace. Simon? Christ. - What are you doing? - Looking for Simon. Have you seen him? - Uh-uh. - If the patrols catch him, they're going to take him back to the treatment centre. What's wrong? Love the new look you're rocking. Very handsome, handsome. Does he like it? How do I look? - Moregeous. - You have to say that... you're my BDFF. Best dead friend forever. Look, Amy, um, about me and Simon... It's ok. Sorry, Amy. We'll talk later. - I'm under house arrest. - House arrest? God... - This place is going to hell. - You're telling me! - Kieren Walker? - Yeah? Nothing. Take care. I mean it. Your belongings. Ready? Dad. Um... I haven't got anything in for dinner. I could go and get us something, I suppose. - Fish and chips? - Aye. Aye, all right. Where should I... ? - How's the fish? - It's good. Thanks, Dad. This haddock's a bit tough. Our usual place during the Rising... Well, it's not there any more, so... I had to go someplace else. "Since you were gone, my barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone... " Dad? What happened to Mum... - I didn't mean to... - All right. I just... - I just want to say that I'm... - I said all right, Simon. Yeah... Dad? What's going on? You don't deserve to look at her. I want you out of this house. Get out! Where the hell have you been? I was just about to let Dean know you'd gone. If he'd have done that, Kieren... I had to go out, Mum. Where did you go? Can you at least not lie about that? Mum! I went to look for Simon. It's happening all over again, Sue. Someone puts a spell on him and it ends in disaster. Mum, can you tell him I'm not under anyone's spell? How can we ever trust you again, Kier? You can start by not siding with the mob, Dad. I'm just concerned for this family's safety. You're scared of me? I am. I'll admit it. When you're acting like this. Acting like what? I don't even recognise you any more. This is who I am. Jesus Christ! - Amy? - In here. I got your message. Thanks for coming. You know you've got a tear at the top of your tent? Small potatoes in the grand scheme of things. Was I supposed to bring a sleeping bag? During the Rising did you ever kill a rabid? During the Rising, I was more a back office sort of bloke. It's ok if you did. Actually, it's better if you did. No, I never killed anyone. Not even a sort of... mercy killing? No. Why? Put them on me. Pick up the screwdriver. Not until you tell me what's going on. Um... I'm... I'm... I'm currently at Terminal 5. I've got my suitcase packed, I'm in the departure lounge, I just need to get on the plane. Do you understand? No. I've become immune to the medication, Philip, the drugs aren't working any more. And not long from now, I'm going to go rabid, and there's no chemicals out there that can turn me back. I don't want to live as a rabid, going around hurting people without a thought in my head. It's no kind of life. I'll call Dr Russo. It's no good. Once I turn, I turn for good and then I'm stuck. Stuck like that for ever. It's a fate worse than death. That's me when she said you were here. - No, she told it true. - So I see. Tell me you didn't, uh, trek all the way up to beautiful Buffalo to ask to be my lieutenant governor. You know, see, I need diversity down the ticket, you know? Oh, don't sell our potential ticket short. Come on. We have so many areas of commonality. Gun control, healthcare. Everything but family values. What do you mean? Well, I was thinking about your son. - The gay one. You really think people have a problem with that - in this day and age? - No, I think you do. Which is why you sent him to that religious boot camp when he was 17... to pray the gay away. Boy, the letters that poor kid sent to his friends. You sling innuendo like that without evidence, you're gonna look like... "They said we sexualized masculine connection" because we didn't have enough healthy, non-sexual connection with our fathers. So they made me sit shoulder-by-shoulder with another kid and then put our arms around each other. They called it 'healing touch, ' though, of course, all I could think about "was kissing his shoulder." Enough. There was a sympathetic counselor. He made copies, smuggled them out. - I can read more if you'd like. - Don't. I see the wheels turning. I see you trying to figure out how to triage this one. Well, what about the political confessional? You can stare into the camera and deliver your mea culpa. It would work, only you would need to start out with name recognition. So I guess you have a choice. This can be the way the people of New York finally learn your name for forcing your son straight in the name of the Lord. "Healing touch" should play great in the five boroughs. Or you can step aside and explain that you have looked at the future, and where we're going, "We need Rhoades." You think this is how this is gonna go? I will see you in the primaries, Chuck. Looking forward to it. A Hell in a Cell poster? Autographed by Taker and Mankind? ! - Ben, did you get me this? - What? I know it wasn't you. Everything after Sanmartino/Zbyszko is bullshit. Okay, you just called the Macho Man bullshit. What was Stan Stasiak and his heart punch? Actually, I got it. Oh. Uh, thanks. It's got a "Brokeback" sort of charm. "I just can't quit you." Yes? Yeah, I know where that is. I'll be there. That was Foley. Just invited me to his house. For the party? No. This just arrived. Hand-engraved. There are so many things that we have gotten relaxed about. Running out ground balls to first. Knowing a martini means gin. Isn't it nice that someone is maintaining standards? What do you think it means? That he appreciates your aggression. Or he's furious that you assassinated an ally. Assassinated? Sweeney quit. Out of the race before it even began, on the heels of your visit. Come on. Let's go pick out some tails. Can someone take care of my car? Valet's not open yet. Shit. Danny. Danny Margolis. Anyway, uh, I'm not a valet. I started as a valet. Worked my way up to waiter. Barback's just around the corner, so... Heh. Heard you ended up doing time. Didn't make me happy. Yeah, paid my debt, all that. Hey, uh, Axe, if you can use somebody to analyze companies or bring you ideas, you know... You know, I always liked you, Danny. But you did the one thing no one can ever come back from. I'm honored that the Restore the Eastern Timber Wolf Conservancy has seen fit to name me its man of the year, but I'm also a little surprised, since I didn't, well, until this morning, actually know what an eastern timber wolf looked like. Kind of mangy. I understand it's the coyote blood. Terrific organization, though. Wouldn't you agree? Haven't a clue. Hell of a gambit, hmm? If this was just a little row between the two of us, we'd shake hands, I'd take that stupid award, and you'd have nothing more to fear. So, are we shaking hands? Humbled as I am to have been singled out, I must decline. Do I need to call those wolf people back, or...? I'll take care of it. So, you got what you came for. You now know... That you weren't trying to fuck me over out of some personal animus. Someone asked you a favor, and you wouldn't want that same person to see us cozy together on the dais. Would you mind telling me who? Inelegant of you to even ask. Because it forces me to say that the Location Board combs through many factors. Sandicot submitted a proposal and was under consideration, as were many other locations. Ultimately... The committee chose the location that would bring the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. Yes, I know the party line. You could have written something more stylish. It's not supposed to be stylish. It's supposed to make you feel a little bit ill, like an out-of-season oyster. You got into this room, Mr. Axelrod, because I appreciated the, uh, fluidity of your tactics. Thank you. But our relationship ends right there. If we'd come together some other way, I'd feel certain we might have been something like friends, but that can never happen now, despite the rareness of your gifts. I hold to a code of loyalty, which may very well be outmoded, but has served me well. And to be honest, I like the way it makes me feel when I choose sides. Well, that's something I can understand. Understand this, too, then. I know you're not satisfied with what you've learned. Your search will continue, and it may take you down a great number of paths. But don't come back down this one. There's nothing for you here. Now, if you'll excuse me... Yeah, sure. Ahh, you have to get ready for your thing. A last question, if you'll indulge me. Mm-hmm. Do you like parties? Oh, I fucking love 'em. Hey, Margolis. Turns out I do have something for you after all. That's great. Should I stop by the office? You're not walking through that door ever again. This isn't a fresh start. I have to use you for what you are now, Danny. But if you come through for me, I'll pay off your house. Oh, thank you for switching nights with me. It has all been really last-minute. Yeah, I know. If you think my dinner suit was trying too hard, this must look ridiculous. No, no, I wasn't... I've been thinking about our fight. Which one? After you used Kevin as a photo op. Ah. It was a mistake. Yes, I know. You told me. Hence the fight. No, what I said when I was angry, that, that was the bigger mistake. I was closing off, and boundaries are one thing, but we shouldn't be encouraging each other not to share things. Honesty is essential if we're gonna figure this out, whether we're finding our way back to each other or... I've been regretting the same conversation myself. I didn't mean what I said about seeing other people. I twisted your words to get us there because I was feeling defensive, and, uh, I suppose, guilty. I went on a date, I think. No, it was a date. A woman from jiu-jitsu. Nothing really happened. A kiss. I stopped it there because whatever our declared status, in my heart, it felt like adultery. It's okay. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. I hijacked the conversation. No, no, I, um... I feel like I should volunteer something, too, in the spirit of honesty. Oh. You have something like that? Yeah. Yeah, I have something to admit. You don't look ridiculous. You look fuckin' hot. Hello? It's Wendy Rhoades. I'm sorry to call so late, but I figured - you'd still be at the office. - I am. That first question you asked. Are your feelings about Mafee helpful? More than any stock you'll ever champion, more than any time you'll impress somebody by being right. You haven't noticed yet. By the time anyone notices, it's usually too late, but that place has a way of obscuring, corroding, eating you from the fucking inside. And you have a rare chance to survive. You're so far ahead of where Axe and I were when we were your age. We hadn't made hard choices. You know yourself better. And your feelings are a lifeline connecting you back to that place, screaming at you from your core, "Don't forget me. Don't forget. I don't like to lie." I don't. If you start to feel yourself not feeling, do what you did the other day and come find me... before it's too late... for both of us. I have to go. - This is how you do it. - Uh-huh. He's got piss all over his big boy's. I'm just gonna play one. Uh, maybe two. Foley doesn't fuck around. That's Ben Folds. No, even when he fucks around, he means business. - Mr. Rhoades. - Yes. Mr. Foley would like to see you in the library. Your father's been telling me about you since you were in knickerbockers. Don't think I ever wore those. No, he showed me the pictures. Must have been you. He'd never go around with photos of the bastards. He's put a lot of time into you. My own children didn't have the drive. Maybe I spoiled them too much. Had to find other prospects. But by this point, it's a pretty deep farm system. I've been drafting blue-chippers, high upsides, and reclamations for three decades. So why should I sign you off the street? Oh, I think you're confused. I'm not trying to sell myself to you. You didn't just put Sweeney out of the race. You crushed his spirit. No reason to do that unless you wanted to tell me something about you. Maybe I just couldn't help myself. Or maybe I knew you were dangling him to see what I would do. Whatever's meant to happen always does. I had a gut feeling. That's how I do this. That's how I do all of it. Mm. So, what's the trick? The trick? Hmm. Well, like most, it's bracingly simple. You pick the right man, and then you get him the fuck out of his own way so people can actually see him. Elections aren't about ideas. Elections are about candidates. Mm. And candidates are about what's in here. I am the right man. I am not going to ask you. You can't think it works that way. Jack. Will you make me governor? Yeah. Okay. My friends will become your friends, and your enemies will become mine, as some already have. Uh, about that clerkship, you can put that - out of your mind. - Well, thank you. I'm sure my granddaughter has put it out of hers. It's not really over. There are other judges more senior and prestigious. I will deliver you that clerkship. Whatever's meant to happen always does. I know. I know. It's starting to feel real. Heavy lies the head that... The hesitation is still about Axelrod. Yes. Ah. You know the joke about the two bulls on top of the hill and the cows down below? The young bull wants to run down and fuck one. And the old bull says, "Let's walk on down and fuck 'em all." That has been repeated so many times in movies, TV shows. It's taken as received wisdom, except the thing is you can't. Nobody gets to fuck 'em all. You got to choose which one you're gonna fuck, and then... fuck her good. Son of a bitch. Welcome to the Yale Club. Hey. Excuse me. Are you a member? Do I look like a fucking member? - We have a dress code. - Good for you. And she stepped on the billiard ball! Rhoades! Rhoades! You fucking weasel! But you're my protector. You'll always take good care of me. I've always protected you. I always will. (erratic and suspenseful music) Wake and bake, man. Help! You've got to help me. Dude! You're in your underwear man. You got to help me. Those people are bat shit! They still have my friend. They're crazy! They drugged me! Look man, just calm down man. Have a smoke. I'm serious. We got go. Where is your car? What car, man. I hike these woods. We gotta go. You're not safe either. They're coming. It's cool brother. I know these woods, man. We're all right. I'm out of here. Those people are crazy. Well look, alright man, I just can't let you go traipsing around like that. I'll take you back to your cabin, alright? Just let me get my shoes. Hurry. (low, suspenseful music) You're on my property. No. No man. It's cool. I said, you're on my property boy. (bones crack) (hiker screams in pain) I can't stand you hippy types. (hiker moans and grunts in pain) You sons of bitches think you own the whole God damn world! This is my property! You hear? My Property! (suspenseful and thrilling electronic music) (loud thumps) (Jack grunts in pain) (knife shanks flesh) (Jack screams in pain) Well now city boy that oughta keep your ass from running off. You've seen what I did to that hippie piece of shit. I'm gonna do the same thing to you. But it's your lucky day, son! You're gonna get to play with Momma and me first! (knife slices flesh) (Jack grunts in pain) Please just let me go! I don't get it, city boy. We watched and that pretty young thing bumping uglies all day yesterday. What we got in mind, well, it ain't so much different. Me and Momma, we like the same things you do. Only we take it just a little bit further. Fact is, we're gonna open your eyes up to things you ain't never considered before. (jack moans and grunts in pain) But don't pay it no never mind. You ain't going to last too long anyway, pretty boys like you never do. Suppose we best be getting back to the house before Momma gets madder. Come on boy, we're going to have us some fun. (suspenseful and thrilling music) (loud thumping) (Jack grunts) (loud thumping) (soft and ominous music) (jack screams in pain) (door creaks closed) You crazy fuck. Stay the hell away from me. You don't need that with me. [Jack] The hell I don't. I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to help you. Then get the fuck out of my way. Wait! My parents, this land has been in our family for years. There are traps and lures all over. You won't ever make it. No one does. You mean, all these people? You won't make it out of here without me. I know the woods just as well as they do, maybe better. I can get you to the Sheriff. Why would you help me? They're monsters! No one knows that better than me. Then why are you still here then? I don't have anywhere else to go. (low and ominous music) You can get me out of here? Yes. What do you want in return? Take me with you, take me to the city. Wherever you go. I'm nothing like them. Please. You need me just as much as I need you. Okay. You promise? You promise you'll take me with you? Lady, if you get me out of here, I'll take you to London, Paris, anywhere you want to go. I knew it. I knew it when I saw you yesterday that you would be the one. We need to hurry. Yeah we should. Well let's get going. They could be here any minute. We should go. Mmm, baby. We need to, they could be here any minute. You need to calm down. Calm down? [Jack] We need to focus on getting back to town. That's all you care about isn't it? At the moment? Yeah, that pretty much covers it. What about me? Were you just using me? What? You promised. You promised we would be together. How could you lie to me like that? Keep your voice down. You're a liar. You're a liar! (Mumbles) (sudden smack) (Jack grunts in pain) (erratic and suspenseful electronic music) Please. Baby please. Come back. Please. You said we'd be together forever. Please come back. Please. I'm going to fucking kill you, city boy. Please. Where are you? We'd be together forever. Forever! Come back! Come back! Baby, please! We're supposed to be together. Supposed to be together. Supposed to be together. You promised that we'd be together. I'm gonna fucking hurt you, I'll gut you like a fucking fish with this machete I got. I'm gonna fucking kill you, city boy. I got you right where I want you in these woods. (thrilling and suspenseful electronic music) (loud thuds) You're so beautiful. (low grunting) (knife slices flesh) Why did this happen? You were supposed to love me. We were supposed to go away together. You must love me. (Jack pants) (intense, oscillating tone) Love me. (erratic and ominous electronic music) You see, electricity is like anything else, (phone rings) if you never really had it, you don't really miss it. Sheriff's office, go for Sheriff Westin. Thank God. You've gotta help me. I meet you yesterday at the grocery store. I'm at Myers Rentals. You gotta help. These people are crazy. They're trying to kill me. They're murderers. They've killed other people. They have the girl that I... Now slow down, slow down, slow down, just a minute there. You're the couple I met at the general store yesterday, right? Yes. They're fucking crazy. They disabled my car. You got to help me. Send a team, SWAT, whatever. You got to come quick. Welp. I'm currently the only one in the office right now so. Jesus. I've gotta get out of here now. Okay, listen, listen. I can be there in about 10 minutes, alright.? You just sit tight there in that cabin and we'll get this all sorted out. No no! I can't stay here. How do I get to the highway? I'll meet you there? Okay. Sure, sure, I can meet you there. I can meet you there. I mean, I got some bad news though, the fastest way's there is through them woods. There is a path, if I remember correctly, that oughta follow out to highway 63. Put you out around mile marker 118. I can be there in about 10 minutes. I know the path. I'm leaving now. Hurry. (thrilling electronic music) Fuck! No! God dammit! God dammit! Why'd you have to go over there? Didn't I tell you not to go over there? You're daddy's little girl. I'm gonna skin that boy alive. You hear? You will always be daddy's little girl. I'll get you a new one. I don't want a new one. I want this one. Remember that old one you had? Annie? Yes, Annie. And you were so sad when Annie died. And then we got Caitlin and you became so happy? We'll get you a new one. Pick her up. Let's go. (soft rustling) (suspenseful electronic music) Ah fuck. (Jack screams) (suspenseful electronic music) What the fuck? Sheriff! I need your help. (grunts) I need your help! Calm down, calm down. You're okay now. You're safe now. You're safe. Come on, have a seat. Here you go. Drink some water. Thank you. You alright? Pretty nasty cut you got there. Might wanna get you some medical attention. No, I'm fine. Kristy. They still have her. Kristy? You mean that beautiful thing you were with earlier? [Jack] They still got her. Okay, well calm down. Everything's going to be alright. We need to go back. We gotta go back. Okay. Calm down. Everything's going to be alright. I need to call this in. Hang tight. This is sheriff Weston with disturbance out of highway 63, over. [Dispatcher] Copy that sheriff. Over. Looks like I'm going to need backup over here. I got a possible assault, a rape, murder, and God knows what else. [Dispatcher] Copy that. So you got him? Over. Yeah I got him Momma. (low, suspenseful music) I'm bringin' him in to ya. Whoa, whoa where you're goin' son? Please don't do this. Ain't no use in begging son. You did a very bad thing and now you get to pay the price. (fist smacks face) You ain't gonna hit me with no rock. Stupid ass Jesse. Never was the smartest. Huh? (low thud) (Jack screams in pain) [Jack] Please stop! Yeah, yeah, that ain't nothin' compared to what Momma gonna do to you. So you wanna fuck with her family, huh? (Jack screams in pain) (Tom screams mockingly) Scream all you want. Scream all you want. Can't nobody hear you out here. Okay? Ain't nobody hear you. (solid thunk) Ah come on, come on. Don't you go passing out on me now. Wake up son. Wake up. Come on. Get up. Get up. Come on get up. (knife slashes flesh) (thrilling, suspenseful music) (Tom gargles and gasps) [Momma] Are you on route? Over? I asked you are on route? Over. Answer me damn it! Your sheriff won't be taking your call. [Momma] I'm going to kill you. You hear... (soft and ominous guitar music) (moves into soft, suspenseful music) (sudden shocking tone) (woman screams) (fist smacks face) (woman grunts) (knife slices flesh) (woman screams) (thrilling and suspenseful music) Son of a bitch. You growed you a pair of brass ones, didn't you city boy? I've always had em. (men grunt) Woo wee! You fast, city boy. But it don't matter. I've had faster. You have no idea, but you have fucked with the wrong guy. Been a few like you from time to time, always talking shit. In the end, even the tough ones crumble. Surprised? (men struggle and fight) You know, I've been wondering. Why you do it? You're about to find out, city boy. Yeah, sure, okay, but really, why? I mean, is it sexy to you? Does it fill a need? Some dark void left over from your inbred childhood? I do because I like it. It feels good! You about to find out why it feels so good, city boy. I'm gonna enjoy tearing up your punk ass! (Jesse grunts in pain) Really? Because it feels good? That's your only reason? And you do it with your family! I mean, that really threw me off at first. I was really scared there for a second. I don't usually let things get out of control like that. You ain't never had control. Sure, whatever makes you feel better. Oh, I'm coming for you boy. You know, I have been doing this a long time, never come across anyone like you guys. I mean you have a real mom and pop organization going on here. See me? I've always been more of a lone wolf, you know? I was planning on killing the woman who brought me here. You what? Yeah right? Fresh air? Seclusion? I have never killed in the country before. I was thinking it would be a nice change of scenery. Give it a whole "no one can hear you scream" motif. I love your death ditch with the lime, by the way. It's a good idea, I guess. You know, I like you in a strange kind of way. Well, like is a strong word. We'll say I admire you as a colleague and a peer. I'll tell you what. (knife slices flesh) (Jesse grunts in pain) [Jesse] What the hell are you doing? If I did what I think I just did, I nicked your femoral artery. Call it a professional assessment. Eh? It's the main artery in your leg. You have about five minutes until you bleed out. Or maybe you find a way to stop the bleeding. You have got to learn to adapt if you wanna stay competitive in this field. Otherwise some young guns is just gonna come in and cannibalizing your territory. Metaphorically speaking of course. What the fuck are you talking about? You're going to want to stay pretty still. You're losing a lot of blood. You're probably feeling pretty light headed. I probably did some nerve damage too. Sorry. Now, you stay here and think about how you're going to improve your performance for next time. I'm going to go have a nice little chat with your wife. (loud thump) (intense and thrilling music) Good luck! You know, being a mother is a thankless job. You wouldn't know it yet but trust me, it's a thankless job. Oh, don't worry. Jesse's going to be back with your city boy. And then we're gonna go to a room. And we're going to have some fun. Won't that be fun? (giggles) I did everything for her. And she still got herself killed by that pretty city boy. I mean I would understand it if it was a big man like Jesse. Well I guess she would have gotten herself killed by somebody. Don't you think? (intense and suspenseful music) I'm sorry, I didn't realize rednecks had the monopoly on killing around here. Where's Jesse? Oh, he's just working some stuff out of his system. I am gonna gouge out your eyes. (loud smack) Oh good, you're awake. I was worried I did some real damage there. That would take a lot of fun out of this. Ain't this a son of a bitch? Lady, you really know how to ruin a guy's weekend, You know that? I'm so sorry I messed up your vacation. Kristy, I had big plans for her. Oh, do tell. Most girls I meet online are ready to go on a date before I even have the time to come up with a decent back story. I've never done that myself, so I don't know. Kristy, she took some convincing. Finally she agree to a date. She had this whole scheme worked out where we were going just get away from it all. You know, really get to know each other. And you know what? I liked it. I really could've used a nice getaway. Well nature can be a soothing to the soul. I was having a really good time. But you guys, man, I did not see you coming. Sorry to mess up your plans, city boy. What I was really looking forward to was just cutting loose. Really hearing them scream. Well, no point in wasting a good opportunity. (loud smack) (striking guitar chord) You punch 'em first? You gotta take it slow. You gotta make them scream. You've got a knife? Otherwise you were the one who was lecturing me about wasted opportunities. Oh yes. Yes. That's much more better. All that talking you were doing earlier. That was all right. See, that lets them know you've got plenty of time and you're in no rush. Starts making it clear they are in for a long ride. Your instincts were right. But you did one thing wrong. You know when you're talking about all that stuff? You gotta touch them. All over, in all those places they never wanna be touched in. You touch them. Remember me doing that to you? Creepy right? That shows them who has the power, who's in control. It really adds to the sense of helplessness. (moans) Yes. Yes. That's it. Yeah. You're getting off on this? Being touched by the man who killed your husband? What? Jesse? He always comes back. Not this time. (Momma giggles) That's much better. You're getting it now. It's just not about the knife, everything about you is the weapon. I know what I'm doing. I've been doing this for a long time. I've been killing longer than you've been alive. I saw the pictures in the cabin. Caitlin told me those were your victims. I've killed many more people than that. Darling, I own five cabins on this land, every cabin has a mantle just like that one. I've never met anyone like you before. Like me. (thrilling and suspenseful music) Momma? Hi baby. (men grunt) Stop! Leave daddy alone! No one knows you're here. She made all the reservations. We never met until I came over to your house. Online dating. (loud thud) Ooo wee! That is the most fun I've ever had at a gas station. We got some goodies for you. Here you go. Thanks Momma. I love these. I know you do honey, I know. And, we got one for your friend. (intense and energetic heavy metal music) Thanks Momma. (Momma laughs) Why was the gas station so fun? We got it all on video. Here, have a look. Man, what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? Come on. Come on, goddamn it! What the fuck are you doing? Just take the fucking money. Please, please! Don't! Don't! (loud smack) (fist smacks man consecutively) You don't even have to do this. You don't have to do this at all! Come on, man! Please man! You don't even have to do all. (knife shanks silently) * Just be glad you shot me when you did * 'Cause you hither had've made * Would've not been kind of you * To see her gray and all that lonely * Would've made me desire * 'Cause still on my lips and my tongue * To see a man slowly take his own life * And watch it wash away in oceans of fear * Does sinner have a name for himself * As he lies, I cry * And the world is self loathing and piss * As of right now, I'm lonely * Yes in their world * Our dear, now I'm glad you ever would show * The chills that I had * And I brought it all for you * I know that sort of fear * The bullet hole to blame * And tell it to the law * That I saw that hole * I never did * As of right now, I'm lonely * Yes in their world The Carmichael Show is taped in front of a live studio audience. What are you talking about, Maxine? Weddings are a beautiful thing. We get to pretend we accomplished something, and all we had to do was not break up. And your parents pay for the whole thing. Her parents are very rich, by the way. Okay, I like the commitment of marriage. I just think weddings are cheesy. What's wrong with going down to the courthouse and just making our lives easier? A courthouse? Do you hear this? A courthou... No, of course weddings are cheesy, but where else will my Uncle Pete get a chance - to hit on one of your nieces? - (laughs) You guys are a funny couple. Hey, I'm gonna go get us all another round. No, no, no. I'll get this one. No, stop. Are you kidding? It's your anniversary. I'm getting the drinks. (chuckles): Okay. Thank you, Jessica! Maxine, that girl wants to have sex with us. What? Jerrod, you're insane. She came over, approached us, started a conversation, laughed at everything we said for over an hour. She's getting us drunk. Like, if I were single, I would've already invited her back to my place to watch Westworld. I think it's possible for someone to be friendly without wanting sex. No, it isn't. That's all friendliness is. It's just horniness in disguise, trust me. That girl wants to sleep with us. Huh. I... find that kind of flattering. I like the idea of being the couple that people want to have sex with. Like George and Amal or... Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. What? Nobody wants to have a threesome with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell anymore. What are you talking about? Well, I think they're classy. Like Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Okay, quit naming old couples, Maxine. You're creeping me out. Look, the point is, if this is real, what are we gonna do about it? - I don't know. (giggles) - I mean... you've said in the past that you'd be open to us trying a threesome. And it's fallen in our lap on our three-year anniversary. I don't think we can get a much clearer sign from God. I mean, it is something I've fantasized about. And you're sure it's something that you still want to try? More than I want my father to live to see his grandchildren. I don't even know why we're talking about this, because you're just interpreting it all wrong. She's just a friendly person. Okay, here, she's coming back. - Don't make it weird. - I'm not gonna... Okay, here we go. - Thanks. - Oh, thank you so much, Jessica. You know, you have, like, really beautiful eyes. Oh. Thank you. You know... Jessica... if I may speak for my fiancée and I, we think your eyes are beautiful, too. Oh. Wow. Um... Hey, Jessica, you ever seen Westworld? ♪ Happy anniversary. Last night was... amazing. It was incredible, right? Every couple should have a threesome. I've never felt more in sync with you. Mm-hmm. I'm not gonna lie. Really proud of the work I did in there. I mean... it was overwhelming for a second, but it's good to know that in a fight-or-flight situation, your boy here spars with the best of them. Yeah, I feel like we can accomplish anything together now. You know, if they had group sex at corporate retreats, I bet company productivity would skyrocket. (chuckles) After last night, I think you finally passed Jay Z as the most important person in the world to me. (laughs) Yeah, no, and I was like, "Well, this is a grocery store. You're supposed to have the bags." Hey, why is she still here? Yeah, it's almost noon; it's like, how long are you supposed to stay after a threesome? It was clearly a one-night stand. Everybody knows the rules. As soon as the sun hits your face, you're supposed to get out of there like a vampire. Hey, Jessica. Good morning. Well, that was a really fun night. Oh! Oh... Oh. Okay. Hey, do you guys have an extra toothbrush? What? Uh, yeah, there should be one, uh, in the cabinet under the sink. Okay, thanks. And when I get out, we can finally watch Westworld. How long do you think she's gonna stay here? She's brushing her teeth while wearing my shirt. I think she's planning on dying here. (sighs) Okay, here's what we're gonna do. When she gets out, I'm just gonna tell her that I got an emergency text from my sister, and we have to go pick her up from her abusive boyfriend's house. Well, what if she wants to come with us? Who would want to come to that? Uh, everyone. Do you know how interesting that sounds? If someone told me they were about to go to their sister's house who'd just been abused, I'd drop all my plans and get in the car. Now, look, I'm just gonna tell her to get out. No, you can't do that. We have to come up with the right thing to say so that she leaves but she doesn't, you know, feel hurt by it. Okay, you know, I'm just gonna tell her that I forgot we already had plans. Eh. Just a heads up, your toothbrushes are medium, but most dentists actually recommend soft. It's easier on your gums. Oh, yeah, I've been meaning to get soft toothbrushes. Uh... Oh, crap! Jerrod, I forgot that we have to go get our couple's massage at the spa because it's our anniversary. Oh, what spa? Oh, it's, um... What's it called? Look, Maxine's lying to you. The truth is we only wanted to have sex with you, and we don't want to hang out anymore, so we would prefer it if you left. Cool? What? Jerrod, what the hell is your problem? I am so sorry, Jessica. We do not feel that way at all. We had an amazing time with you last night, and no one's telling you to leave. Nah. She's just saying that. We really would like for you to leave. Cool? Wow. Um, I'm sorry I overstayed my welcome. No, don't be so hard on yourself. We're new to threesomes, too, you know? We're just figuring out all these crazy rules as we go along, you know? (scoffs) Okay. Yeah, I guess I'll leave. Westworld time! Jerrod, how can you be so inconsiderate? She was so hurt. No, she seemed fine. Okay, how would you feel if you had sex with someone and then they kicked you out first thing in the morning? Amazing. Maxine, honesty is way better than stringing someone along. We kicked her out early enough for her to still enjoy the rest of her day. What is it, like, noon? She could still catch a matinée if she wants to, and those are half off tickets. We're saving this girl time and money. Oh, don't act like you did something noble. Nobody likes that kind of brutal honesty. Lying after sex is just common human decency. Okay. Maxine, let's not fight about her, okay? If there's a lesson to be learned here, it's that we are just way too much fun as a couple. People are gonna get attached. I bet this is what it's like when Barack and Michelle have threesomes. You threw her out like trash. No, I didn't. I recycled her. I-I put her back into the world so she could have a new beginning. - (knock on door) - CYNTHIA: Happy anniversary! No, do not answer the door. I cannot deal with your family right now. I can't not answer the door. They're at the door. BOBBY: Hey, Jerrod, you home? Maybe they're not home. CYNTHIA: Well, where else would they be? They're always over our place or here; they got no lives. JOE: Jerrod, you're being rude as hell. Now, I'm gonna kick this door down if I need to. Five, four... Happy anniversary! Took y'all long enough. Look at you two. Still in your bathrobes. Well, that must have been a wild night, huh? - Huh? ! Huh? ! - All right. Okay, okay. All right. Okay. Please stop. (laughs) Of course, the real anniversary comes after you get married, but you kids and your new ways, celebrating dating anniversaries. I just hope you get right with God. Soon, before you have to go to hell forever. But congratulations! So, look, we went to the Pottery Barn, and we got his and her Egyptian cotton towels. Feel it. Uh-huh. That's how they dry their ass in Egypt. It's nice, right? Well, thank you, guys. I'm gonna be in the bedroom. Jerrod, we'll finish this later. Hold on. I think I know what's happening here. We walked in on a little anniversary fight. The most beautiful fight of the year. You know, Jerrod was conceived after a anniversary fight. See, when a man is angry, that's when he's at his most potent. Judging from the anger I'm looking at on y'all's faces, we might be grandparents in nine months. (knock on door) Sorry, I just... Well, who is this? Oh, hey, hey. It's not actually a good time. My parents came by, so... I left my bra, okay? Just give it to me and I'll leave. "Bra"? Did she just say "bra"? Yeah, I heard "bra," Mama. You did say "bra," right, lady? JERROD: Hey, okay. Look, just wait right there. I'll go grab it, okay? Hi, Jessica. Hi. So, uh... did y'all have a little sleepover or something? Yeah, something like that. Oh, so you're visiting from out of state? No. Okay. Here you go. Thanks for coming by. Bye. This isn't my bra. Oh, God. Jerrod, that is mine. I'm... Oh, here. Thank you. Okay. So, uh, y'all went to high school together? No. Okay. Jerrod got a shirt just like that. Um, here. Thanks. Yo, something went down, and we're gonna figure it out. I know, because I've been wearing bras since before you boys were born, and I have never forgotten one somewhere. It just seems impolite to be taking off your bra at your friend's house. Yeah, if I take my drawers off at a friend's house, that means something horrible has happened. This is very peculiar. Okay, there's nothing suspicious, okay? Stop trying to figure something out. So... a girl stayed over, and she left her bra in y'all bedroom, and then there's a lot of tension in the air. (chuckles) It's pretty clear what went down. Well, what did you deduce, Bobby? Jerrod and Maxine had a threesome last night. A threesome? ! Oh, my God. I solved the case. (laughs) Let me get this straight. Y'all had an orgy last night? Let's not make a big deal about this, okay? JOE: Well, I'm having conflicted feelings. On the one hand, I'm proud of my son, and on the other hand, I'm very disappointed in Maxine. Man, this double standard thing between men and women is real. Can we please just drop this? You're always trying to steal my thunder, Jerrod. Look, I was just about to break the news that I finally slept with an Asian chick. But, no, Jerrod got to have it all. God, I did not wake up this morning thinking I would find out that my boy is engaged to a lesbian. This does not make me a lesbian. Are you sure, Maxine? 'Cause sometimes being a lesbian can lay dormant in your system for years, then it can come back on you out of nowhere, like an acid flashback. Maxine, is this one of those silly things where you're trying to prove how open-minded you are? Last week, you tried the vegan diet. This week, you've been with another woman. You need to pick out your identity and stick with it! Jerrod? I can't control what they say. So, y'all had a threesome on your three-year anniversary. So, on the fourth, is it gonna be four people? Or what if you're together as long as Mom and Dad? 35 people? When does it end? ! MAXINE: All right. Everybody, get out of my apartment! - Joe, what's happening? - She allowed to do that? Maxine. I liked you better when you were straight! And, Jerrod, I'm taking these towels. And you'll never know what it's like to dry your ass like an Egyptian. Then I guess I know when I'm not wanted. Jerrod, congratulations on your threesome. I couldn't be more proud of you if you were the first Carmichael to graduate from college. And, Maxine... shameful day all around. Maxine, what's that about? You can't just throw my parents out. Oh, well, maybe I wouldn't have to if you would just stand up for me. What does that mean? Maxine. What's wrong? Come on. Come on, talk to me. Look, I'm not a traditional woman who wants some big church wedding, I'm not sure that I ever want kids, and I will never have dinner waiting for you when you get home, but I do want you to just come to my rescue every once in a while. Like, when your parents call me a whore. That would be a great time for you to step up for me. No one used that exact word. Jerrod, look, you... you challenge me intellectually, and you push me to try new things and you make me laugh, but, my God, are you bad with feelings. And it's fine if you want to pretend like you don't have any, but I do. And I need you to think about them. And I don't want to have to tell you to do that. Maxine, here's something that I don't think you realize about me: I am not a good boyfriend, okay? It doesn't mean that I don't love you. It just means that, uh, I'm bad at it. Jerrod, you're not gonna get out of this by trying to get me to lower my expectations. I mean, why would I have agreed to marry you? Why would I stay in a relationship like that? I don't think you will... okay? And, I don't know, sometimes that scares me. Wait. You think that I'm gonna break up with you? Why? Because I'm not a good boyfriend. Isn't that what this whole fight is about? Well, maybe if you would just be a good boyfriend, you wouldn't have to be worried about me breaking up with you. Well, we are in a real chicken-or-egg situation here, aren't we, Maxine? Look, you are a caring, compassionate, loving person. When you want to be. No, I'm not. I'm beginning to worry that you don't know who I am. Oh, God, yes, you are! I mean, Jerrod, I saw that person last night. We were so in sync. You knew everything that I wanted. I mean, midway through, you just went and got me a bottle of sparkling water. Yeah, 'cause I could tell you were thirsty. And I was, and you knew that. And, see, this is what I'm talking about. Yeah, but that's different, Maxine. A threesome is a very fragile, delicate situation. If I weren't attentive to all your needs, that whole thing could've fallen apart. So, why not be that guy all the time? Huh. So you want me to live every day like we're in the middle of a threesome? If that's the only way for you to understand how to be a loving, compassionate person who thinks about my feelings, then, yeah, that's what I'm trying to say. Okay, no, no, I hear you, Maxine, I hear you. So, what you're saying is that this relationship isn't just about me. Yes. (chuckles) And you're saying that I should, like, pay attention to your needs, even in, like, regular, everyday situations. Yes. I really hope these aren't completely new thoughts for you. You know what, Maxine? Come with me to my parents' house. I need to go stand up for you. I should've done that from the beginning, but I'm gonna show them another side of me. I'm gonna show them Threesome Jerrod. Boy, this analogy is really sticking, huh? Yeah, it's really clearing a lot of stuff up for me. Oh. Maxine, let's go. But wear something nice 'cause we got to make a stop first. But I promise it's gonna be romantic and really spontaneous. Where are we going? All right, you guys, sit down and listen up. You guys insulted Maxine, and you can't do that, okay? Because she has feelings, and her feelings are connected to my feelings. I love this girl. Last night, she gave me a threesome. Do you know what that means to me? That means everything to me. Jerrod, why do you keep bringing up this threesome? I am your mother. This is disgusting. Well, I'm feeling badly. Maybe I took it a little too far when I called Maxine a lesbian and implied that she was a ho and whatnot. We cool? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Joe, okay. Jerrod, tell them the other thing. Oh, yeah, that's right, my bad. Maxine and I got married. We just did it at the courthouse. You got married? ! At the courthouse, no wedding? ! Nope. My partner in threesomes has become my partner in life. Now give us back our towels! Now, Dad, Mom... No! Look, I consider myself pretty progressive, but what you guys have done in the last 12 hours is insane. But hold on, now. Did y'all really get married? Yeah. Turns out all you got to do is pay $60 and sign something. Yeah. I'm Maxine North-Carmichael. You hyphenated? Lord, even your name is a threesome! Well, this is not the way I expected my son to get married, but regardless, I'm happy. All right, everybody, bring it in. Welcome to the family, Maxine. Aw, thank you. Cynthia, come on, bring it in now. Why? So y'all can try and have sex with me, too? No, thank you! Well, look, after yesterday's threesome, y'all wedding night is really gonna be a disappointment. So... does a threesome last twice as long or half as long? I'm not giving you any details, Bobby. This is my wife we're talking about. Did you do the thing where you, you know, you, like, grab the leg... Okay, you know what, Bobby? Everything that you're imagining we did, we did, twice. I hate you. What? Look, sorry, I can't help it but to sound resentful. But let me ask you something. (clears throat) Is it weird that I can't stop picturing my brother having sex? Yes. Yes, it is weird, Bobby. Is it even weirder that I don't want to stop picturing it? Please leave my apartment. Fine! I don't need this. You know something? I bet you haven't pictured one time me having sex with that Asian chick. And you know why? It's because you're selfish! - Previously on "The Mist"... - There's something out there. MIKHAIL: The Black Spring. It's like our version of Santa, but instead of not getting gifts, if you don't behave, you'll be torn apart alive. My family's at the mall. I've gotta get to them. What if it doesn't have any keys? - I'll bet Mia knows how to hot-wire. - Of course I do. What if we put the bodies outside, use them as bait... - What the hell? - They were American soldiers! - [shouting] - Hey, stop it! - Guys, guys. - Stop it! I think we need to establish a set of rules. Whoever endangers the group is thrown out of the mall. It's okay to be scared about what happened. Should I be scared about the people who hung themselves or that big cloud of whatever-it-is outside, or do you mean that I'm stuck in this mall with the guy who raped me? Who says I'm feeling anything? Your daughter gets drunk and screws around, and it's my boy's fault? But then again, that makes perfect sense, knowing your wife. [man grunts] MIA: Jesus! We gotta go! Over there. Driver's seat. Will this help? Shit. Hey! Connor dropped it. Next time somebody drops a gun, you give it to me. You didn't see what happened to Mikhail. What happened to Mikhail? A giant moth killed him! A giant moth? Can we get going? I don't like it here. I just need this one and then this one, and then, there. What the... Come on! I thought you said you knew how to do this. I can! I can. Something's wrong. What do you mean, something's wrong? ! I've done this a thousand times! Even if the battery's dead, we should hear the ignition trying to catch. - Listen. - [click] Come on. What the... Come... [muttering] We need to find a working car. Uh... all right, all right. There's a gas station right around the corner from here. ADRIAN: We can't go back out there. Well, how long do you think we've got before something happens? It seems like the mist comes and go, right? It's thicker when we're out there, and then it kind of disappears when we're not. Yeah, it was super thick when Mikhail, you know... Okay, okay. So we wait for it to withdraw a little bit, and then we make a run for it. Okay? - Okay. - All right. The mist is starting to thin out. Okay. - Just follow me, all right? - Yep. - You stay close to me. - Okay. KEVIN: Okay. 1, 2... 3. No! Leave me alone! - What's going on? - Man: Leave her alone! Sue! - Calm down now. - Come on. [gasping] - I can't breathe. - Okay. I can't breathe. - [sobbing] - Come on. Come on. It's okay. It's okay. Another panic attack? Well, there's nothing to do but sit around being scared. That's why we gotta distract 'em. Let's see what we got here. - All right. - Here you go. Who's up for poker? Yeah, sure. Here. Take this one. What? Those teens won't say no to Bridgeville's star quarterback. Go long. Yeah. [sighs] Look, babe, nothing was gonna happen. Maybe you just listen to me once, you know, instead of always listening to your asshole friend. Hope you geniuses aren't planning another science experiment. Hey, if I'm looking to get date raped, I'll invite you into the conversation. [piano playing "The Entertainer"] [pounds keyboard] - Are you all right, Father? - It's a little out of tune. [off-key notes] Father? You know I've always been devout. I've... I believe in the Bible. I live life by His word... more or less. Do you think you lost your faith, Father? Lose my faith? How could I? I've just seen a demon appear and the smoke rising from the pit to torment mankind just as it's written in Gospel. I'm not scared because I'm losing my faith. I'm scared because it's stronger than ever. If we were judged right now, how many under our roof would burn? Would Mrs. Raven? Or will God forgive her because she's gone crazy? Would the Chief? We've all seen his pride. Would you? Would you? The more I believe, the more I know it's my responsibility to save them... and I've never been more afraid. NATALIE: Are you there? Are you there? Are you there? Who are you looking for, Natalie? I don't know yet. Friends, would you gather, please? - Mrs. Raven? - Mm, not right now. Most of you have been coming here for years. Most of you know me, just as I know you and your families. We know each other too well for me to... - preach. - Mm-hm. Instead, I will talk to you here. I believe Judgment Day has come. [laughs] And I'm... I'm laughing, because I... I watch TV. I... I like baseball. I... I listen to music. I have a beer every now and then. I'm not the Judgment Day kind of guy. You know that. And yet, here we are. I hope I'm wrong. I hope the police get here to save us. But until then, I will do whatever I can to help save your souls... pray with you. Mrs. Raven, please. That's very sweet, Father, but there's really no need. The moth is a good friend of mine. And how is that possible? We met in my garden the other day. She landed on my hand. Will you care to explain to us what it was doing here, then? I don't know, but I'll find out. Are you there? I didn't see any cars out there. There's nothing in here, either. Maybe this guy will give us a ride. [brakes squeak] [breathing heavily] Any way to get any gas out of those? I wouldn't want to be out there long enough to find out. You're Eve's husband, right? Yeah. You know where she is? I'm sorry. I'm Clay. Kevin. I had a kid in her class. I have a... He was outside when all this happened. He's safe somewhere. I know it. I just gotta find him. I'm sure he is. Have you seen him? No. Sorry. You should, uh... You should stay here, get some rest. I haven't slept in two days. You can, uh, put it in the garage. Please tell me why we're lying to this poor bastard. We should tell him. He has a working car, and in case you haven't noticed, we're kinda stuck here. It's your wife and kid. Like you care about them. I'll talk to him. I'll get him to take us. Good. You gonna keep your mouth shut? I don't know. Are you gonna convince him? Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here. Uh... it's okay. I guess you think I'm crazy as well. - Kind of. - Mm, I may be, but I can see you're not yourself. Can I do anything? They took my gun. I don't think they'll rob a bank. [sighs] I just let three prisoners escape in front of the whole church. So what? It's my job to enforce the law. Oh, the law is just people trying to control human nature, as if that were possible. No one can do that, not even you. Thanks, Natalie. There will be food soon, if you want. Natalie? Uh, I think my presence makes Father Romanov uncomfortable. I insist. You need to eat, honey. But it's so dark. I didn't like the dark either, until my dad found a cure. He made up a story called "The Owl Who Says What." He even wrote a book about it. Owls say, "Who." Yeah, not this one. The other owls left him by himself alone in the dark, because he was different. - Was he scared? - Yeah, but he discovers a way not to be afraid of the dark. How? I could read it to you if you want. I'm sure the bookstore has it. You want to go? We're gonna go to the bookstore. I guess. Sure. [kiss] I'll tidy up. She adores her father. He must be a good guy. He is. How bad is it between you and him? Is it that obvious? [chuckles] I was married for 10 years. I mean, not married, because we couldn't get married, but we lived together, and I loved her. But she was the most annoying person I've ever met. I know a frustrated woman when I see one. Kevin's a good person. He's kind and sensitive. He's patient. He's a great listener. He sounds awful. His love for Alex is endless. He needs her love to be the same. He needs it so much, he can't say no. He never could. And now, it put her in danger. I'm happy he's not here. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, bless us, O Lord, and these, thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Jesus Christ, our Lord. In the name of the Father and of the Son - and the Holy Spirit, amen. - GROUP: Amen. What are you reading, Mrs. Raven? The journal of one of the first priests here. I found it in your office. Well, if you have any questions about church history, I'd be happy to help. Did you know this is not the first time nature's come alive? Six people were killed by wildlife here in Bridgeville on May 12th in 1860. Five more the next day. Three more the following. And you think this is related to what we saw outside? Of course. They called it the Black Spring. Natalie, I... You're looking for answers. We're all looking for answers. It's human. But I beg you, look in the Bible. Your answers are there. Not just to this, to your pain as well. Why look f... Do you even know what you're looking for? There it is. What? What I'm looking for. WOMAN: Ooh, that's a big one. - Oh, I got it. - No! I found it. Thank you. Dinner is served. Thanks. I'm sorry about the gun. You see anyone else when you were out there? We've been Kill Petrelli. That's obviously easier said than done. We need to use Molly. She can find Peter anywhere in the world. You know I can't just do that. It's not that simple. It is. If you won't ask her, I will. I'm not afraid of you. No, but you are afraid of Peter. And you know he won't stop, not ever. Until we find him. And we kill him. Let me out! I must save the world! The future depends on it! Senator Petrelli? Senator, you need to make a choice. There are a lot of historical desks available. Where's Tracy? Isn't it her job to make these decisions? Miss Strauss isn't answering her cell. Take the John Foster Dulles. It sends the right message. Which one would you pick? Robert Kennedy's. Kennedy it is. Thank you. You know, I thought you'd be enjoying this. You're a Senator. Back in the seat of power, where you belong. Able to do God's work here on earth. God's work? I'm picking out desks. What's the real problem here, Nathan? You. You're the real problem. You don't trust me? I'm hurt. I'm the only one who can see you. What, that's a problem? Don't play me, okay? I've been around people who can do amazing things. What are you? What are you, a telepath? No, nothing that obvious. You know what it is? It's brain damage from the shooting. The shooting that you so miraculously survived. Come on, Nathan. I mean, healing, flying. I mean, isn't that the work of angels? So you're saying you're an angel? You're a murderer. You wanted to destroy New York City. Kill millions of people. If I remember correctly, you did, too. What exactly do you want from me? I want to help you. First as Senator. Then President. President? The greater the fall, the grander the ascension. Isn't that what you've always wanted? Trust me, this is the path to salvation. It's not my path, not if you're leading the way. This place is disgusting. The milk's gone bad. Didn't you notice? Look, I don't need you cleaning up after me. Obviously you do. You don't look well. I'm just tired. No wonder. Working all hours. No food, no fresh air. I have lots to do. Come on, let's get out of here. I can't. But it's a beautiful day outside. And you've been cooped up in here... Working for you! Trying to find some way to take away your ability! Isn't that what you want? I came because I care about you. You want me to go? Fine. Wait. I didn't mean to yell. I'm just tired. I will find the answers for you. I promise. Journal entry 13. The rash is spreading. I don't know what it is or its connection to my aggression. The formula is transforming me and I fear... I fear what I am becoming. The formula is transforming me. I fear what I'm becoming. The formula is transforming me. And I fear... I fear what I'm becoming. Mohinder? What do you want? I need your help. I need you to tell me everything you know about Sylar. Sylar? I have to find him. He's supposed to help me. But, why? Why Sylar? Mohinder, are you okay? What happened to you? What's going on? Mohinder? Do not repeat my mistakes. What happened to you? I wanted abilities. Impetuous. Selfish. I got the formula wrong. So wrong. Let me help you. Tell me about Sylar. Sylar's power is dangerous. You don't understand it. I need to understand. Where is he? Where is Sylar? Costa Verde. The Bennet house. Don't go! Hey, Uncle Peter. Dad's making waffles. What's up, champ? How you doing, man? Good to see you. Who wants some waffles, huh? Who else should get some waffles? Mr. Muggles. Okay, a little piece of waffle. But just 'cause you're such a good dog. Yes, he is. Oh, you're such a good dog. Yes, you're a very good doggy. Peter, it's so good to see you. I haven't seen you in so long. If you told me you were coming, I would have made extra. What's the magic word? Abracadabra. Well, that's a magic word, so it's close enough. Where's your scar, Uncle Peter? You know what, grown-ups need to have a little chat in the other room. So, I'm gonna get you started on your waffle. All right, there you go. You gonna be okay? Yes. Yes. I know you are. We're just gonna be in the other room, all right? You're not from around here, are you? No scar. The past, right? Which means to you, I'm the bogeyman. It's a hell of a thing, you coming here to find out that you and I are brothers. Brothers? I'm sorry that you've come all this way, Peter, but I can't help you. Can't? Won't. Why? I'm not gonna give it to you, my ability. I'm not. Then I'll just take what I need from you. As if you could. Peter is dead. They killed him. And now they are after me. I am not leaving without your abilities, Sylar. My name is Gabriel. And you don't realize my ability is not just understanding how things work, there's a hunger that comes with it. To know more, to have more, I couldn't control it and it turned me into a killer. A monster. And every day is a struggle, every hour. But I fight it for him. And I am not going to willingly condemn you to hell. If I have your ability, if I can understand the variables, then I can... You can save the world? The world always needs saving, Peter. You're all going to die. Your family, your son. This world is gonna end. If you don't believe me, here, paint it. See for yourself, paint the future. Don't let him see me. Not like this. Do you understand? No, no way. No, we're not dragging Molly into this. But, Matt... We're both raising her. Yes, to be a normal little girl, not to be your bloodhound. No, it's just this once. We use her ability to find Peter. Peter Petrelli is a murderer and a terrorist, and... And he's the villain, not me. This is our chance to stop Peter now. Forever. I just... I don't understand why you would risk your life when you've got this beautiful baby girl waiting for you at home. You are beautiful. This is everything to me. You. This family. And this is the part where the "but" comes in, Daniella. But I was a cop. And I know what it's like to have a spouse who's worried if you're ever going to come home alive. I'm gonna be fine. Nothing can touch me. Right. You're a wife and a mother. It's time for you to slow down. We find Peter. We catch him and then... You can consider me settled. You're not gonna let this go, are you? And miss a chance to stop Peter and all the pain and misery he's caused? We have to. Molly. You guys done arguing? We weren't... Your mother needs to talk to you for a second. Everything's gonna be fine. Peter's in Costa Verde. Sylar. Sylar, yeah. You're afraid? Don't act like I don't know what I'm talking about. You stink of it. So, what if I am? So, Claire Bennet isn't afraid of anything. I just killed my uncle. And I have to do it again. Give me a second to be a human being. You see the problem is, Claire, unlike you, Daphne and I can die. So, get your head on straight. Sylar? It's a scar. A reminder of what I was. Of what I can be. Fix it. I don't know a thing about watches. You want to learn how to access my ability. Fix the watch. Listen to it. Like a symphony, every piece has its part. All coming together in perfect harmony. If you can understand the complexities of a watch you can understand anything. Everything. Cause. Effect. Action. Reaction. How to change the future. You have it now. I'm so sorry. Daddy! Not now, Noah. Yes. Now. Noah, stay where you are, buddy. Noah. It's gonna be okay, buddy. Let's not make this any harder than it already is, Peter. Just come quietly. And we'll leave them alone. Don't do it, Peter. Teleport out. Now. I'm not leaving you. I brought this into your house. No. This was my house! You took everything from me. Claire, I never meant for you to... Shut up! What's it going to be? The boy or you? You don't want anyone to get hurt, do you? Just... First let the boy go. Not till you're dead. You're gonna kill me? One bullet in the back of the head should do the trick. Then I'll let the boy go. I'm not the guy that you killed this morning, Claire. Look, this is me. You're not going to kill me. Yes, I am. What happened to you? How did you get this way? I learned how to take care of myself. Noah! Daddy! Go, hide over there. Go now. I understand your power. You get stronger with fear. I'm not afraid of you. But he is. Noah, run. Run! Daddy! Noah? They killed him! Gabriel! Save us! Ando? Metropolitan Police Department. Detective Russick, please. This is Detective Russick. Are you the detective working the Jim McCann case? Yes, I am. I have some information about him. Who is this? I... I... Hello? I killed him. Damn it! Journal entry 16. I cannot reverse the process, cannot remove the ability. Not from Maya. Not from myself. It's a part of me now. Yes? You stuck your nose where it didn't belong! So did you. ...and the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. Please, show me my path. You picked the Kennedy desk. Good choice. Hey. You're back. Did you find what you were looking for? My resignation. I know I dragged you into this. And I'm sorry. I just can't do this anymore. Nothing I can say to change your mind? No. I know what I have to do now. You must pray for guidance. This is your path. You're just gonna have to trust me, Nathan. You must help her. Drink? Yeah. Are you okay? No. So... You can fly? Yeah. I can't believe this is happening. Yeah. I have to show you something. Your hands aren't even cold. Costa Verde is gone. The single greatest tragedy in American history. The First Lady and I mourn this tremendous loss and urge all of you to find your families, find your loved ones. And that we pray together as a family and as a nation. Are you trying to teleport? That's not going to work with my friend here. Two hundred thousand people died in Costa Verde. I want you to feel the pain of every single death. That's one. I can save them. Everyone in Costa Verde. This whole world. It doesn't have to be like this, Claire. You don't have to be like this. I saved you once, I can save you again. No. That's two. Stop. I'd like a moment with my brother alone. Is this the President or my father speaking? Both. I know what you're doing. I've seen it. The world splitting in half. I'm not ignorant. I've seen the paintings. I've heard the dreams. I know what's going on. You're strong, Pete. But one man cannot save the world. It's everybody's responsibility. Everybody with abilities. Yeah, an army with abilities. Congress has agreed to full proliferation because of Costa Verde. Because of you. Now, I know you think people can't be trusted. That we're all greedy and power-hungry. But we were created in God's image, Pete. There's a goodness to man. Pete. You don't trust me. You've been manipulated before by Linderman. You were going to blow up New York City. You can read minds. Read mine. Peter? I understand your intentions. Your emotions. You believe that you're doing the right thing, but you're wrong. Peter, stop. It hurts! I need. I need to... I need to... understand... I need to... your intentions. Mr. President? Mr. President, are you all right? Peter. What are you doing? I went to the future. The world ended. I took your ability so I could understand how to stop it. You took my ability? You have the hunger. You're like me. I will never let myself become you. You already are, Brother. This was the scene above Costa Verde just hours ago. Everything within four miles has been completely incinerated. The sky is dark with smoke and debris. We can only imagine how massive... It's my fault. I told her to go to Costa Verde. Daniella needs her bottle. Come on. But I... Go take care of your sister. Now! Rescue operations are still limited with the danger of radiation poisoning. Any search for survivors is going to take time. But it's hard to imagine anyone still alive in there. The Army and National Guard are only now beginning to assess the extent of the destruction. Daphne! I wasn't fast enough. No, no, no, no. Come on. Come on, you'll be fine. You'll be just fine. Welcome back. What happened to me? I was in the future. Did I time travel? No. You never left. You were asleep. Dreaming. Dreaming? No, no, no. No, it was real. It was. I was there. She was there. Everybody had abilities. The bomb. The baby. It was real. It was real. Her name is Daphne. I've got to find her. It's a big world. Lots of people. You sent me on this journey. Come on. You must find your totem. A spirit guide that attaches to your subconscious. It will lead you on your journey. What is that? Some African mystical mojo thing? Carl Jung, Analytical Psychology. You don't read much, do you? All right. What is this totem supposed to look like anyway? Usually an animal. Think about your dream and you will find your guide. Where's Kaito's part of the formula? What's so important about this formula? It can turn people like you into people like us. And that will lead to disaster. The formula is gone. Stolen. There were two parts to that formula. They have both and we have lost. Your father loved you dearly, Hiro. He had faith you would grow up to be a great man. But he was mistaken. And his folly will be the downfall of us all. I am sorry. No, you're not. I'm not? Don't apologize to her! This is Hiro Nakamura! He will not rest until that formula is safe! What he said. Someone is manipulating us. Someone powerful. Hidden. And they must be stopped. I will find them and stop them. Actually, you're the only one who can. You have the key to unlocking this entire mystery. I do? Hmm. Hiro, you son of a... You should come back as my majority leader. No, thanks. When this term is up... I'm out of politics. I own most of the land around here. But what I don't own, I need the state to grab under eminent domain. What if the state agreed to pay double the appraised value of the land - inside the eminent domain zone? - What would you say... If I could deliver double the assessed value on all your land inside the eminent domain zone? Cassie and I split up. I'm sorry, Decco. I am. Janakowski's gonna know he's being set up. Hookin' a mark's like doin' a cha-cha. Two steps forward and one step back. You got some splainin' to do. Colin decked me. What happened? No, it was an accident. I think he's fucking Kath. - Colin wouldn't do that. - I know. Look at this shit! Fuckin' piles of shit! Everywhere! I've never seen so much shit in one place! - What are you doing? - Fuck! Ever wonder why we don't have people over to the house? We don't have people over because you don't have any friends. - And you don't like mine. - We don't have people 'cause it's a fuckin' embarrassment, that's why! It's a fuckin' pigsty! - Then why don't you hire a maid? - You'd like that, wouldn't ya? You'd sit on your fuckin' skinny ass all day. My mother worked every day of her life, but her house was neat as a pin! Your mommy is a fucking anal-retentive shrew who couldn't hold on to a man. - What did you say? - You heard me. My mother is a fuckin' saint compared to you! Then go worship her. And don't come back! The kid at the counter recommended that one. It's about a man who falls in love with a blow-up doll. Not the dirty type of blow-up doll. - I don't feel much like a movie. - Well, there's a last one. Love in the time of... cholera? It's not the greatest title, but... Kath finally throw you out, huh? No. Of course not. I just need a good night's sleep. I'll see you in the morning. I'm crashin' out. Not upstairs, you're not. That's Colin's room now. It's OK. I'll sleep on the couch. You'll do no such thing. Michael can sleep on the couch. Sheets for the couch are in the lower shelf of the linen closet. He's downstairs on the couch. What happened? He went fuckin' nuts. That's what happened. Did he say anything... about... What would he say? We haven't done anything. Right... I think he knows something. There's nothin' to know. Right? Don't worry. Shut the fuck up up there! I want the roof to extend over the entire porch. The pitch needs to be lowered a little. It's kind of Hansel and Gretel at the moment. Can you make those changes and fax 'em over to me? - Busy? - Never too busy for you, Mr. Speaker. I need to tap into your knowledge bank. I know you got one foot out the door, but the taxpayers are still paying you. What do you need? Hanley and Fratelli. I need both their votes to get the budget passed. But both of them want funding for their districts to get bridge repair. And you've only got money for one bridge. So I offered both of them half funding for two years. Both said no. They both got elections to win. So, what do I do? I don't know. Flip a coin. You know what? I should've trusted my instincts, not bothered you with it. Take 'em both out for a steak dinner... together. Let Hanley choose the wine, he considers himself a connoisseur... and don't talk business with Fratelli until he finishes his third martini. After that, you'll find him much more friendly. - That's it? - That's it. You're the man with the answers, Tommy Caffee. There are no deals goin' down on the waterfront. Is there somethin' about me that looks stupid? I'm tellin' ya. Tommy and Don-Don have decreed it. Caffee and the Speaker Donatello have declared absolutely no deals on the waterfront? Why would they go and do somethin' like that? That's above my pay grade. Speculate. Because they're greedy pigs. Tommy cuts a sweetheart deal with Bob Meara. Pays double the appraised value of the land seized under eminent domain. Why would he cut such a terrible deal for the state unless he's gettin' a piece of the action? Here you go. That's on us. Ten of the parcels that were seized by eminent domain... were owned... by some company, B.S.C. Holdings. B.S.C. Holdings. Wait a minute. - That ring a bell? - Yeah, I remember that. Right here. Just a minute. Here it is. It's a holding company controlled by Alfonse Nozzoli. The house leadership rigs a deal... that directly benefits the state's biggest mafioso? It's a deal brokered by Tom Caffee. Yeah, and Bob Meara. Fuckin' Tom Caffee, keepin' the waterfront clean. That's bullshit. All right, so we got Tom Caffee, Alfonse Nozzoli... and Bob Meara's the missing' link. You see they passed this law in Colorado? You can use the bathroom you want based on the sex you think you should've been born. What the hell's that mean? Some fruitcake wants to be a broad but he can't afford the operation, he can go to the girls' room. I want his ass in the women's bathroom, so that's a good law. You all right there, boss? I got a crick in my neck. What if I wanna use the women's room? You can't. You're happy with the sex you were born. Cop's gonna tell that by lookin' at me? Hey, how many? Gimme two. You remember you're supposed to meet Nozzoli in a half an hour? Don't need you to be my calendar. Well, we better get goin', because the radio says 195's backed up. Finish your game. Freddie's drivin' me today. Freddie, let's go. I'm playin' cards. What's with all this new age bullshit? They're fuckin' robins, you know? They're not flyin' to my yard from the lost continent of Atlantis. Why don't you buy one of those? Put a St. Francis statue next to it. They'll cancel each other out. You got him well trained. So what am I doin' here? What do you want? My guys aren't getting any construction contracts on the waterfront. The word is that your brother's on some kind of moral high horse about keeping the waterfront squeaky-clean. - What's that got to do with me? - Don't waste my time, OK? Do you really expect me to believe that your brother's not giving out jobs to you and your mick cronies? You can believe whatever you want. Exceptin' what you gave me, I got no part of the waterfront action. I know calling' you a liar at this point would probably be counterproductive. So instead, I'm gonna politely ask you... to tell your brother that he needs to open up the tap, so people beside you can wet their beaks. My beak... is bone fuckin' dry. My brother's got nothin' to do with me, and I got nothin' to do with him. You're not gonna deliver on this for me? It's not that I won't... but I can't. Any birdbaths for birds that don't look like they need their fortunes told? - Turnin' down Nozzoli, was a mistake. - To hell with Nozzoli. The man doesn't wanna believe the truth when he hears it, I can't help him. You could've shine him on, said you'd make an effort. I should quiver in my boots as well? Maybe piss my pants? Fuck him. I know how the guy's mind works. He's a prick. Bow and scrape a bit, he doesn't take it so personal when you tell him no. I get this ball in the hole, the volcano goes off. I get a free game. Free game! I'm not explaining this well. Every time you sell a pill to one of your golfing' customers, I get five bucks. Right? I gave you 300 pills. - That's 1,500 bucks. - That's what I gave you. That's 1,200 bucks. You either cough up the rest or I'm gonna take six putters and shove 'em up your ass. And then I'm gonna wrap you around the windmill. He's right, Moe. 1,500. It's all there. Let me see it. Excuse me, sweetheart? Could we get two cappuccinos, please? Just for him. Check for me. You... Tom Caffee and Alfonse Nozzoli, huh? - "Mind if I sit down? May I join you?" - You're bent. I know you're bent. You know you're bent. Alfonse Nozzoli knows you're bent, because you're in his fuckin' pocket. I'm gonna write down your badge number. Sure. It's right there. Then, I'm gonna go back to my office and file a complaint with your commanding officer. See, I don't have a commanding officer. I'm head of a freelance task force, so that gives me the authority to fuck with who I want when I want. We all have to answer to somebody. You know, I actually don't need you to tell me anything. See, all I need... is for that guy sittin' over there... See him? The guy in the blue shirt. The one giving you the stink eye ever since I sat down. I just need him to see us together, because... he's gonna go report that to Nozzoli... which, unfortunate for you... is gonna give Nozzoli the impression that you're talkin' to the cops. - Even if you're not. - Here's your cappuccino. Just the check. Thank you. I have a committee meeting in 10 minutes. After that... I'm gonna call the head of the state police and get you suspended. Enjoy the rest of your afternoon. I said shut the fuck up! Are you kiddin' me? Can I help you? I'm tryin' to do some work downstairs. Right, captain. Sorry, captain. I was just practicing my close order drill. - You just keep it down, OK? - You got it, captain. Jesus Christ. Excuse me. I'm not crazy. I'm a reenactor. Civil War. Seventh Virginia, under major General George E. Pickett. I don't wanna hear anybody ordering' chicken unless they're ordering' steak and lobster at the same time. None of this fixed price menu bullshit or two appetizers... Thank you. Pick yourself out a nice bottle of wine. - We don't need a whole bottle. - Don't do the nice stuff by the glass. This is terribly fancy, Michael. It's not every day a man take out the most beautiful women in his life - and spoil them rotten. - Hear, hear. - Anything you like there? - Not at these prices. Will ya... Please, don't worry about the prices, OK? As far as you're concerned, the prices don't exist. Marty. See that nice family over there? Send them over a bottle of champagne. - Tell 'em it's from me. - We have a very nice Veuve Clicquot. - The house is good. - Right away. It ain't like they're fuckin' family, right? Excuse me. This is a gift from the gentleman in the corner. Is that... someone you... - work with? - No, it's a friend... just payin' his respects. Domestic. It was nice anyway, huh? He sees I'm with my family. Cheapest one on the list. - Let me see that. - 32.50. Maybe they only had domestic. Doesn't look like he's drinkin' domestic. Domestic champagne gives me a headache. There you are, ma'am. None for me. - And you, sir. - Thank you. - And you, ma'am. - Thank you. And there you are, sir. I see the crib finally made it out of the box. And the box made it out to the trash. So maybe by the time the baby's in 1st grade, - he'll actually have a place to sleep? - I'd say kindergarten at the latest. Tommy, we've really got to get it put together. - You wanna do it right now? - Not really. Don't worry. It'll be built by the time you start having contractions. - Promise we can do it tomorrow? - Absolutely. You know how much money I make for that prick? And he sends my family the cheapest bottle of fucking champagne on the menu. - Better to send nothing. - 'Cause it's not only cheap, it's bad. I drank some of that stuff on New Years, it's like drinkin' Cabernet with piss. Maybe Nozzoli doesn't know champagne. It's French, what does he know from France? When you find where his mother lives, send her a bottle of lasti spermati. - What's his mother done to anybody? - No, no. How about this? I send him a bottle... No, I send him a fuckin' case of that champagne that the rappers drink, the $400 a bottle shit, with a big bow on top. Teach him some fuckin' manners. Yeah, Colin. Delivery boy. Get a case over to Nozzoli, fast as you can. Me? No fuckin' way. He'd pop me on principle. And make sure it gets there before cocktail hour. And get yourself somewhere else to sleep tonight. I'm not sleepin' on that fuckin' couch again. I'm glad I caught you. I wanted to thank you. I am taking Hanley and Fratelli to McCormick and Schmick's for dinner. And I was thinking, maybe you could join us. I know. But I swear. It's the last thing I'm gonna ask you to do. You don't need me. You need 3 T-bones, 9 martinis and a bottle of Pauillac. It's not gonna be that easy. It took 3 songs and a dance to get 'em to agree on a restaurant. It's a free dinner, and all I ask is you work the Tommy Caffee magic on 'em. You've always been better at this than I am. I've never known you to plead insecurity. Need a hand gettin' this budget passed. Then I let you sail off into retirement. I'll be there. Rezie's at 6:00. At home to Eileen by 10:00. So I didn't get suspended. Does that mean we're talkin'? If you'd step away from the car, please. Are you too stupid to be afraid? Is that it? I haven't done anything wrong. You know, they all say that. They all end up dead too! This isn't gonna work. It will if you sell it. Just scare the piss out of him. Use your best mob voice. Walk outta your house. Walk out the front fuckin' door of your house. Someone you don't wanna piss off. Come outside now. - I think he's comin'. - Keep it up. If you scare him bad enough, he'll talk. If he talks... Then the whole v? business comes down. I know. Here he comes. You see me? I'm right here. I'm watching you. I know when you're sleepin' and I know when you're awake. And I know when you're schmoozing with cops. Like the good old days, ma, huh? Except in the good old days, I could remember what was in the cupboards. Yeah, well, Colin reorganized 'em. I don't understand. Why isn't he comin' home for his dinner? - Where's he goin' to sleep tonight? - Don't worry about him. He's got stuff to do. He's a big boy. He can take care of himself. Don't you think that you can throw him out just because you decide you want your bed back. Look, this was his idea. He told me we should spend some quality time together. I just fuckin' rememorized all this. - Watch your language, mister! - Sorry. Sorry. - What are you lookin' for? - Just a serving' plate. I stopped by Hennesey's on the way home. Fresh-baked croissants. They're still warm. I can't. They give me heartburn this late in the day. We'll stick 'em in the fridge. We'll have 'em for breakfast. Don't bother. I'm watchin' my girlish figure. Just make the tea, would ya? The tea... is in the pantry. Honestly, you're no use to me at all. I might as well do everything myself. Now, if colin were here, I could relax. "Lemon berry breeze"? What happened to good old Lipton's? Irish breakfast? Here. Open this, would you? Lid's too tight. The lid's not tight, ma. You okay? Something wrong with your hand? Just give me a damn biscotti. Give me a biscotti, OK? We talking today? We already had that conversation. I thought you would've had a change of heart. What about you and your friend Nozzoli? Everything hunky-dory between the two of you? Because if it's not, I'm the only helping hand you got. I'm not interested. Are you out of your mind? This is over the line. I mean it. I'm not kiddin'. If you wanna go down this road, that's your business. I'm out. That's fine. Fuckin' pussy. You tell that scassacazzo I wouldn't fill my fuckin' birdbath with his champagne. - He thinks you disrespected his mother. - Fuck him! Now on, he wants to deal with me, he does it through you. You're his fuckin' ambassador. Al, no disrespect. I can't do that. Not that I blame you. Michael's fuckin' nuts. But... he's also running' the show. Chain of command's chain of command. You gonna stay loyal to him? You want me to put my head in a noose because you're pissed off? There's no law sayin' the Irish have to have a presence in Rhode Island. Either he talks through you, or he doesn't talk at all. I've got a meeting tonight. Can you pick up takeout from that Indian place? I can't. I got a dinner thing with Don-Don. Thanks for letting me know. He sprang it on me at the last minute. I won't be late. I thought we were gonna finally get the crib put together. We'll do it this weekend. Since David's got the tougher reelection race this year, he gets to build his bridge. Next year, you can build yours in South Kingston. You want me to go back to my constituents with nothing? It's... Victor. Another martini for Rep. Fratelli. You got any of those regular olives? No more of the blue cheese ones. How do you feel about parks? Say 10,000 to refurbish the Alonso street playground. On top of which, we can find a few thousand more to save the Tiger Beetle campaign. Which your wife mentioned at the 4th of July picnic. You'd do that? We'll make it part of the wetlands initiative. "Save the Tiger Beetle"? We're not saving anything. We're letting him tell his wife he got money for the Tiger Beetle fund, which in turn will get him laid. It is amazing how good you are at this. Happy to be of service. Now, if I could just get the rest of these reps in line. - Wanna take a look at this? - Not if you don't need me. I don't need you. I could use you, but I don't need you. Give me the list. This bastard... Honey, it's me. I'm sorry I'm late. The Speaker was just... Who did this? I did. I thought we were gonna do it this weekend. Now your weekend's free. - How was your dinner? - Well, dinner was okay, but... I was gonna put it together. Now you can do the changing table and get the diaper genie and all the rest of it. I've just been busy at work. So have I. Except when I'm at my desk, our son reminds me he's there by playing xylophone on my ribs. For Christ's sakes, Tommy, we haven't even talked about names. If the kid's not gonna have stuff, at least we could give him a name. I got it. I'm not the enemy. Who is it? Hold on a second. I'm comin'. Hey, captain. I just... I just wanna apologize for disturbing' you before like I did. Yeah, I'm kind of busy. Me too. Captain? This is for you. At ease. You're a lucky man. So if I'd started my car... No, you would think, but... the explosive was actually triggered by a cell phone. It seems like Nozzoli's guys learned a thing or two from our insurgent friends in Iraq. Excuse me a minute. Tell me what I have to do to protect my family. I know you're doin' me a favor, but... couldn't we have met at a bar or somethin'? I got a wife on the warpath. You wanna give me a hand? Are you goin' for the Jack Kennedy look here? It's not a rockin' chair. It's a glider. It's a present for Eileen to sit in while she's nursing. You ready? Be careful. You look at my budget problem? You don't have the numbers you think you do. You've counted... Calibrisi, and you can't count his vote. He'll say you got it, but the 11th hour he'll hang you out to dry. As for getting Bianchi on the train, he owes Charlie Ingram a favor over the milk label bill. So if you get Ingram, you get Bianchi. And you get Ingram... by giving his assistant an extra personal day. Why? - They sleeping' together? - He wishes they were. Then you can get... Maguire and Zurilli by agreeing to their L.N.G. proposal. You ready? L.N.G. I will take full credit for your insight at the... leadership retreat on Saturday. What time is it? - What do you care? - In case you need help with Zurilli. I can't have you at the retreat. I'm using it to... pump up whoever I anoint as your successor. I don't want the troops to see you and just remind I haven't got anyone half as good as you. Watch your hands here. Lift! Watch your step. What do you think? - You bought a glider? - You're gonna love it. It's really comfortable. - Where's the other stuff? - We'll get it this weekend. Look at this. Or... next weekend, or the weekend after that. What unforgivable sin have I committed now? We don't need a glider. We need a changing table, and a diaper genie and a bouncy seat. How the baby's gonna need that tonight? You could've bought everything on that list, but you bought one thing. A chair. Where I'm gonna be sitting alone in the middle of the night with a crying baby while you sleep the sleep of the dead 'cause you've got an early meeting or a caucus or a vote. I bought it for us. When did you suddenly grow boobs? There are such things as bottles, you know? That's right. Where are they? Did you buy any? I didn't know what type to get. We've had three children, and you can't remember what brand we use? Playtex Ventaire. They sell 'em at Target. I was gonna head out, unless you need me. Why would I need you? Where'd you sleep last night? Tommy and Eileen's. I'll tell you what. Kath wants me back. She's... She needs me, you know? The kids, whatnot. So... You can have your upstairs room back. Kath wants you back? She's a needy cunt. But what you gonna do? You better tell Rose. She'll be upset. She loves having' you at home. That's all right. You tell her. Good night then. You havin' a good time? Just waitin' for the ice cream sandwiches. Goddamn Joe Flannery. Him and his thrift store bow tie. That tight-ass prick wouldn't pay 10c to keep an honest man from hangin', much less vote an extra 20 grand for school lunches. None of this is your problem anymore, is it? You're doin' a smart thing. Steppin' down. It's like runnin' a kindergarten. You remember that guy that sat between you and me our first term? Remember him? What was his name? You know who. Whispered in my ear, tell me what was gonna happen before it happened. Not 'cause anybody told him. He just knew how all these machinations worked. What was his name? Anyway... he's probably playing' golf, laughing' at the likes of us sittin' here till the wee hours. Probably. Nice guy. Stall. Excuse me? You gotta stall. You're not gonna get Flannery until at least 11:00. When his wife starts calling every 20 min to see when he's coming home. Anything else? Turn the air conditioner off. That... documentary about the penguins starts in a few minutes. Lovely. Unless you'd planned to watch somethin' else. I had no plans... except to welcome you home. Motion to close debate on H.R. 12557, house arm of the budget package has been offered and seconded. Membership will have 5 minutes to cast their votes on the bill. Unlock the machine. Halloran. That was the guy's name that sat between us. Halloran. Think I heard that he put together a web site of Rhode Island wildflowers. Won some award or somethin'. Who'd you get to replace me? You're leavin'? What do you think of Campbell? You hate it. No, I think it's a good name... for a soup. Billy? Kevin? Tommy junior? My son's havin' his own name. There's always "hey-you-there-in-that-crib". - Hey. - Hey. How's the writing going? Slow, sluggish, and plodding. Mostly just messing around with my online thesaurus. Hmm, apparently. I was doing some organizing, and look what I found. That was a long time ago. You know what I love about it? That smile on your face. I don't think I've ever seen you look so happy. Makes me wonder if maybe you were happier then. You know? Before the book was published. Before you moved back home. Before us. Lindsey... ...you make me so happy. Really? You wouldn't change anything? Not a thing. tomorrow night, you play for the division ii title. However, in my opinion, you can go up against any college squad in the nation. Now, for those of you who have won a championship, I don't have to remind you how good it makes you feel. The rest of you will just have to trust me. Now, I want you to go home and hit the sheets... preferably alone. Coach. Go home, luke. Actually, I was thinking I was gonna watch a little bit more tape. Lucas, you've been a great assistant coach this year, and someday you're gonna take over the team, but for now, you take orders from me. Go home and go to bed. All right. Oh, and no late- night cyber chats with long- distance blondie. All right. There's my little track star. - Hi! - Hey, buddy. - Oh, sweetie, he is - - ball. Did you hear that? He just said "ball. - " I swear he just said "ball. - " He said "ball, " man. He's definitely your son! And he's a lucky kid. You look more and more like me every day. Say it again.Say it again. "Ball." "Ball. - Hey. - Hi. What time is it? Almost 4:30. I couldn't sleep either. Yeah, neither could he. You just excited about seeing peyton or the game or what? Actually, peyton's not coming. She couldn't get away from work. Oh, I'm sorry, luke. I guess that's life in the music business. I guess. Do you ever miss it? Mm, sometimes. Especially when I see you chasing your dreams of being a writer. But, uh, I'll get back to chasing my dreams someday. All I have to show for my writing career is a stack of rejection letters. Besides, when I see the three of you together, I... I just want what you guys have. You know we could not have done this last year without you living here and helping. Between school and basketball and jamie... I know it's hard to be away from peyton. We all made sacrifices. I mean, for the first time in your academic career, you're getting b'S. It was a b- plus, okay? - Hey. - Yeah? You're a part of this family, and you always will be. Thanks. Night, little man. Ball. Yes.I will get your ball. Little early, aren't you? Well, maybe after tonight people will look at me as a champion again, not a point- shaver. We're gonna win thne, blittlerother. Oh, yeah. This is the ultimate cinderella story. For years the cobras have been perennial doormats, but this season, under the leadership of nathan scott, their fortunes have changed. Attack the gap! Get back on "d"! Come on! Look high- low! Look high- low! After a game that's seen 17 lead changes, we're all tied up with less than a minute to go in the fourth. Scott's been carrying this team, but does he have enough left in his tank? - All right. - Now, listen up. Sorry, coach. What's the game plan? You tell me. You know, I told you someday that you'd be taking over. Well, this is it. You're ready. Go on. Bring us home. It appears whitey durham is headed to the locker room. I guess that leaves the cobras under the leadership of assistant coach lucas scott, who used to play for durham once upon a time. Okay.Heads up. We're gonna go man- to- man, full- court press. I want you to force the ball sidelines. Anticipate this pass over the top. When we get the ball back, they're gonna double- team, so I want you to stagger screens here and here. Nathan, ball's in your hands. Whatever you say... coach. All right. Let's win this. On three. One, two, three. Cobras! Hey, nate! Maybe you want to consider the fadeaway. Fadeaway's weak, man. All right, match up by the 12! Nice. - it's you. - What? When all my dreams come true, the one I want next to me... it's you. It's you, peyton. One Tree Hill Season05 Episode05 Good job, son. You ran that final play just like I would have. Maybe so, but you sure do know how to kick a guy out of the nest. Lucas, you were always a great player, but you're an even better coach. There's nothing more I can teach you, which is why this is my final game. Coach. I've already talked to the dean and the A.D.About it. They've never had a student coach before, but, uh, then again, they've never had a championship before, either. They both agreed that you're ready. I - I don't know what to say. Just promise me you'll always remember there are more important things in life than basketball. So, what about you? I mean, what are you gonna do now? Oh, I don't know.Now that I'm retired, probably go to basketball games and yell at the coach. I would agree with that as well, but, I mean, after a season like that, the d - I scouts have got to take notice. Right now, I'm just happy with playing the game. If there's one thing this year's taught me it's that the most important thing is my family. Hey, nate. - The bus is leaving. - Okay. Hey, thanks for your time. So, how'd it go? That was the first time in a year I didn't get asked about point- shaving. All right. - Hi, sweetie. - Hey, you ready? Oh, you should ride with the team.We just wanted to say goodbye. - See you at home. - See you, hales. Hey, scott.You got a cute kid. Wonder if he'll grow up to be a cheater like his old man. Just think... you could teach him to shave and shave points. Why don't I shave your face on the pavement? Nate! Come on. Get on the bus.Get on the bus! play this song when you win the championship... peyton That was a hell of a move tonight. Soon as the ball left my hands, I knew it was going in. I'm talking about after the game. Look, I didn't put off my pension so you can beat up any jackass that heckles you. I know.I'm sorry. You've worked hard this season. A lot of eyes are on you. But you've got to be careful. If you're not, that temper of yours will be all you have left. I just don't know if people are ever gonna forget the mistakes I've made. The important thing is for you to get past them. I mean, this is not gonna go away just by playing better. You've got to live better. You're right. I get it, coach. Nathan, I just don't want you to look back down the road in a couple of years and wonder what might have been. We all know where that path can lead a man. Dan. For the record, that last shot was a hell of a move. - Hey, coach. - Hey. So, 37 years of coaching... where does this night rank? This would be number three. Number two was your high- school championship. And what was the first? The first was the night camilla agreed to join a scrawny kid just embarking on a 37- year coaching career. There's more important things in life than basketball. That's right. Hey, coach. You wouldn't mind dropping me by the airport, would you? Be happy to, son. Hey, sawyer, you got a call on line 1. Okay. This is peyton. Hey.It's me. I've been trying to call you all morning. I watched the game highlights online. I wish I could have been there. Yeah, me too. So, uh, what are you wearing? Luke, I - I can't do that right now. I'm at work. Well, I'm thinking a pink floyd tee over the long- sleeve white shirt and maybe those sexy jeans with the hole in the knee? Wow.You are good! yes, i'm. Really good. Luke! Hi! I can't believe you're here! Yeah, well, since you couldn't come see me... - hi - Hi. So, uh, this is marketing and distribution? so, I might ve pimped up my job description just a little. Basically, I work in the mail room. Well, that's hollywood, right? It's always abouthe spin. I'll bet you know more about music than most of these tools. Shh, you're gonna get me in trouble. And they are not all tools, okay? Not in the box... on my desk. Right.I'm sorry. And, you, onion bagel, light on the cream cheese. Right away, carl. It's blake! Well, it's good to see they're nice. No.Seriously.Why do you put up with this? I will show you why. See that girl right there? Three months ago she was in thehe mail room, and now she's a junior ar exec. Yeah, but I bet she didn't produce two albums before she graduated high school. Okay.You're gonna have to go before you get us both fired. All right. Look, I got dinner reservations for us at 8:00. Is that too late? No, it's actually... it's kind of early. We usually go till at least 9:00. All right.Then it's 9:30. Perfect.I'll meet you at the restaurant. Just text me the address, okay? All right. God, luke, it is so good to see you. Bye. Hi! I am so sorry.I'm so late. I got stuck going over the canyon. It's okay.I'm just glad you're here. God, look at you! What? No.I just... I haven't seen a suit on anybody in so long, unless they're an agent or a lawyer or a successful novelist. Oh, I don't know about that. I get a new rejection letter every day. Luke, your book is good. It's gonna happen.I know it. So when the executives blow off the shows, we get the tickets. Like monday, I went and saw ryan adams at the viper room, and then wednesday was tegan and sara at the roxy, and, I don't know, I just... it blows my mind, you know? These are bands we grew up listening to, and now I've got a front- row seat. That's great. We've had our fair share of bands in tree hill, thanks to you. God.Anyway, enough about me. You won a freaking championship! I want to hear everything. Well, whitey's gonna step down as head coach, and he wants me to take over the team. He thinks it'll be good for nathan and... he thinks I'm ready. Luke, that's incredible. I know... I get salary, benefits, and a big office. Wow.That sounds very...adult. I got that song you sent. Oh.You know what? I have something else for you, too. I made you a mix of a bunch of stuff that doesn't street for a couple months. Thank you. I got you something, too.Um... Oh, crap.I'm sorry. - It's work. - Don't answer. They're just gonna keep calling back. Hello. Yeah... right now? Yeah, um, of course I like my job. Okay.Right away, sir. I'm sorry. Can't you at least stay for dessert? Tell you what... how about we have dessert back at my place? Or how about at our room at the beverly hilton? Luke, you did not have to do that. I wanted to. All right.This is gonna be quick.I'll be there by 11:00. - I promise. - All right. Bye. Hey. When did you get here? I don't know.Like an hour ago. You know, you could have, uh... could have woke me up. Luke. What is this? I couldn't bring myself to open it, but I... I've just been sitting here thinking about how much I love you. Well, I wanted it to be a surprise, but, Peyton, I love you, and I want us to be together forever. Luke, wait.Okay. I - I know it's a bit sudden, okay? But, I mean, yesterday was a great day. And I'm sitting on the bus, and I realized none of my great days of my life... matter without you. You're the one I want next to me when my dreams come true, and you're the one I want next to me if they don'T. As long as I have you... nothing else matters. There's... it's just not as simple as all that, okay? There's a lot we have to talk about. I know, but we'll figure out the details when we get back to tree hill. Okay, I know that's home for you, and I miss it sometimes - - I do... but for me, tree hill is two dead moms and a psycho stalker and some really painful memories. I actually had to move out to hollywood to get away from all the drama. So right now, this is my home, and the only thing that's missing is you. Then I'll move here. No.Luke, honey, whitey believes in you, and nathan needs you. And if I ask you to walk away from your dream, you're gonna wake up one day and resent me for it - - the same way I would feel if you asked me to leave L.A. Peyton... you get people coffee and you deliver mail. You were doing more than that in tree hill. Well, I love you for believing that, but I have to prove that to myself. I mean, you see, that's the thing. We both have so much we want to do with our lives, and we're only 19. And nathan and haley were a lot younger than that. Okay.Well, we see how easy that's been. Come on.In another year... peyton... we've seen each other three times in the last year. We go days without talking. We trade few e- mails. We've already grown so far apart. Who knows where we'll be a year from now? Luke, if you can't trust that our love can make it one year, I don't understand how we can be talking about forever right now. You're saying no. No! I... I am not saying no. I'm saying not now. I want to marry you someday. Hey, don't do that.Don't pull away from me, okay? I want us to be together! I love you so much. Just not enough. Okay.Can we take this back? Can we just pretend like you never woke up? Please! I don't think we can. I'm afraid that this conversation is gonna end with... " goodbye. Our dreams are gonna come true, lucas... my music and your novel. It's gonna happen. goodbye, peyton. luke? ...flight to hartford. - hi. - hi I'm sorry to bother you, but I have to get back a little sooner than expected. See what we can do. Thanks. excuse me....one second - Hello. - hi Is this lucas scott? Yeah.Who's this? Uh, my name's lindsey strauss. I'm a junior editor at putnam and pratt. I, uh, read your novel. Well, it's nice of you to call. Everyone else sends their rejection letters first- class. Actually, I loved it. And I passed it on to my boss, and he feels the same way. Hello? No, I - I'm still here. What I'm saying is, we want to publish your book, lucas. How soon can you be in new york? Uh, I'll figure it out. Yeah.Okay.I'm looking forward to seeing you, too. Bye. I need to go to new york. They're publishing my novel. Congratulations. Must be a dream come true. You're all set. Hey, I need you to go on a coffee run. Okay.In a minute. I don't have a minute. Hey. I said I need a minute! Don't get me wrong... the writing's good, but I'm not gonna lie to you. When I found out your father was a convicted murderer - - I mean, that's exactly the kind of hook we need in today's market. I think our newest literary talent needs a drink. When you're done, let's talk about changing that title. What's wrong with the title? They say that about every book. I love the title. "Murder of crows, parliament of owls. " You seem a little young to be an editor. Well, you seem kind of young to have a book being published. Fair enough. The truth is... your novel's my first. I graduated last year. My dad runs the company, but I need to prove myself like everyone else - - maybe more. I know how that is. Luke, I don't care who your father is. I read a lot of manuscripts, but yours was the first one that actually spoke to me. I mean, yeah, there's some rough parts, but your writing has truth, soul. Rough parts? Look, I promise, as your editor, I'll always be faithful to your voice, but there's some work to do. It'll take six months before it's ready for publication - - maybe a little longer. - That long? - Yeah. We're talking late hours, long nights, heated arguments. It'll probably feel like we're married. Th j was aoke. It's just been a long day, that's all. Then you better get some rest, 'cause we start on monday. Hey, lindsey, wait. Um... I just wanted to say thank you for... changing my life. That was all you, lucas. But can I ask you something? Yeah. - The luke and peyton in the novel... - no. I'm sorry. I was rooting for them. See you monday. Excuse me, mr.Scott.There's someone here to see you. She said to tell you she's from tree hill. Well, well.Lucas scott. You got my message. You think I was gonna miss a chance to spend a night on the town with a soon- to- be- best- selling author? God, it is good to see you, brooke. Yeah. So then my mom moved up here with me from L.A. , 'Cause my dad travels so much. I think they should just man up and call it what it is... trial separation. I can't believe your book's gonna be published. You're gonna be such a rock star. Come on.You're the one with the big clothing line. True. But my mom thinks we can do better with that, too. Check this out. It's her plans to take clothes over bro's to the next level. We have high- end couture, a cosmetic company, and my own magazine. B.Davis? Hey, wait. You could give my book its first good review. You know, sometimes expanding seems like a good idea, and... sometimes I don't know. It's the most time I've spent with my mom since the maternity ward, but I'm scared if I let her in, clothes over bro's isn't gonna be mine anymore, you know? Yeah.I know what you mean. There's, uh, this editor girl... uh, lindsey. She just wants to make all these changes to my novel. Pretty high- class problems we got. We should be celebrating, not complaining! Where's peyton? She must be so thrilled for you. We broke up. Shut up. Oh, luke, I'm sorry. What happened? I - I went to L.A., I asked her to marry me, and she All you have in the fridge is vodka. You need to get up. It's time for your Iv. I'm not going anywhere. I'm sorry to wake you up... but I'd like you to explain something. Okay? What do you think this is? Please, come in. Wait a moment. Please close the door. May I? Only my wife and I knew about that. Did the deceased use to sit in this armchair? Turn it around. Will it fit'? Ms. Anna, do you mind getting out of there? Be careful, be careful. Tablecloth? Let's sit down. I'll need the date of death of the deceased. February 16, 2010. Dad, it was '09! .09. If we manage to establish contact, I might start writing very fast. If this happens, I'd like Olga to help me turn the papers. It doesn't happen often, but I might speak in the voice of the deceased. Don't be so nervous. We can slowly begin. Think about Helena. Bring back good memories of her. Let's all join hands. Mr. Janusz, I can feel your skepticism. It won't work unless you open up. I'm sorry, I'm doing my best, but... I'm sorry. Ready? I can't. It was me who wrote it. What'? It was me who wrote the letter from mom and put it in the drawer. It doesn't matter. It's the good intentions that count. This is pointless. To Baum ♪ Harvey ♪ ♪ Harvey ♪ ♪ Harvey ♪ Whoa! I got a bite! I've never caught one before. What do we do with it? Let's keep him as a pet!

It's great hanging out, guys, but I should be heading home now. - Oh, man. - Come on, ask him. Why don't you just spend the night at our place? Great idea, Foo. - Spend the night? - Yeah. You know, like a sleepover. - Yeah! - A sleepover? Dad, can you pick me up? I want to go home. Harvey, you're not calling home again, are you? Glad you could stay over, Harvey. Here, our family brushes - with bubble gum-flavored toothpaste. - Different! My mom only buys the chunky peanut butter. - But you don't care, right? - Different! Oh, you're sick? Well, that's weird, because you weren't feeling sick a couple minutes ago. Yo, Harvey, are... are you crying? Why are you crying? Dad, could you come pick me up? Harvey. Harvey! - Harvey! - Huh?

Yeah, silverware. - Can't talk, packing! - You know, Son, eventually you're gonna have to stop packing - and just go. - I know. I just want everything to be perfect. - Are these the nicest plates we have? - Honey, I think it's great that you're stepping outside of your comfort zone. Yep, your mom and I are very proud of... Son, don't pack the egg. But what if I need it? Son, you know, you don't have to spend the night. Oh, no, I have to. Listen, Dad, we both know my history with sleepovers. But this time it's gonna be different, because this time, - I know I'm gonna... - You know, just in case. Ha! Come on, I don't need that phone anymore. Okay, if you're sure, I'll put it back in the drawer. That is, uh, unless you want me to have it. - Sure, Son, take it for my sake. - Thanks, Dad. Fee, Foo, I'm here for the sleepover! Hmm, I guess they're not home. - Well, I best be on my way... - Harvey, we'll be right down. We just have to finish up some business. Whoa. Okay, we're all done. Really glad we finally got you over for a sleepover. - Yeah. - Yeah, me too. So this is cool. This is where we're gonna spend all night. Yep, all night. All the way till morning. Yeah-huh. Where's your bathroom? Oh, wow. Oh, I'll just hold it until I get home. - So what should we do first, Harvey? - Uh, well, let's see. Oh, I've got this magazine that has a list of fun sleepover activities. Some people think these magazines are only for girls, but they're not. Activity one... paint each other's nails. Fee, do you have any nail polish? - No. - Aw! Okay, guess we're not doing that one. Ah, here we go. Pink Sherries. - What's that? - It's lemon-lime soda with a splash of my secret ingredient. - Cool. - Ah, thanks, Harvey. This is fun, guys. I'm gonna make a quick phone call. - Cool, a phone. - What? You always gotta prank call someone at a sleepover. Hello. Luigi's Pizza. What can I get you? Pizza? Hey, Miriam, did you want pizza? Um, yeah. That sounds kind of good, actually. Hi, we'll take a large, uh... - Do you guys have any specials right now? - Uh... He wants the pizza. What do I do? - I don't know. - Uh, you better go catch it. Got him good. Your turn, Harvey. - Oh, no, thanks. I don't think I could. - Oh, it's easy. You just hit a bunch of numbers until you hear a voice. Order now, and we'll send you the full DVD set. Oh, my! Ahem. Yes? Hello? - Uh, uh... - Hello? Hello? This phone's not really for that. Hello! Hello? Hello. Prank calls are fun and all, but this is Harvey's first sleepover. - We need to pull a real prank. - Uh, okay. Cool. Why are we going to Fog Bark? Why not just prank someone in Littlebark? 'Cause you don't dump where you eat, Harvey. Oh, look, a phone! Well, a quick call to Dad wouldn't hurt. Sorry Harvey couldn't make it, guys. I guess he's just never gonna grow up. Hey, I found someone to prank. That guy. Uh, how about... that guy? Aw, but he looks so peaceful. Yeah, I know. Watch this. Here, Harvey, tickle his face with this. Do it! Do it! Do it! Well, Harvey, you wanted a sleepover. Whoo! Dude, that was so classic. You're the master of comedy. Yeah, that was actually pretty fun. I'm glad you guys asked me to come for a sleepover. Maybe we could do this every night. I mean, I'd have to talk to my mom about it, of course. Is it morning? Did I make it? Oh, guess not. - Where are we? - Why are we tied up? Guys, look, the exit! Let's go! Oh, the monster! Run back, run back, run back! - Okay, time to think of a new plan. - Hey, what's he doing? Kind of looks like he's building a fire. Actually, it looks like he's kind of sharpening something, - some kind of giant, sharp knife. - And now it looks like he's putting down a picnic blanket and laying out a plate setting. Well, let's put our heads together. Why would he tie us up, start a fire, and sharpen a giant, sharp... Oh, my gosh, he's gonna eat us. What? - Let's get out of here! - I got it. You can use your phone. - My phone? - Yeah. Call your dad. - He'll come pick us up. - I-I can't call him. This is a sleepover, and I'm gonna make it to the morning. Harvey, none of us are gonna make it to the morning unless you call your dad. - Yeah, Harvey! Call your dad! - No, I can't. I don't need to. Everything was going so great. Harvey, I get it. I know you wanted to make it through a whole sleepover. And you got pretty far, but now, you gotta call it quits. Come on, Harvey. You can do this. You're right, Fee. I can do this. Hello? Hello, sir. This is Luigi's Pizza. - Is he... - Doing a prank call? And I'd like to order a, uh... I, um... our specials... um, is your refrigerator running? I don't know how to do this! Let's just run! Run! Harvey, our tree is this way. Where are you going? I'm going home! Whew! Whatever. Wha... Huh? I'm sorry you couldn't make it through your sleepover, pal. I know you thought this time would be different. You can always try it again some other time. Actually, Dad, I'm just here to give you this. You know, I don't think I need it anymore. That's right, Foo, fill mine up all the way to the top. I can't believe Harvey went home. Yeah, it's all very sad, and that makes me sad. To the sleepover that never happened. To Harvey. Wait! Make me one of those Pink Sherries. Harvey! You're back! - Good to see ya, pal. - Okay, let's get back to our sleepover. There's still a bunch of activities we could do. Oh, here's one. - Truth or Dare. - Oh, dare me to paint my fingernails. Truth... I ate that whole jar of cherries. Huh. Oh, you guys... Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Let's pick up the pace. I only got ten minutes. Okay, kids? Go play in that ditch or something. Mommy's working. Welcome to your final babysitting certification class. I will be going around and grading each of you on your ability to care for the practice baby dolls I assigned you last week. Also, I've had four minutes of sleep since Tuesday. - What you got for me? - Okay, so I know it looks broken, because it is, but stairs are really tricky. Listen, sweetie, rule number one, your baby needs to at least survive. - Sorry, can't certify you. - Oh, of course. All right, Dade. Where's your practice baby? It's right here in the safe space I made to protect it from evil. And look, these headphones, they play calming clarinet music. I play the clarinet. Hey, how'd those things get in there? Mackenzie, Taylor, you put Mr. Dade's baby down right now! Okay, Harvey, I've got literally 30 seconds left. Go. Following is a dramatization I've prepared to demonstrate the skills I will bring as a babysitter. I hope you enjoy. I shall now change this diaper! Hooah! Hooah! Hoo! Hoo! Oh, wow! Yeah! Thank you. Thank you. I learned that from an audiobook. Fantastic, Harvey. That's all I need to see. That's it? But I haven't even gotten to the food preparation yet. J-Just take the badge, sweetie. I solemnly swear my oath to bear. I keep my ward within my sight and guard them through the darkest night. - Dude, everyone left already. - Oh, really? Okay. Guys, look at this cool badge. Now, I'm basically an adult. The baby has now become the babysitter. I'm a man! Mom, Dad, look at me! Do you guys notice anything different about me? - Um... - Oh, um, you got a haircut. Nope. It's, uh, something else. - Uh, your head got smaller. - No. - Oh, you're wearing contacts! - I'm a certified babysitter! Oh, sweetie, we're so proud of you. - Way to go, Harvey. - You know, it just so happens that we need a babysitter tonight. Right, dear? We do? Oh, that's right, we do. We're, uh... we're going to that, uh, the swamp... a swamp party with fire dancers, fire people... fire people. We're all... We're all gonna wear funny, little hats. So do you think you could babysit for your sister tonight? Really? Tonight? I won't let you guys down. I'll keep my ward within my sight and guard her through the darkest night. A swamp party, really? Hey, little sis, guess what. Little sis? Ha, how'd you get under there? Mom and Dad are trusting me to take care of you all by myself. Now, you're gonna have to be in bed by 7:00. But trust me, we're gonna have a blast before then. All right, dear, we're just about ready to go. Oh, hey, Jeremy. Are you going to hang out with Mom and Dad? No, sweetie, you're going to babysit your sister, - and Jeremy is here to babysit you. - Hi! Wait, what? But I'm the babysitter. You two have fun now. Okay, well, I don't know what my mom was thinking - getting two babysitters. - So what do you want to do first? I actually have a pretty full itinerary planned for egg and me tonight. We're gonna play educational board games. Oh, here, let me help you up. Up you go. No, no, no, no, no. Um, Jeremy, Warriors of Warsville is really a two-person game. Hmm, that game seems a little too adult for kids. How about Blocky Builders? All right, Sis, who's ready for some snacks? Now that I'm basically a grown-up, I can use Dad's apple slicer. Whoosh, did somebody say applesauce? Open up, Harvey. Yummy plane is coming in for a landing. Whoosh. Gee, Meredith, babysitting you all by myself has taught me the real meaning of Independence Day. Jeremy, would you join me in the kitchen? Oh, okay. Would you like a drink? I take you for an orange juice man. Oh, oh, yeah. If I drink milk, bad things happen. Let me level with you. I don't really think we need two babysitters. I mean, I'm certified. - Are you certified? - Uh, well... And how much supervision do I really need? I'm nine. I think you should go home, get some rest, - and let me do my job. - Oh, you're doing a great job, and I'm having fun babysitting, too. - Now, let's go watch another movie. - But... Hey, Harvey. - Look at these ants. - It's pretty remarkable. How's the babysitting going? Jeremy's stepping into my territory. How am I supposed to prove I can handle babysitting if he's around? Sorry, dude. Too bad he's an adult, otherwise I could punch him. Foo, go put those outside. Remember how Harvey's dad screamed last time? Okay. - Ha ha! Locked you out. - Good one. Wait a second. That gives me an idea! Hey, Jeremy, could you help me take out this trash? I'd do it myself, but my little child arms are too weak. Oh. Oh, dear. Oh, wait, did he say this was recycling? - What's up? - Foo farted, but you can't tell because of the garbage. Wait, what? Oh! Oh! Oh, no, it's locked! I'm sorry, Jeremy. I think we both know this isn't working. Wait, wait. I promised your parents I'd watch you. I'm a good babysitter, and I don't need your help. Egg, you just stay put. I'll be right back. Who is it? Uh, it's your parents. We're back. - Jeremy, is that you? - Yeah. Give it up, Jeremy! This house only needs one babysitter. Whoa! I'm sorry, but I need to show my parents that I'm a responsible, rational person. Oh, it's in my eyes! Oh, no! Egg! Don't worry! I'm coming! Oh, no. No, no, don't jump. Oh, Harvey, wait! - Fee, Foo, the egg escaped! - Look, we built a garbage fort. - I think Harvey wants us to help. - Oh, okay. Whoa! I'm coming! No! We're coming, Egg! Oh, no. Okay. Okay, just... just suck it in. Whoa, we're in Hot Bark Springs. Look, over there! Little sis! - Whoa! - Watch it! Nooo! Oh, goodness. Don't fall, don't fall, don't fall, don't fall! Hold it right there. You're both tracking dirt everywhere. I'm gonna clean you two whether you like it or not. Harvey, they're taking us away. It's okay. I can save the egg on my own. Oh, oh. Ow! Harvey! Nobody panic. This is official babysitter business. - Ow! - Ow! - Dr. Roberts. - Ah, hello, child. I'm just lathering my earthly vessel. How are you? My sister just fell on your head. Could you hand her over? Of course. I knew I felt something blocking my dream chakra. Oh, man, that was close. Little sis, now that I've got you, I'm never letting you go. Whoops. Why are you so slippery? I just remembered, I'm covered in oil. No! Egg, stay still! Oh, Harvey, let me help. Jeremy, no! Go home! I can handle this. Wow, okay. That is boiling. Ow, ow, ow. The Super Hot Springs! She'll hard-boil if she stays in there. What the... No kids allowed unless accompanied by an adult? But I'm a good kid. I can't break the rules! Oh, my goodness. Harvey, do you need my help? No, I can... I... Yes. We've combined! Let's go. Oh, it's so hot. Oh, I have rosacea. We did it! You're okay now, Sis. Thanks for helping me, Jeremy. I just really wanted to show my mom and dad that I'm responsible enough to do everything on my own, but I guess I'm not. Here, I don't deserve this badge. But, Harvey, part of being responsible is admitting when you need help. I need help with a lot of things, like making phone calls sometimes or, you know, putting on pants. - You did the right thing. - Oh, thanks. You know what? Here, now we're both certified. Wow! We're great babysitters. synccorrectionbyf1nc0 - Previously on Complications... - I'm trying to stop folks from killing each other. John, you're really telling me you went to the PT wing during the busiest shift of the year to give yourself an antibiotic shot? Yes. Well, it was only for a minute. John, do you have any idea how serious this is? Bridget, I... I promise I will explain everything. If you've lied to me and you go out there tonight and the shootings start again, you and I are gonna have a problem. Enough people died tonight. I'd say you're working for one of the most dangerous gangs in Atlanta. Unless you have an explanation... I developed a substance-abuse issue. Call Bridget O'Neill. I believe he was abusing morphine. - Hey, what's going on? - It's bad. It's only a matter of time before they realize we stole a bunch of shit. That cannot happen. You need to go back in there and get rid of anything that leads back to us, Jed. The hospital is looking for anything irregular. They're gonna come after me and Jed, and we're gonna get caught. Gretch! You're being paranoid. Jed, what the hell is going on? - I'm in County. - What? Jed! _ Thanks for meeting me here. Trying to get out as much as possible while this weather holds. Wes, what the hell did you get me into? Wow. You suck at small talk. Just order a drink, ask me about my weekend. How about I ask you about these patients? Which ones? The patients I referred to you. None of the clinics you work with gave them so much as an aspirin. Well, I'll look into it. Must have fallen through the cracks. Then how is it that they still got billed for a shit-ton of treatments that never happened? This guy got charged for a new hip and a wheelchair last week. You know what's strange? He came into the E.D. this morning to pick up his psych meds and walked right in. Okay, Florence Nightingale, slow your roll. No one is hurting these people. You seriously think a bunch of homeless guys and senile grandmas care if we stick their name on an invoice and send it to Medicare? That is not the point. I referred them because I thought they were getting help. You referred them so you'd get money. I did not know that this whole thing was a scam. Sure, you thought it was totally legit. You know, Cal told me about you. The whole "bad girl goes straight and becomes a nurse" thing. Very inspiring. If they ever make a TV movie about you, I'm watching. But look around, Gretch. Every single one of these assholes is cheating on their wives, ripping off their shareholders, and lying to the IRS. It is how they got here. I don't give a shit. You earned this. Take it. Seriously? You're gonna be like this? Hey, tell me, how is the whole "being an angel" thing working out for you? Huh? You're sharing a crappy studio apartment with a bunch of roommates and can't get custody of your sister and driving a broken-down piece of shit. I'm presenting you with an opportunity. You keep the patient records coming, and these envelopes will just get thicker. Gretchen, I'm dying in here. I'm losing my shit. What do they have on you? Okay, they're claiming I took some patient records. They're charging me with health-care fraud. They also found drugs in my desk. They allegedly found drugs in my desk. How bad is it? They say I could get ten years. But the thing is, the, um... public defender said the prosecutor might be willing to make a deal if I... If what? If I turned in my associate from the hospital. Your... your associate would feel pretty betrayed. Look, Gretchen, I know. I... I would feel awful. But I can't do ten years. So that's it? You're just gonna take that deal? No. No, okay, there might be another way. You remember when Bobby Pratt got busted for selling those Dilaudids to that undercover cop? I talked to the lawyer that got him off. He thinks he can help me out. Only thing is... What? He's expensive. You know, you really do not need to come tonight. You're giving a speech, John. I wouldn't miss it. Uh... _ Um, I'm just gonna go, um, make sure that Oliver's squared away, okay? Okay, I'll be down in a minute. This is not a good time. Yeah, well, it's a worse time here. What is it? Where are you? Do you remember Jed from Medical Records? - He's in jail. - What happened? He did something stupid, and if we don't get him a very expensive lawyer right now, we're screwed. How expensive? 30 grand. Jesus, Gretchen, what makes you think I can get that kind of money together? Oh, I don't know... your huge house, your nice Mercedes. No, I got everybody watching me. I got the police, Bridget, my wife. We're gonna have to find another way to get the money. I might have a guy that can help us out, but... But? But what? But you don't just get 30 grand in cash on a few days' notice without having to work for it. We'll talk tomorrow, Doctor. Hey, are you okay? You look a little nervous. I'm fine. It's just public speaking, you know? Yeah. Oh, you didn't tell me Bridget was coming. I haven't seen her in ages. Uh, you know what? Let's, um... Let's talk to Helen first. She's running the event, and I just want to get squared away for the speech. Okay. There he is, the man of the hour. - So good to see you. - The new wing is stunning. - Congratulations. - It's been a long time coming. We really appreciate you being here for this. It's no problem. So I'm just gonna grab some water from the bar before we get started... Can I get you anything? Uh, sure, a glass of Cab. That's the purple one, right? Excuse me. Uh, a glass of Cabernet, please, and a water. - I know we need to talk. - Police called about you. What the hell is going on? I can explain everything, and I will explain everything tomorrow. But for now, please, let's just keep this between us. - Samantha's here and... - I am not lying for you. The situation is not what it looks like, I swear. - Bridget O'Neill. - Thank you. - You look amazing. - Sam. Did you get called in for that gang shooting last night too? Yeah, it was a rough one. Ladies and gentlemen... Ooh, sounds like they want to get started. - We should go find our table. - Okay. - See you soon. - Okay. Including state-of-the-art equipment and ten more beds in the inpatient medical surgical unit. I was asked to speak here tonight not just as a doctor, but also as a father who had a patient here in the pediatric wing. Two years ago, my daughter was diagnosed with acute lymphoid leukemia. Hearing that news was the hardest day of my life, because when your child is sick, your universe stops, and all you want to do is to make them better and to ease their pain. And that's what this place does. As doctors, we have many tools. We do ours job with medicine and technology but most of all, with a compassion of professionals who fight to understand the pain and challenges of other human beings. So, when I think of this facility, I think of it as a place to come together as doctors. I think of a place that makes that fight a little easier, when a little easier means the world. Thank you. Ollie, are you coming down? Hey, before I forget, how does pizza sound for your sleepover? Ben doesn't eat pizza. What kind of an 11-year-old boy doesn't eat pizza? His mom doesn't believe in dairy. We're talking about cheese, not the tooth fairy. Excuse me, Mrs. Ellison? - Can I talk to you for a sec? - Sure, what's up? You've been so nice bringing us coffee and all. I just wanted to give you a heads-up. This is our last day out here. I'm not even supposed to be here now. What? Did something happen? All I know is somebody downtown pulled the detail. Well, then who made that decision? It's way above my pay grade, ma'am. I should go. Real sorry about this. Hey, how are you doing? Okay. I'm driving Ollie to school. Where are you? I'm, uh, at a meeting. Is something wrong? Did you hear anything about the police taking away the car in front of our house? No. They did? Yeah, I just talked to the officer. He said the decision was made downtown. I'm thinking we should probably call over there. You know, that's probably not a good, um... idea. Really? Why not? Um... Uh... John? Oh, you know what it probably is? Our alarm system is hooked up to the police station, and they probably just figured, you know, we're... we're... We're covered now. Listen, I... I should go. We'll be fine. - I'll talk to you later. - Okay, bye. Hey, buddy, how you doing? Uh, do me a favor, keep the car running... Okay, just remember that this is the guy that's helping us get the money that we need. So keep an open mind, okay? Dr. John Ellison. Gretchen sings your praises. I'm Wes. Yeah, I um... Yeah, nice to meet you. Always like making new friends. Mm. Okay, come on in. Let's do this inside. I work with medical facilities in the greater Atlanta area. So are you a physician or... Eh, not exactly. More of an entrepreneur. A few years back, I was actually thinking hospital administration, but turns out, I'm allergic to red tape. Hmm. Mm. So Gretchen says you got some sort of business proposal. Yes, sure thing. So I supply folks in the medical community with products that they can't obtain... or can't obtain for the right price. This clinic I'm working with up in Sandy Springs, we're looking to get our hands on some doxorubicin. Well, uh, I know some pharmaceutical reps. I could probably get you a... a discount. That's the thing. Um, I'm looking for a steeper discount than I could get from a pharmaceutical rep. As medical professionals, I figure you two might be able to, uh, you know, find some that wouldn't be missed. You want us to steal drugs for you? Relax and keep your voice down. No need to get worked up. The bottom line here is this... We're supplying medicine to patients who need it. Sick folks get their meds. Gretchen's friend stays out of the Georgia State Prison System. Everyone's happy. Just take a moment and think about our... I don't need to think about it. We're done here. You know, John, I don't love your tone. Go to hell. We need 30 grand. What did you think this was gonna be? Less horrible. I am not stealing chemotherapy medication. Yeah, well, it's that, or you sell your car. Is there no line for you? This isn't just for me. We are helping people. My daughter died of leukemia. I know. That's why I thought you would do this. Cancer drugs are going to cancer patients. - Who cares exactly... - No! Just... no. There has to be a line somewhere. Hey. Wasn't sure you'd actually show up. We need to talk. You're damn right we do. First off, I want to thank you for last night. Skip the thank-yous. We both know what I have to do here. If our roles were reversed and you found out that I had an issue with drugs... I don't have an issue with drugs. That night with all the gang members in the E.D., I... I think I had a bit of PTSD or something. You expect me to buy that? No, I'm telling you, I was having an anxiety attack. And I didn't want the rest of the staff to see so I snuck off to the PT room, and I gave myself some Propranolol to calm myself down. Then what about the morphine vial I found? I don't know. Wasn't mine. I swear to you. I want to believe you, but I just can't. With everything that's happened with you lately, I have to tell LaToya about this. Please. Just hang on. Um, what are you doing? Test my blood. You won't find a trace of morphine. - That's crazy. I can't just... - Come on. We've been friends a long time. Jesus. This isn't about friendship. Just run a tox screen before you ruin my life. That's all I ask. Fine. Topanga. - Topanga. - I want you to change it. Okay. Previously on Powers... - Outer Banks Patrol Division. - What was that like? Some Power gets out of hand, policy was leave 'em the fuck alone. We don't leave them the fuck alone here. Iron Impact, ladies and gentlemen. Shit! Yeah. What... Krispin? Kill any more Powers? I was a Power, Krispin. You were a hero, Walker. That's different from just being a Power. He hooked Olympia up with a girl. Got her to pass him some Sway. Whatever was in this envelope, was also in his bloodstream. You hooked up with Retro Girl? I know everything about her. What was that? Johnny Royalle. Everyone says Royalle is dead. Okay, Wolfe ate Royalle. What happened to Royalle? He was right there, and then he went away. Christian. You can have everything back. Just get me out of here. "You can have them all back?" My powers! He has my fucking powers! You don't belong here. Little Wannabe. Let's get out of here. Shit. Christian. You stupid son of a bitch. Hey! Diamond? Walker? You okay? Albert? I thought that was you, Diamond. Hey, don't call me that, okay? Oh, sure. Sure. You okay? Uh... Yeah. Yeah. I, uh... Was she here? You guys see each other? Are you getting back together? No, nothing like that. Boy, it was exciting back then. You and her flying through the night sky together, keeping us safe. She doesn't come up here much anymore. Not since... Appreciate all you did for us, Albert. You were a good friend. It was a pleasure. Need me to call you a cab? No, I have my car down there somewhere. Yeah. You take care. Sure. You come up here anytime you want, Diamond. I got your back. These things are gonna kill me. Something's gonna kill you. Six months to retirement, like you're wearing crosshairs. You too old for this shit, Adlard? Oh, shut up. What's goin' on with Olympia? Still dead. Some red shit mixed in with his DNA has Dr. Death all spazzed out. He was poisoned? Or maybe some new Powers drug. Shit. Superstar gonna show up or what? You don't want to wait for him, don't wait for him. SOP is we wait for Walker. By the popsicles. Zerotron loves those popsicles. You ever serve a Powers warrant? Nope. When we go, move fast, hit hard, keep hitting. Shit. He's moving. Fucking Walker. We can't take him on the street. Too much metal. Let's fly the colors. Keep your spacing! Pilgrim, don't pull ahead! Hold the fucking line! I didn't do nothing! Just leave me the fuck alone or I'll zap you to shit! Easy, Zerotron, easy. You can't ride the lightning! Go! He's gonna arc! No, no, no! Don't do that! Let's tape this asshole's eyes shut before he wakes up. If you can't get your leading man here, at least don't fuck up the show. Damn it. Fuck. The caller you have dialed is unavailable. Hey, it's me. Um... I... We need to talk. Um... Call me. It's Christian. Shit. The caller you have dialed is unavailable. Me again. We need to talk about the girl. Um, she's a witness. So, it's official shit. Call me. Shit. I'll see the supplier. We'll make more tonight. Thank you. Does the girl know where it comes from? No. You sure? Calista is not a threat. We should talk to... However dangerous or benign she is, she is my concern. Thank you. I am not your personal assistant. What's in your ass this morning? Zerotron-X. Oh, shit. Where is he now? Are the guys tailing him? He's in custody. What the fuck? What happened? How'd it go down? I drew a little current. You charged in didn't you? You're gonna get somebody killed. I'm tellin' you. I'm gonna... Jesus. Where were you, Mr. Essential Personnel? I was working the fucking case. You were working the fucking case? I was working the fucking case, and I saw Calista last night. What the... Where is she? Retro Girl has her. How did that happen? Calista jumped off the Tower, and Retro Girl caught her. What the fuck? I know. The girl jumped off the Tower because she thought it might give her powers. It did not. So how do we go about finding Retro Girl? I left a message on her personal line. Her personal line? Okay. Yeah, hopefully she'll call me back. Does she usually call back right away, or... I haven't called in a very long time, and you can stop with the questions, please. I kind of have to ask a question. Do we have to wait for her to call you back or do you know where she lives? I know where she lives. Can you please stop that? This is the wrong tie. I had these lucky ties. They were exactly the right length. I had a dozen of them made when I took off the mask, but only have one left and I can't find it. It's fine. You look great. Is there something I should know before meeting Retro Girl? We're not going to Retro Girl's. What? You're gonna take a left on Franklin. Olympia's widow? You think she had something to do with his death? Fuck no. Yeah, whenever I heard "fuck no" back in Sheriff's, I always looked closer. Deena, please... Yeah, he turns up dead cheating on his wife. She's not that kind of wife. He was always such a little boy at heart. He was charming. I was a studious girl. Real high school sweethearts, huh? And when he changed, I thought it would change him. Grow him up, you know, having all that power. But instead he stopped growing altogether. Why change when everyone loves you exactly the way you are? Even if what you are is a 16-year-old boy in a man's body. So what he was doing the night he died, that was nothing new. Well, I made a point of not knowing the details, but if he died licking coke off the tits of a groupie while her friend gave him a rim job, then, yes, that was nothing new for my husband. No, marriage is hard. Forty years of it, nearly impossible. Boy we banged some good times, though. Back in the '70s, we pretty much fucked anything that moved. We smoked it, we drank it and we snorted it. Hell, yeah, times were different then. But they couldn't last. Are you sure I can't offer either one of you a little eye opener? No, thanks. No, no. Uh... It wasn't groupies last night, Lenore. He was with a girl. Young. Jesus shit, how young? Do you think she had anything... No. Maybe. He say anything lately? A special girl he was into? A place? He's been hitting a new underground place. One of those pop-ups. Lots of young ass. No place for an old lady. Um... Here and Gone. To my husband, Olympia. The best lay in the world. Here and Gone. Uh-huh. You got that hottie's number? Yeah, Zora. I saw her last night. Jesus, Walker. Nothing happened. And I know where to find her. Just drive the car. I'm really sorry, Krispin. I hate that word, grief. It even sounds depressing. Like some great big weight you can't wait to put down.

I remember when you did that. You weren't born when I did that. I used to watch your Powers That Be top hits with my mom. That was October 28th, 1982. Capricious Scream attacked you when you were on patrol. Revenge, 'cause you put Bloody Marky in the Shaft. Well, Capricious Scream attacked me during a press event, so that she could get her face in front of the cameras before she launched her naughty little lingerie line. Oh. Did Walker take you up there? I like the original costume best. The miniskirt and the go-go boots. Hmm. Well, I only wore it in action once. I punched Helix Rize and my boob popped out. Every time I fought him after that, he called me super tits. This is awesome. Hanging out with you, it's awesome. We are not hanging out. I caught you as you were falling at terminal velocity. And I did so without breaking your neck, which was hard. Now normally, I would have taken you to the hospital, but you were falling in the arms of a man with whom I share an incredibly complicated history. And you were dressed like me, which made me wonder if something very fucked up was happening between the two of you. No, nothing like that. I was with Olympia when he died. Walker was kind of chasing me, I guess. You wanna get the girl now, or... You get her. I need to speak to my publicist. Did you find that reporter? Yes. She's psyched. Well, then I'm about to become very exposed indeed. We open tonight. Put the word out to the Powerz Kidz. I want them to know they have a place here. No more foundlings, my friend. Everything okay? You feel like you know me? Yeah, better than most. What's wrong? I don't know. Hmm, "Zora." You're popular. Okay, I showed you the pop-up club, can I go now? Got some heavy duty hanging out to do? You don't even know. I could drop you in the shit so fucking fast. Was that a threat? Huh? Are you high? Oh, you on that new red shit? I don't get high. I'm a Power. You can't imagine what that feels like. And you've forgotten. No, I haven't. Being young and powerful, it feels like you could save the whole world if everybody would just stay out of your way. Oh, shit. Walker? Hey, Zora, the guy who runs the pop-ups... Pale? Skinny? Yeah. Get out of here. What the fuck? She's got nothing to do with this. How do you know she's got nothing... I... Get out of here. Go. Is it... Jesus! It's naked. We got that part. Not naked of clothing Detective Pilgrim, naked of physical evidence. There is roughly 24 hours' worth of dust on this body. Other than that, there are no dead skin cells on this body. The millions of infinitesimal particles and microbes that occupy the surface of the human skin are all but absent. As if a great wind has blown it clean. What did this? Nothing. Nothing? Until you can prove the existence of a blade of infinite thinness, one that can cleave perfectly between molecules, I will maintain that nothing created that wound. Lasers. Lasers generate heat. You will observe an absence of burns. Okay, so... Forced to guess, I'd have to assume that a portal from an alternate dimension briefly occupied the physical space that once contained this man's head. Can you get an ID off his prints? It has no prints. The impossible implement that removed its head, has achieved a similar feat with its finger prints. Dental records will also be problematic. You know what I like? Talking? Guns. I like how guns kill people by shoving a bullet through their flesh leaving a trail of evidence a mile long. So, did you notice how we found a dead body in the club where Olympia was partying? Before he turned up dead himself, I mean. Look, that's another dead body connected to Calista. I told you, Retro Girl didn't return my call. Life is complicated, but you gotta get over that. What Calista knows or saw could turn this whole thing on its head. Fuck it, let's go. Take the Mint Street on-ramp. Okay. So how did you meet Olympia? At a club. There's an app, Power Seekers, where people tag the spots that Powers hang out. And you were just... I went up to him, and he liked me, and he took me home. And you were wearing that? Yeah. How come you don't fight villains anymore? It's like you talk about things that need to be fixed. Come here for a moment. Hurricane Pulp. It's going to make landfall within the next 48 hours. Thousands will die, and there's nothing I can do to stop that. But when the storm hits, I'll be there saving as many lives as I can. One at a time. Because as powerful I am, I still have only two hands. Now you tell me, why were you on that roof? Walker took me. He said that you hang out there. I guess he was trying to impress me or something. Get me to talk about Olympia. But he got all worked up when I didn't say anything and he pushed me. And I fell and he tried to grab me, and we both fell. That's the truth. Excuse me. There are detectives at the gate. Please just have them wait in my office. Thank you, Eva. Come with me. You'll be safe outside until they're gone. Yeah. You are one Powers pwning motherfucker. Uh, thanks. Except now everyone on the server is out to kill me. Or not. What? Did you do that? Eh, I got skills. Are you going on missions or just messing around? I'm looking for Iron Impact. Oh, he's not in this update. They took him out after he killed that cop. You know what they didn't get right in this game? No regular people die. You know, like a Power demolishes a school. All the kids get out. A Power crashes a plane, no dead bodies in the wreckage. It's bullshit. Yeah. I mean, I know people who have, you know, lost people. I mean, my cousin was, you know... So, you want to go stomp the crap out of Iron Impact? I thought you said they took him out. I got a work around for it. I've been waiting for you to call. I left a message. Oh, really? Hmm. No, no one told me. On the number that I used to... The old number. I don't use that number anymore. Well, I left a message on it. Well, not for me. I'm Detective Pilgrim. Yeah, uh... I assume you work with him. How do you do? Yes, right, I do. Good to meet you, ma'am. Oh, ma'am. Not that you look like one I just... You grew up with me. Yeah. Well, the entire world grew up with me, Detective. We need the girl. Well, she says that you pushed her off that tower. No, she's lying. She jumped. Well, no, no, I know she's lying. I've spent all day listening to her lies and waiting for you to either call or come by. Here we are. Yes, indeed. So, she jumped? Yeah, look, we need to talk to her. It's important. Hang on, hang on, hang on. She jumped. And you did what? Because when I caught her, she was hanging onto you. You jumped too, Christian. The kid went over. I wanted to save her. I felt like, I felt like maybe I could. So, is the girl here or not? Because if she's here, we'd like to get on with our job. Shit. Where is she? There's nowhere for her to go. It's Royalle! Royalle is alive. I think. I think he had something to do with Olympia. And the girl knows. That's why we need her. ♪ You live in a place long, long ago ♪ Krispin. Hey, Krispin. Hey. Hey, Mom. How was going back to school? It's okay. The usual school. How was work? Good. I could use a new client or two, but... It's good to see you drawing. Can I peek? It's not done yet. Okay.

Call me when you get a chance. Shit. Hey, it's Walker. Hey, it's me again. Um... I'm calling about the girl and Royalle. And that's why I called, all right? Ha! I need you to be really professional. What? He has no wants or warrants. He has not been charged with anything. He is simply filling out a Use Of Powers Certificate. "Describe the parameters of your power in terms of range, "tensile strength, watts, volts, pounds per square inch." We cannot touch him. "Max speed, max altitude or any other similar "or dissimilar units of measure that may apply." You remember when we didn't have to do any of this? Nobody cared how far or how fast you could fly. It was enough that you were up there. Ten years changes everything. Johnny Royalle. Christian, you look... Well... Your tie, it's askew. I'm here to register my powers as law demands not to defend myself or flee. Here and Gone, motherfucker. Stop. Walker, you can let him go. He's alive, uh? You were right. You were right. You're happy to see me then, huh? Where's Calista? Is that really what you want to know after all these years? I'm just asking because I find it odd that you're so concerned about another person. She's a kid, John. Where is she? Please. Wonders never cease. May we go now? Or should I start the lawsuits immediately? Calista is fine, Christian. All she needs is a home and a family. You remember what that was like, don't you? Who killed Johnny Royalle? I suppose the truth is I killed Johnny Royalle. Why? Because I couldn't live with him any longer. Let's not be coy now. You are Johnny Royalle. So, what? You couldn't live with the fact that you broke Wolfe out of the Shaft, and he killed hundreds of people? I did not break Wolfe out of the Shaft. Wolfe literally disappeared from his cell, and it is common knowledge that you were his chief disciple. I was a student of Wolfe's. Myself, several other young Powers, were taken by his philosophy of Powers Complete. This man in whom I placed my trust, whom I loved, he killed, literally ate, all of my closest friends. I did not break him out. Well, if you're not guilty, then why kill Johnny Royalle? Your DNA was found amongst the remains at the terrace. Why fake your own death? In the face of universal loathing, who wouldn't want to be Johnny Royalle? In the face of universal loathing, why resurrect him? This city is my home. I wanted to come home. I wanted to make something here. A house of sorts. A safe place. A celebration, if you will. Your resistance to Powers registration landed you in the Shaft yourself. A political prisoner. Will you register? Just because you disagree with a law, doesn't mean you get to ignore it. I'll be registering today. Johnny Royalle did in fact register his powers shortly after this interview. And here's a look at the reception he received. I'm here to register my powers as law demands. I am not using my powers to defend myself or flee... Will you stop it? Okay, okay. So, when is he gonna make his move for Wolfe? He should have done it already. None of this publicity shit. He's planning something. I just... I can't... Fuck this cop shit. Give me something I can hit. I'm gonna ask you a question. Can you for once... Did you know? ...just not... No. When you jumped, did you know Retro Girl was gonna save you? Yes, I knew. I did. I knew because she was gonna be on patrol... Mmm-hmm. Because the lords and the outlaws had been on her turf that morning. I knew because... Fuck you. I don't know what I knew, okay. Calista jumped. I went after her. It was a stupid fucking thing to do, okay. I don't have powers anymore. I'm not a hero. Thank you, I know. No! That shit... You know what I think? That shit, that jump off a building and save a kid shit, that's not because you were a Power, that's because you're you. You can learn the cop shit, Walker. Oh. Mmm. It's Dr. Death. Dead naked guy's name was Gomez Pugh. If you can believe it. The Power. Went by the handle... Yeah. Bug. That's him. You know what Dr. Death found in his DNA? Little red corkscrews? Just like Olympia. Yeah. Royalle. It's gotta be. Oh, it's gotta be Royalle. What is he doing? It's gonna take some cop shit to figure it out. Yeah. Don't get used to it. I'm not your personal assistant. Tell me about Zerotron-X. I charged in. No, no. Rookie mistake. Rookie mistake. What? That... You made yourself into a lightning rod. Okay. See, lightning has multiple targets, splits out... All right! Sweet, thanks. Ladies and Gentlemen, the mysterious owner of the Here and Gone club, Johnny Royalle. So you found me. You were easy to find. You're all over the internet. You're Johnny Royalle. You're famous. And yet, I'm still myself. So, where did you run to? I did something stupid, and, um... Retro Girl saved me. So you met your hero, hmm? What did you think of her? I trusted her. She said she would hide me, but she lied. She was gonna give me to the cops. Do you trust me? Did you kill Bug? This place, no one knows where it is. Not even Simons. We are invisible. I killed Bug. I killed him, in part, because he misused you. This is my signed confession. If I ever betray your trust, you take this to Walker. I put my freedom in your hands. Let's go back to the party. I'll show you your new home. Hey, it's me. Call me when you get a chance. Hey, it's me again, um. I'm calling about the girl and Royalle. And that's why I called. Hi, it's me again. Call me if you find the girl.

And not only for me. To die there in the street would have been very easy. But it would not be exactly. At least not in the concept of justice that a father teaches to a son. They sentenced me in more or less one week. The lawyer said that the judge will be indulgent for me to have given me. Maybe this is not the happiest end of all. But and the right. Some day they will give me probation. And we can proceed with our lives. And only a subject of time. Of course the time and only a murderous system with numbers with a composed meaning arrested to him. Or not? : NUMBER 23 : --- Legends for H. Miraculous, I hope has liked! --- "Be sure that yours sin he had found!" "...as bound by duty of office, I ask you to acknowledge this vote." Madam President, I accept the vote. "After long anticipation in Bonn Richard von Weizäcker won the election. He won more votes than his prior elections. It's his greatest success since Theodor Heuss. It's no coincidence; he starts his second term, the same day West Germany's basic law became law on May 23, 1949, 40 years ago." - Let's have a toast. Finish that later. Let's celebrate now! - We'll just have a sip - We'll do the rest Would you do the honors and open this? I can't recall how often I've read "Illuminatus." 50 times? 60 times? One part was most interesting. 'All great anarchists die on the 23rd of the month.' The 23rd is a good day to die." This is an illegal protest. Disperse or we'll use force. No Nuclear Plants! - Karl! Come back! Look out! - Care to explain these? - Where'd you get these? - Nevermind that. They'd been in the paper if not for me. You're a disgrace. - Why am I? We're fighting to fix your generations mistakes. - Nonsense. If you were better informed, you'd realize you're wrong. "My father was editor of a Hannover right-wing newspaper. We argued non-stop. With a father like him, there are two choices: give up and conform or rebel." Finished! ? Good day! Beate? Want to meet in the meeting room? - Sure. I'll tell Alex. - 'Taz' has '10,000 peaceful demonstrators.' - 'Frankfurter Rundschau', reports '8,000 organized against atomic power.' - but 'Hannoversche Rundschau': 'under 5,000 demonstrators many of them violent radicals.' - Thats crap! - Is this your dad's doing? - It's what he likes. - Right-wing press falsifies numbers - See what your missing! Karl... Is this your doing? - Is it illegal to express opinion? - Get 'Cactus', the new 'Cactus'... Hey! Stop that shit! What about, 'freedom of the press? ' - You know it's libelous. You know it's not true. - Prove it. - I'll vacate your room... - Oh yeah... - if you don't learn respect. - And put your whore-mistress in my room. - I'd care less if you dropped dead. "Half a year later my father was dead. He died from a brain tumor. In some way, I felt responsible but, I couldn't feign grief. Unlike my step mother; she got bonds and the house. I inherited 50,000 DM and his desk. I withdrew the money right-away. Saving wasn't my style. - Why didn't you move-in? - I'd rather not live alone. - Interested? Plenty of room. - What's the catch? - You do what you want here... freedom for everyone! - Why are you alone out here? - I'm taking a break. - Don't you like the party? - A bit crowded. I don't know most people. - It's OK. I like having many people over. Want to join me? Something I want to show you... His associates found it in his desk. - 'National Research Award'... Great haircut! - I won it when I turned 14. That's the author... Robert Anton Wilson - He looks strange. - Dad made a mistake... thought it was a kid's book. When he knew the truth, he confiscated it. Now it's all mine again. - "Nothing is true. Everything's permitted. World history is war between secret societies." - Wilson says the world isn't what it seems. A secret society controls all the Illuminati. But Hagbard Celine is a rebel, an anarchist on a submarine. From there he fights Illuminati. He has a computer on the a sub computing risk of World War III with simulations. - Mmmhm - Computer's named, "Fuck Up". - What? - Fuckup: First Universal Cybernetic Kinetic Ultra-micro Programmable If you want, I'll lend it to you. - I guess. "Reality at last, Ten bottles of wine, all empty too fast!" Pizza anyone? - End this now or I'll call the cops Alex - Who pissed on the mailboxes? What a mess! - Who's that whiner? - My landlord. My landlord says he'll call the cops. It's over. Go home. "Beate didn't take 'Illuminatus,' Alex only read parts on sex and drugs. He plain, 'didn't get it.' What Wilson's wrote about assassinations was riveting. I repeatedly read it, and sought other believers. BBS were populated by people like me. I got a computer and joined my peers. Just a simple computer. Only a Commodore, but it served my needs. I felt I discovered a new continent. I visited my global neighbors. It didn't take long to choose a name On a BBS where 'Illuminatus' was argued, I read Wilson would visit a Hamburg Chaos Computer Club meeting. Many computer freaks attended from all over Germany. Many were inert but some had skills. It's like converting a harmless child's toy into a bomb. 'Scarabeus' hacked Frankfurt airport's flight arrival board 'Conan' took-over Luxemburg's power grid. 'Fishball' had an illegal mail server at GAC. Then there was 'David' from Hannover. His net-name was 'Goliath'. - We're now discovering that the true source of wealth is information, and it increases as it's shared. "Wilson said computers will revolutionize society. Information will be more important than money. Knowledge is power and will be controlled by few. Hagbard Celine fights these 'few'. I saw 'Illuminatus' meant more than I thought. - Know what's interesting? The Illuminati's' secret number. - It's 23. - And 5. - Why 5? - 5 is the sum of those digits. The U.S. DoD is in the Pentagon; Mrs. HAN. Please don't do this. Sheesh, Kicked out without even shoes. What about that bum, LEE Jae-jun? Apparently, he was just going to a sauna. God, I thought we had him But we still have our men out there on stakeout. What are we doing here? By the way, what do we do about KIM? His radio is off and his pager isn't working. I think something bad has happened to him. Don't even think something like that. Let's have a little faith in him, alright? Don't worry. He'll show up. God, it's cold. Hey! Over here! Days Missing: 11 Nice and cool. Did you get the prints from the Grandeur? There was nothing there, sir. You ran over every single corner? There isn't even a single hair? No, sir. He's a real thorough bastard. Shit. We sure met our match this time. Hey, trunk detail. Don't you remember anything at all? The doorjust opened and this gas gun just... God, I think my ulcers are back. Listen up. Commissioner's orders. No word for twenty-four hours, and the case goes public. Till then, watch the parents and round up the suspects again. But making the case public, without even knowing if the kid is okay Then you should've done a betterjob. What's with the grudge toward the boy's father? Would you like it if your best friend ratted you out to the media for his own glory? He's a fucking animal inside a mars skin. How could he be human and do that to me? So you served two years and got out six months ago... Huh. What's this? Days Missing: 12 You're still up for three grand? Wow, you need a lot of money, don't you? Yes, well. It'd be nice if I had some. A need for revenge and for money... Is that why you did it? Did what? Where were you between the 18th and 22nd of June? I was flying to the country. Gangneung. I gave you proof, didn't I? You're one sick little bastard, aren't you? You saved this to give yourself an alibi, eh? You're a regular Sherlock Holmes. One lie detector test and it'll be crystal clear. Whatever you want. This is just that bastard reaping what he's sown, just dying to climb up that ladder... Ut sementem feceris, ita metes. Ut seme... Huh? What a bastard. Alright, then. Let's dig this sucker up. Next is their relationships with acquaintances. LEE Jae-jun has just been released for construction conspiracies and is being brought in for Days Missing: 13 questioning as the prime suspect. He is on very bad terms with HAN Kyung-bae. You mean the friend made the phone threats? Does that make sense? He knows his voice. It... doesn't, of course... But, would the voice really matter that much? What matters is this strong motive... Well, our scientific analysis shows that the voiceprint doesn't match up 100%. Come on. He could've gotten someone else to call. LEE Jae-jun could have a partner. We're still investigating that. Forensics is all fine and dandy, but still... You have to follow your instincts, right? Is that how a cop got kidnapped? Instincts? Come on Mr. HAN. What is this? Just hold on, Sang-woo... Don't get scared. Take it like a man. Keep it cool, son. Cool and strong. No, no. Don't try to be tough and just beg the man. Beg him to let you go, boy. Beg him to let you live. Beg him to let you live! Beg him to let you live! Days Missing: 14 Superman, the mighty prince of bravery. Batman and Robin, soldiers of justice. Wonder Woman, soaring through the sky. Aquaman, the prince of the sea. Dad, your shoulders are so tense. Does that feel better? This is a bonus. I won't take the coupon. Feel good? Ever seen a son like me? No, of course not. My son is the best... - Hello? Hello? - How have you been? Did you get the car? Hello. Where's Sang-woo? You said you'd let him go. You have the money. Are you joking? I told you not to report it. Putting your trust in the stupid cops... It's tragic how things didn't go according to your brilliant plans... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir. I'll give you more. I'll even sell the house. Please just give us back our son. Your fatherly love is quite impressive. Are all well-off fathers as devoted as you? Anyway... Seeing as to how desperate you are, I will give you one last chance. What? A chance? You think you're gonna get away with this? Hello? Hello, hello? You sick little motherfucker... What the hell do you want from me? Who the fuck are you? Hello? I'm so sorry, sir. I made a huge mistake. I'll give you more. Another hundred grand. Just let me hear Sang-woo's voice once. Life often demands servility, doesn't it? The all-mighty anchorman, HAN Kyung-bae... Wait. Dad, help me... Sang-woo, Sang-woo, it's Dad. - Hello? Sang-woo. - You still have a hundred grand left. This is your last chance. Yes, thank you. Thank you. I'll give you everything. Thank you, sir. Thank you. He's alive. My little boy. Hold on. Daddy will. Daddy will come and save you. Just hold on... Believe in God and go to Heaven! Days Missing: 15 HAN In-su Doozie. Why didn't I think of this before? One more time. Knock, and it will open. Days Missing: 16 Ten years of trunk stakeouts and now I've reached goddamn Nirvana. Long time no see. How you been? Hey, what about the free dumplings? What? Lao Xiao? When I think back, I didn't have a gun in my hand, but I still killed a lot of people. Who do you think you are? They'd say, and back then, I thought I was God. There was nothing that I couldn't do. I thought life was supposed to be like that. Pure glory. But it was all in vain. All fake. In the end, this is what I've become... God is punishing me. I have to admit, that family motto about glory was a little over the top... I hated all you cops because you sit around helplessly and wait. So I kept putting you down on purpose. Well, to be honest, it's not like we don't deserve it sometimes. But we're on this day and night, putting everyone and everything we've got into it. But he's one tough son of a bitch, real sly. Why isn't he calling back, though? You think our Sang-woo is in pain? We can't lose hope... Let's go public with the investigation. We can play his voice on the air, someone will recognize it and report him. No. That'll be the end of Sang-woo. I know you're going through hell, but... Hello? Hello? Oh, uh. We just got these today... Hello? Yes, Detective KIM. Hey, detective. How'd you know I was here? The detective lady told me where you were. But Dad, you're a big mess. Huh? No, I'm in disguise. Undercover work. It's clean underwear and some snacks. Thanks, kiddo. You know Dad, this is really cool. You have to catch him, okay? I believe in you. You got it. I'll get him no matter what. Days Missing: 17 I can't trust Sang-woo's father anymore. If you want Sang-woo to live, don't let anyone know and come alone. Wear something in a reddish color. Oh, and Sang-woo's tooth just fell out. Sang-woo... Sang-woo, Sang-woo... Hi, baby. I love you. Whoowhee. Now, what's all this? It's a voiceprint analyzer. Like a fingerprint, each voice has a different pattern. Do you want to try it? Good night, baby. Hi, baby. Hi, baby. Baby. Does it work even if you make your voice sound different? Well, basically, yes. No matter how hard you try to mask it, the characteristic pattern doesn't change. At least, in theory. So you should try to keep him on the phone for as long as possible. This machine will decipher his tone of speech, origin, level of education and even the street noises. It can catch all. Can I count on your full cooperation? If all things were as easy as words. Hello. Helloooo? Heeeello? How can it tell if you talk like this? Just a freaking waste of time. What the... Damn it. Hello. Uh, yes. Yes, one second. It's for you. Hello? Yes, I've heard. Hello. Which words does he use a lot? Anway, anyways... Docking... I just, I don't know. I can't remember. What? Try to keep him on the phone? If you know how, I'd sure like to know. What? You want me to work him up? Now, you listen to me! If something happens to my son, what then? Mr. HAN seems quite different from on T.V. By the way, where is the child's mother? Oh, yes. She went to church for a sec... What? Are you out of your fucking mind? Mr. HAN! Mr. HAN! The Lord cares deeply about you. Amen. The answers are inside your prayers. Let us pray. Our Heavenly Father... Ji-sun! Ji-sun, Ji-sun... You can't do this during service. - This is unacceptable. Please leave. - Hold on. - Mr. HAN, please leave the chapel. - Reverend. Sir, I'm sorry. Reverend, have you seen my wife? Deacon Oh hasn't come today. - Please leave. - Ji-sun! I'm so sorry. Ji-sun. We told you, she isn't here. Please leave. I'm sorry. Just wait one minute. She said she was going to church. I'm sorry. - Mr. HAN! - Then where did she go? Where? Ma'am, are you sick or something? Why the coat? It's the middle of summer. Sir, why is there so much traffic? Of course there is. It's rush hour. Lady! You gotta pay the damn fare. Once you get out of the first tunnel, there's a bus station at the intersection. There, you will see a trash can. Sir, wait! Wait, excuse me. Sorry, I'm sorry... Wha, What in the world... Are you insane? Come to the in front of Heehyundong department store. - Cha, you majored in judo, right? - Yes. About time you used your head too, isn't it? Excuse me? You completely fell for her stupid excuse. Would you go to church to pray at a time like this? Would you? I'd worry about the damn trunk, if I were you. What? The trunk, eh? You try doing trunk detail, why don't you. Let me try that fucking forensic bullshit. Oh, wait. You wouldn't fit inside. You think science is child's play? You saying I can't do it? You little bitch. You think you look all scientific? My ass. You don't look too smart either, alright? So stop saying 'forensics' this and 'science' that. It doesn't suit your image, woman. I'm a bitch, huh? What the hell are you doing? So what did we tell you from the start? Leave him to us. Don't act on your own. Didrt we say that? It's not helping us any if she acts like this. Excuse me?

Huh, the sneaky little bastards. HAN In-seok? The bank account is HAN In-su. Goddamn bastard. Just by looking at it, it's the same as LEE Jae-jun... So, what do you think? Is there a resemblance? I'm watching you... You said one eye has a double eyelid, right? Yes... Analysis shows him as male, in his early to mid-thirties, from Gyeongsang Province. About 5' 11', thin physique. His has an educated voice and doesn't get worked up easily. Judging by his extremely cunning strategies, he has had higher education. We're not looking for the same face, just something that feels similar... You know, the impression. First impression. Let me see. I was busy making the seal... A lid. Try putting a lid on him. Right, a cap. A cap... - What do you think? - It looks similar. Do you really want to save him? It hurts, so don't shout. What is this about? I'm HAN In-seok. No, I don't have the money to buy land. For one thing, it's very similar. I'll need to bring him in and get some more voice samples. Okay, let's can this HAN In-seok. Do you really want to save him? I'm going to starve him. He's sound asleep from the cold medicine. Hey, now. You have a cold too or something? Roll it again. You better do it right. His fever is getting worse. I ought to just finish him and all this. Once the money is safe with me, the kid will be docked safe with you. Is that all? Dr. LEE? Is that good? Okay, good. You suckers. You know what this is? This is the suspect's voice. Down here, yours. There's a resemblance there, don't you think? Disguise it all you want, but in the end, your voice is still your voice. That's what. Analysis doesn't lie. This is the beauty of forensic science, you see. I told you, I was down in the country! Why do you keep accusing me? Days Missing: 23 You! What were you doing? I was in reserve forces training. Here's the note of confirmation. Well, I'll be damned. Let me lay the facts out for you. You sent someone else to reserve training. - We have all the evidence. - What evidence? Anyway, you've got the wrong person. Show me proof. Anyway? Anyway... Fine. Proof? My thoughts exactly. You want proof? Days Missing: 24 Mr. HAN. Mr. HAN, sir. Mr. HAN. - Mr. HAN. - Where's Sang-woo? Where is he? A bit early to be drunk, isn't it? Get off me. You wanna die? Where is Sang-woo? Let's say I do know where he is. Do you actually think I would tell you? Where's Sang-woo, you sick fuck? Jae-jun. I was wrong. I'll apologize. I'm so sorry. So please, give Sang-woo back. I'm the bastard. Sang-woo did nothing wrong. Please, Jae-jun. We're frien... Friends? The fuck we are. Spineless motherfucker. Please, just once. I'll give you everything. Money. As much as you want. Everything... No, I'll do anything you tell me to. Anything. So please, just give us back our son.

We look forward to how they might please him next year, with an even bigger feast. I hope everyone has a peaceful evening. Do you think the Frog Boys will come home?

The thing is, Mr. HAN. Forensics called in today, and it appears that Sang-woo's voice was a tape recording. What?

Days Missing: 25 Phone Threats: 41 You clearly have no devotion to your son. What made you think you could stay home? You've got some nerve, I'll give you that. - Give us back our son. - You're obviously impudent as well. You should've kept your promise. The money wasrt transferred. I told you, the technical problem wasrt our fault. Are you gonna keep on lying to me? Oh, I see. Maybe you're testing my patience. So then, you really want to have a go at it? Gladly. Don't you ever think of seeing Sang-woo again. Hello. Mr. HAN, you're being quite unreasonable here. You're the one that's unreasonable. Alright, then. Please come out right now.

I'm in the middle of breakfast. You don't want to be doing this, Mr. HAN... You want Sang-woo to die, don't you? Anyway, let's do this in thirty minutes. Thirty minutes? No problem. It tastes good? Can you eat at a time like this? Are you, are you human? Huh? Have you gone completely insane? You think... our Sang-woo is dead? Who told you to give up? Who gave you the right? You can't give up, you can't... Our Sang-woo isn't dead. My son won't die that easily. So... So please, please don't do this. Promise me that you'll come back with Sang-woo today. Hello.

Once upon a Christmas Eve the Nutcracker ballet was performed to everyone's delight. And while this ballet had many admirers in this theater, it had no greater fan than little Jerry Mouse. Meanwhile, outside the theater... King of the cats That's what he is Takin ' all our sustenance Like it was really his Greedy to a fault Bully to us all He'll only be your friend So you can take the fall But he's really something special Something you just can 't deny Everybody raise a cheer Mainly 'cause we know he's here Everybody raise a cheer To the king of the cats King of the cats That's what I am Pushing 'em around Because I know I can Greedy to a fault Bully to 'em all - He'll only be your friend - So you can take the fall But he's really something special Something you just can 't deny Everybody raise a cheer Mainly 'cause we know he's here Everybody raise a cheer To the king of the cats Now he must sadly wait another long year until the next performance. Nothing for Jerry in this empty place except his love of the ballet. If only he could dance. What's the use of pretending? These things never change. Why, that would take a miracle. Bravo! Bravo! But wait! A mouse needs more. And a mouse king needs his royal court. No worries. You can't hurt a quality toy. And a ballet needs a ballerina. A lovely couple, no? Sorry. Come to think of it, a mouse king needs a kingdom too. Even if it's built on fragile magic. But of course, magic affects both friend and foe alike. Boys, round up them worthless toys. I'm taking over this kingdom. Oh, Jerry, what shall we do? Cease and desist, pussycat. This is Monsieur Jerry's wish. All he wanted was to dance. And this kingdom sprang from those desires. We must respect his dream, no? Oh, Mr. Cat, I have a present for you. Me? Thanks. It's what I've always wanted. Isn't that a bomb? A bomb? ! Somebody, do something. Slacker. Stop those toys. Get moving! Whoa, Nelly! Prime Minister Lackey! So, what's the state of my kingdom? I have some grave misgivings about the treatment of the toys. Enough. You're bringing me down. So where's that little dancing doll? Prepare to be amused. Oh, goody. Take a hike, Tim. Now, how about a little dance? Oh, I get it. You need music. Not a big fan of the banjo, huh? I will never dance for you. You've ruined everything. Everybody seems pretty happy around here to me. It doesn't matter. There's nothing you or anybody can do about it. You forget about Jerry. Your little mouse king? That's a riot. Don't underestimate him. He will never give up. You can't give up yet. Why, alls we need is a great idea. Sorry, I can only talk if someone gives my string a pull. I was thinking, we need someone to aid us. And? And I have this tag that reads "The Toymaker." Well, I got one too. Kind of itches. So you think we should find the Toymaker? If he even exists. Of course he does. Somebody made us and his name is Toymaker. Yes, but where can we find him? Well, maybe you can contribute something here. Follow the star? I guess that's worked before. You know, I've been thinking maybe it wouldn't hurt to finish off that mouse. Just to be on the safe side. So whom should we send? - How about Tim? - I think you mean Tom. Very well, Tim it is. Tom, sir. Tim, take all the men you need and make sure that mouse never comes back. Get it? So, by the command of the cat king Tom gathered his troops and set off to catch a mouse. We're marching off to fight We'll catch that mouse And do what's right We're marching off to fight To go and get that mouse Hey, ho, away we go One, two, three, in a row We're marching round and round To go and crush that mouse. We're heading off to fight We'll march and march All through the night We're heading off to fight To go and beat that mouse Hey, ho, off we go Hit him high and hit him low We're heading off to fight To go and mince that mouse. We're marching off to fight We'll fight our foe with all our might We're marching off to fight To go and break that mouse Hey, ho, away we go Loaded down with guns in tow We're marching off to fight To go and squash that mouse Maybe we should send the chicken. Mademoiselle Ballerina Lady! I am coming to rescue you. - Tuffy? - Yes, it is I. And I will set you free. Oh, Tuffy, the cats are heading out to destroy Jerry. Time is of the essence. You must warn him. Then take these keys and free yourself. Hurry, Tuffy. Hurry! I shall not fail you. Hold it. What's this? Looks like Tom is carving a path straight to Jerry. That little mouse is gonna need all the luck he can get. Are you sure this is it? A toy wouldn't head through that scary place. A river. All right, I've got a confession to make. I'm not really a toy. I'm only a decoration, an ornament, not suitable for play. If I get wet, I'm liable to start falling apart. Well, it is frozen solid. Hey. Looks like fun... I got it. Thanks. Hey, look at me. I'm skating. Oh, no. I think he's stuck. Come on, Jer, you can do it. No. Don't give up, buddy. Please, we need you. Help me, Nelly. Oh, boy. You scared the stuffings out of us. We gotta get you someplace warm. Hey, little lady, what's going on here? A string attached to keys can only mean one thing: Playtime. Your majesty, I have some... What is going on here? Me and the little ballerina are playing keys. You should really try it sometime. Yes, it sounds fascinating. I know what you're trying to do. You're attempting to distract the king from his duties. Well, it won't work. Here, I haven't got all day. She's got more keys than I do. Clever. But we'll have no more of this nonsense. I hope I make myself clear. Send up the telescope. - The telescope. - The telescope. The telescope. Do not harm Monsieur Jerry. Be kind and gentle. This is your conscience speaking. The little voice that tells you right from wrong. The quality of mercy is not strained. It dropeth as a gentle rain from heaven. Look, there he is. Why do you listen to that little fool? I say do the mouse in. No. I appeal to your better nature. Do not listen to this ruffian. Well, at least I'm not wearing a dress. Time to rub out the rodent. Please, I beseech you to... Well, think it over. Sleep on it, won't you? Sometimes a conscience must take drastic measures. Feeling better, Jerry? I'm coming undone. I knew it. The water must have melted my glue. Oh, we have to put a stop to that. I had an aunt who started to unravel. Not a pretty picture, huh? What? Oh, of course, the Toymaker. He'll be able to fix you right up. Sure, no worries. Bonjour, Monsieur Jerry. It is I. - What are you doing here, Tuffy? - The ballerina lady sent me to warn you. Warn us about what? - The cats. - The cats? They are coming to do away with you. They are probably surrounding us even as we speak. That doesn't sound much like a mouse to me. It's more of a... No, it sounds like... Oh, I can't put my finger on it. You know, that sounds like a cat. - You sure? - Well, not a hundred percent. Oh, yeah, definitely a cat. That brings your batting average to.340 There it is, Jerry, bright as day. The Toymaker must be right over this ridge. Has Monsieur Paulie lost his head again? I'm not lost. I'm in here. You know, I like you better without your head. So good of you to bridge the gap. There's nothing to fear. We just need to find Monsieur Paulie's head and be on our way. Did I mention that I prefer him without it? Hey, fellows. I'm over here. I see you managed to hang on to one of those keys. But if you wanna make it work you gotta tie it to a string. Asleep, finally. Oh, Monsieur Jerry, how can we ever reach the Toymaker from here? Do you have any idea what we're celebrating? Don't worry. I'll hang on to you like a fat man to a doughnut. Oh, boy. Careful, Tuffy. Whoa, Nelly! Talk about holding on by a thread. Tuffy, set her down someplace, quick. I told you I wouldn't let go. I can't. I'm just too scared. I guess I'm just not cut out to save the day. We've gotta find out where they're headed. But how are we gonna get her to talk? I think I can help you with that. Let me see the tongue-tied patient. I have special methods for restoring speech. So tell me, my dear, where are your friends headed? They're off to see the Toymaker. Did you hear? The Toymaker! Why, a guy like that's liable to cause big trouble for us. And just how can we find this Toymaker? Follow the star. It will lead you to him. See? That didn't hurt a bit. At least not physically. She's a traitor now. She can't go back to her friends. They'll hate her. And I thought I was cruel. I can't believe it. Finally. You were right, Monsieur Jerry. All we had to do was follow the star. A little help here. Can you imagine? I got snagged on a branch. Sure hope the Toymaker's got some knitting needles. We've done it. Nothing can stop us now. Sorry, boys, but this is the end of the line. - How'd you know we were coming here? - Your little horsey friend told us. I shall pummel you vigorously if you hurt but a single hair in her mane. Hurt her? Alls we did was pull her string and we couldn't shut her up. Monsieur Jerry, we have come so far. Monsieur Jerry, we have come so far. Are you fine fellows here to see me? We are, sir, if you are the Toymaker. At your service, lads. You're also a toy repairer right? Don't you worry. I've fixed a toy or two in my time. I suppose I should tell you, I'm not really a toy. Yes, I remember. You're a decoration. Not suitable for play. But you have the heart of a toy. And so you shall be one, my son. Sir, we've come a great distance to ask for your help. I know why you've come. In fact, I know a lot about you. I've been following your adventures for longer than you know. You need a solution to your cat problem. Well, I think I've got the answer. Do you know what has become of our friend? Nelly? I'm afraid she's become discouraged. She feels she's betrayed you and that you'd never want to see her again. I knew I was right about you. Little mice with big hearts. - Are you ready? - Ready for what? Presenting the new and improved Paulie Pixie. Thanks, T.M. Guess what. I'm a real toy. Suitable for aggressive play patterns. - Oh, Paulie, may I? - Be my guest. Go ahead, pull harder. Harder. It's okay. I used a lot more glue this time. But there's something you must know. When the sun rises, the magic that created your kingdom will begin to fade. And if you fail to reclaim your throne by the time the sun has climbed into the sky it will remain the domain of the cats forever. But there is a way to recapture your kingdom. And this, my little friend, is the key. I wish I could stay to see what's in store for you but I have some important errands I must run. Merci beaucoup, Monsieur Toymaker, for everything. What did he mean by "in store" and what is that key do? Sir, what are you doing? Well certainly not playing with keys. Keys? Oh, dear. Don't worry. She left this. Guards! Guards! Find that ballerina! Do you mind? We're right in the middle of a doll crisis. Oh, boy. Do something. Don't just stand there. Do something! Lower the drawbridge! Lower the drawbridge! It seems we've found her. Toys, for freedom! Move it! Is this the end? Oh, it can't be. It can't be! Go, Nelly! Retreat! Oh, Jerry! I never doubted you. Is she...? She was the bravest one of us all. I'm alive. And I can talk. Without a string. Look at them. Now that's what I call a happy ending. Subtitles by SDI Media Group I never dreamt I'd be traveling the whole world with a boy who never left the house. This has to end. If he's having marital problems, I should be helping him. I should not be pickling his wife. Leslie's... my girlfriend. I will not even take a nap until you and your entire gang are suffering sideways. Until Nick is gone for another ten years. Hey, Eddie. Making sure we're still on for 3:00. Maybe he didn't go to the barbecue. - Doesn't want to be seen with me. - [Hannah] Don't go there. [Sam] My mom broke up with Big Cat. Maybe now you and her could get together. - [Lkey] You think the kid is yours? - Peanut allergy, he's got one. I need Nick. Where's Nick? Have you met Aubrey? - [Car tires screeching] - [Crashing] - [Car tires screeching] - [Crashing] - [Commander] Don't move him. - [Leslie] I think he's breathing. [Commander] Oh! Stay with me, son. Oh, no... - How is he? - Well, they're not sure yet. - What happened? - The kid took a spill on his bike. Ass over tea kettle on the handle bars. The doctors think there's internal bleeding from the fall. - Where's Hannah? - With Sam. - How did this happen? - We're not sure. We heard tires screeching, ran out and Mrs. Womack saw Sam lyin' in the middle of the road, wiped out. She drove around the corner, almost creamed him. - Your father had Ronnie call EMS. - He wasn't breathing right. The paramedics said a respiratory distress caused the blackout. - Why was he having trouble breathing? - His peanut allergy. - No way. - [Lkey] For real? He must have eaten peanuts, but nobody knows what or why. Which is crazy because he's always so super-careful about those things. He used to joke he doesn't even like reading the Peanuts comic strip, because he's afraid it'll make his throat close. The Sticky Monster! OK, everybody. Everybody has to try Alison's favorite, - macadamia peanut butter cake! - [Lkey] Yeah! Is he OK? He's a dad. [Bell tolling] [Door opening] Mmm... - Hmm... - Comfy? I like it here, in your arms. Well, we fit together... Good proportions. - Ergonomically, we work. - Mmm... It's time for me to feed the starving masses, isn't it? Sadly, yes. Well, duty calls. And you know what they call a pizza without a pizza delivery girl? No, what? Nothing but a slab of bread, cheese and sauce growing cold on the counter under the glowering glare of Mr. Sonny Pippilito, my boss. with a strange frenchman moving into our house. There was that one exchange student. Look, she's, like, the child whisperer, okay? Let her focus on cooper. You focus on the match. We'll be fine. Okay. Okay? Go, team kevrah. Where are those guys? I don't know. You think we scared them off yesterday? Robert? Doubtful. Senator. Bill stanton. Good to meet you. It's a beautiful day for a good cause, wouldn't you say? Yeah, I'm... Just happy to be here to help out. Yeah, you know, I was sorry to hear you're not running for reelection. Ah. You got a line on what's next? That's sort of the $1-million question. Well, don't tell me it's golf. That'd be a prime waste of national resources. Well, now, now. You should wait until you see my short game before you say that. Well, maybe we should play sometime. Maybe we should. It's a nice club you have here. You're not a member, are you? No, no. I'm surprised they let me in at all. I think I've passed bills with less paperwork. Yeah. Well, sorry about that. Bureaucracy, right? Indeed. Well, next time, call me up. I'll walk you straight in. Or I could join. I'd be glad to sponsor you. Here. Try my cell if you're interested. Thank you. Pleasure, senator. I don't want to watch tennis. Why couldn't I have just stayed home with evan and his nanny? It's gonna be fun. Hold on. Hold on. I want to put more block on your nose.

Don't schmooze with the prince of darkness, okay? I mean, what did he want, help on votes for a contract? We were talking about golf. I just hope no one got a picture, 'cause that would be bad publicity. I thought you didn't work for me anymore. For kitty, I mean. But you're right. I don't work at all. So let's play tennis. Mccallisterandlaurenttoserve, first set. ah. Ooh. Nice serve. 15-love. Where the hell did that come from? Lucky shot. That wasn't a lucky shot. That was an ace. Hey.

Why do you have an umbrella? Shh. It's, um, it's not for the rain. It's for the sun. It's like your hat, only bigger, way bigger. Cooper, stop it. I'm just shooting luc. 15-30. Justin, would you grab that from him? You're the one who started it. What did I do? You think he got the idea to turn that into a gun all by himself? Uh, yes, mom. He's a boy. You take away the umbrella, he'll use a stick. You take away the stick, he'll use his hand. I had nothing to do with it. I'm gonna get a soda. Would you like anything? No, thank you. You should really knock that off. Cooper, stop it. 30 all. Hi, honey. How did you miss that? Sorry, I got distracted. Kevrah was undefeated in 17 years, okay? I'd like to keep it that way. oh. Nice shot. 40-30. Cooper, stop it. Cooper. Cooper. Cooper, what are you doing? Cooper. I'll handle this. He's throwing balls at the court. This is not cool. Listen, you talking to him now is only gonna make things worse. They're not gonna get any better if you keep butting in. What? He's my son. Yes, he is. And where do i fit in? Look, I don't know, but he already has a father, who, by the way, is not exactly thrilled about you, and obviously, neither is cooper. I'm stuck in the middle. I'm trying to figure it out. Well, you let me know when you do. Till then, we're not gonna be able to play as a team. Coop. Cooper. My... Sorry. It was an accident. Okay... Listen to me, that was no accident. The corkscrew, the swimming pool, this... None of it was an accident, was it, cooper? Hmm? Okay, you're coming home with me. Oh, I... Mom, this is my job, not yours. Sorry, kevin. We gotta forfeit. What? Get outta here. ow! hey. hey. Come on. We're leaving. What, already? Who... Who won the match? No one. It was a forfeit. Come on. Well, where is cooper? He's with sarah, so let's go. What, you know what? Time-out. What... What's the deal? Are you mad at me or something? No, I'm not mad at you. I'm onto you, justin. Wh... You're on... The funeral, the dog tags, all these war stories to cooper... I know where this is headed. Don't put words in my mouth. You want to go back to this hideous war. I don't want to go back, mom. I just want to... Don't lie to me, justin. I've been through this before. You went there twice. The last time almost killed you. Why would you go back? Your life is great. You're in med school. You have a wife who loves you. Yeah, and I love her, too, mom, and there's noth... You made a commitment to stay with her. You can't walk away from your life, justin. You can't. mm. that feels good. Wow. Andy roddick passed out on my couch. Roger federer's a better player. Yeah, but roddick is cuter. Oh, I'm flattered. But we both lost the big game. Well, I bet you played hard and gave it your all. Why are you being so nice to me? Maybe I feel guilty. I haven't exactly been paying attention to you lately. That's all right. I'm not a child. Although I have been behaving like one recently. We're having a baby in seven months. I need to get a job, any job. It's not about the job. Okay, I need to make money. It's not really about the money either. You need a purpose. And it's not tennis. Can we just leave all the purpose to you, just for a moment? I really want you to open this restaurant. Maybe that's my purpose, encouraging you. Do you know what I miss? What? The old kevin walker... Who ran towards his purpose. So why am I running away from it now? Because you don't know what it is and you hate uncertainty. At least i'm certain of you. Now I know we talked about luc moving in, and you were excited about the idea of it. But now there's a whole new member of the family, and we think you might be finding it a bit challenging. hmm? It's different than what I expected. I get that. You know, for me, too. But he's here now, so it's time that we all learn... How we're gonna get along. Now I love luc, okay? So when you hurt his feelings, you hurt my feelings, the same way that I'd be hurt if somebody hurt you. You know what I'm talking about? yes. Good. So do you have something you might want to say to luc? I'm sorry, luc. Thank you, cooper. Okay, now you go brush your teeth, start a chapter, and I'll be in to tuck you in, okay? I love you. Mwah. Nicely done. Thank you. I wonder if he's upset that he's not the man of the house anymore. You know, he used to... Come and cuddle and fall asleep and... He always had me all to himself. Speaking of cuddling... You know, I don't think cooper is the only problem here. I think you need to deal with your own issues. You're right. I'm so sorry. Okay, here's the deal... What if the only reason we've been deliriously happy is because we've been living in a fantasy? And now it's... Real. Yeah. Real is good, right? Real is real. It's paint colors and temper tantrums and... And the emotional lives of 8 year olds. I don't want to mess this up, luc. For me, this is... This is a huge deal. And it's a huge deal for me, too. I want to be a family with you. But you think cooper's tough? Try living with a 13-year-old girl who hates you. You're so relaxed about it. I don't think you really have thought through the stress that children put on a relationship. What if it's just too hard? Now I can deal with you breaking my heart. But I can't deal with you breaking theirs. I'm not gonna break anyone's heart. But we don't know that, do we? I love you, sarah. And I'm not trying to be their father or anything. No, I know. But do you know who you do want to b your partner, a very positive role model for the kids. And for that, i'm gonna need to have my own relationship with them. Then we are very, very, very lucky. Hello. hi. What have you got there? Oh, I just wanted to thank you for taking care of evan for so long. Oh, don't be silly. I'm his grandmother. I love it. Oh, I know. That's why it's not cash. Oh. Well, thank you. Sure. So, um... He's asleep in the living room right now in his playpen thingy. The nanny left right after we got back from the game. I'm just packing up all of his stuff right now. Okay. Robert, can I ask you something? Sure. Did justin talk to you about wanting to go back to afghanistan? Oh, god. He did. Look, nora... Oh, please tell me you didn't say anything to encourage him. No, I just listened. To what? Nora, the first time you enlist, it can be about a bunch of things. But if you reenlist, it's personal. It's about wanting to get back to people who you love and who understand you in a way that nobody else possibly can. Oh, that's easy for you to say. You're not going back to war. Well, we all go to war in different ways. But I don't want my son to go back to this war ever again. I understand. But that pull is awfully strong. And that's your son. Maybe you want to go take care of him. Oh, hey. Oh, my gosh. You would not believe the traffic out there. The 101 is... Is bumper-to-bumper ridiculous. Where's the little guy? Oh, he's... He's... Oh, shoot. Just got him down. So... No, no, no. First of all, just tell me, who won the match? Oh, luc and I won. You're kidding me? You beat kevrah? Yes, in a forfeit. Wait a minute... Cooper had a meltdown, so sarah had to leave. oh. so? So... Here's to my endorsements. I got 'em both. That is fantastic. It was a long shot, but I worked my magic, and as soon as hix caved, I called mccarty and... It's like I always say. What? What do you always say? Never bet against my wife. Oh. Mm. So how was the rest of your weekend? Anything important? Nothing to tell. Rebecca. Hello? hey. hey. ¶ it can be a real long road ¶ i, uh, I've been calling you. Yeah, I just needed to get out of the house so I took a run. At night? That's a little, uh, unsafe. Good thing I have reflectors on my shoes. oh. ¶ when you're on your own ¶ you want to talk? You know what, justin? I think you should do the talking. I don't know how to help you. Okay. ¶ it can be a real long ride ¶ rebecca, ever since the funeral, I've been thinking about how much jake and the other guys mean to me. And it's so much more than anything that's going on in my life right now. See, i, um... I don't think I want to be a doctor anymore. It just... It doesn't feel right. You know, it's all about being the best and... And not a team. And... There's one place where I felt like I belonged to a team... Where guys had my back. Don't. Don't you dare. No, no, look, let me talk, all right? Just because I'm feeling it doesn't mean I'm gonna act upon it, okay? So talk. ¶ don't hold back ¶ i'm not happy. What? Is it me or... No, no. Is it the house? No, no, it's... Justin, i'm sorry I got so excited. I mean, that house would mean nothing to me without you in it. Rebecca, you don't have to explain all that, okay? 'cause you are the only thing that works in my life. You are the one true thing. ¶... Where you end ¶ I just want to feel... Like I belong somewhere else, too. ¶ when I'm looking in your eyes ¶ and you will. ¶ give me just one more chance ¶ come here. mom. I'm leaving. Mom? Are you trapped under something heavy? no. mom? ¶ don't hold back ¶ what are you doing in here? Nothing. ¶ when the time is right ¶ you're alone in the pantry. What is it? If you're upset about me and luc, don't be. We had a really good chat last night. We're gonna be fine. It's not that, is it? No. I... I was just thinking. Oh. Okay. Sarah. hmm? I want to tell you something. Motherhood never gets easier, even when they're grown. No one ever told me that, and I... I just wanted to make sure I- I told you. Thanks, mom. Hiya! Hiya! What the hell is that? Oh, you gotta see this. It might even cheer you up. Come. Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! So you must visualize the attack and use the move to defend yourself. Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya. Hiya. Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Osu. Osu. Good job. What are they doing? Good job. Keep practicing. Having their own relationship. Again. Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! God. I didn't even know mom was in town. Did you know she was in town? Yeah I did. She was visiting Eunice. - She called you? - Nora, I called her. The point is that... That she's doing great. It's a miracle that it's only a sprained ankle. What the hell is she doing with her hair these days? Maybe she changed salons or her girl moved away. I remember... I don't know who you are. Your mother takes to wandering the streets, she gets hit by a bus and you talk about is who's doing her hair? Hospitals make me anxious. Hospitals or mom? Both. Mr. Holden. Dr. Lewis, hi. This is my sister Nora. Your mother's doing fine. Can you tell us what happened? We don't have much to go on. It wasn't until an hour or so ago that she was speaking coherently. Really? Can you... Tell us a little bit more about this disorientation? Tell me, how has she been? Has she seemed confused? She would call me and, with questions about things that I thought she should've known the answer to. Actually, the truth is, we both live here. - She lives in New Mexico... - Alone. That's gonna have to change. Disorientation like this is a serious problem... She's a danger to herself. She's a danger to others. God forbid, she has one of these episodes, she gets behind the wheel of a car... So what you're saying is that we should either send her to a home - or, a live-in nurse. - I recommend 24-hour care. What that looks like is up to you and your mother, but I will say this... It may be more than either of you want to take on by yourselves. But I cannot release her until I know what your plan is. - Thanks. - Thank you. Just take your time. So who gets to tell her? Wake up. - What is it? Is it Evan? - No. Evan is fine. Evan is asleep. But you are not gonna believe this. It started. - What are you doing up? - I've a fund-raiser in Anaheim at 8:00. Do you not remember anything? I mean, come on, Robert. Get with the program and read this. "Too sick to serve"... All about my cancer, all about your heart attack. And they use the word "hubris" a lot. Bummer. Did you just say "bummer"? This is exactly the kind of thinking that just cost you a job. - Wow - Yeah, right? Carver hit a walk-off in extra innings. I shouldn't have turned that game off. You're talking about baseball? Honey this is serious. - What do you wanna do about it? - I can think of a couple of things that I would like to do about it. Why are you taking this lying down? Because it's 5:30 in the morning. Just let this go. That's it? That, and I've gotta have more faith in the team. What are you doing awake? It's still dark outside? So when you think of Robert {\and you think of}me, do you think about death? Why? What happened? The blogs are just calling us "the catastrophe couple of California." And you want to hear the weirdest part? Robert is flatlining. He's not even taking it in,{\He's not even} reacting. He's pretending that he's concerned about the baseball scores. - That doesn't sound like Robert. - Thank you. Robert just lost a job because of this kind of discrimination. You can't not hire somebody because they have heart surgery. - Look at Dick Cheney. - Ah, Dick Cheney. There's a reason I should move to France with Luc. Why don't you and Luc get married? I've been through this. I'm not gonna let Luc's visa - be a reason I get remarried. - Have you made any more appeals? Are you kidding me? We've done everything we can. He's even in a lottery for a green card. I've written letters, e-mails, left messages. God knows if they ever get them. Easy does it. It's all gonna work out. You {\and Luc}are completely committed to each other. He's leaving his stuff there? Which, when this doesn't work, I'll have to ship all the way back to France. Listen, you guys are gonna visit each other. It's gonna be great. Visit? Come on. Big whoop. You know as well as I do that absence does not make the heart grow fonder. It just makes you realize that you can live your lives without each other. I don't want to live my life without him, and now I'm gonna cry again all over my spreadsheets. I cried in three meetings yesterday? One of them was to raise capital at a merchant bank. Maybe I just need to get my period. Gosh. Hang on. It's Kevin. - Hi. What are you doing up? - I couldn't sleep, I need some advice. Be quick about it cause I've got Sarah on the other line. When you were pregnant, what was your HCG level? What? I can't hear you? I have to be quiet. I promised Scotty I wouldn't go online, but I can't stop reading these forums. Your HCG level, what was it? - I don't know. I just peed on a stick. - Ours is 53. Michelle's going for a second test{\ today}, but it has to be double. It'd be so much easier if we were straight? We'd do a daily boob check and see if she was pregnant or not. - That's it. - What's it? - I gotta go. - Wait... Did you just tell me that you haven't gotten your period yet? - No. And it's not helping things. - Cause you know what? You and I are on the same cycle, I got mine, like, a week and a half ago, so you are late. You are very, very late. Really? You haven't been this emotional since you were pregnant with Cooper. The love of my life is moving to the other side of the world. Besides, come on, I'm 43. I'm more likely to be perimenopausal than I am to be pregnant. Please. People get pregnant in their 40s all the time. Not me... because I happen to be part of the catastrophe couple, but you... I'm not having this conversation. My God. This is gonna be so much fun. This is perfect. Evan's gonna have a new little playmate. Okay. Good-bye. Hello? If you called her at this hour to have her assess the tenderness of her breasts - I'm gonna kill you. - I'm not even on the phone. You are googling HCG levels, aren't you? It's better than what most people do at odd hours on a computer. Did you know 73% of people 10 days post-transfer who get a 53 end up with a BFN? Big fat negative. You heard what the doctor said. We're supposed to stay off the internet. Our situation is unique to us. Everybody's results are {\gonna be}different. - I heard the doctor. - Okay. Then why don't you look up movie times? It'll take our mind off things until Michelle calls. Okay, fine. What do you want to see? Want to go to a psychic? How's that gonna take things off our mind? You wanna ask a stranger if {\she thinks}we're pregnant? No, but, you know, it'd be fun. Ms. Nadine... World renowned... Psychic to the stars. World renowned? Why do you want to know the gory details? Because, mother, you could've been killed. Now we just want to know what happened. That's all. Fine. I left Chicago... Chicago? No, mother. This is Los Angeles. The show, you morons. The musical "Chicago"? Eunice and I went with her senior citizens group. Now if we could just please fill out this damn form so that I can get home. The doctor said that you couldn't remember anything about what happened, so... What's going on? Nothing, mommy. We're worried about you. That's all. You should honestly try to call us when you're thinking of coming to town. - Saul knew I was here. - Only because he happened to call you. At least someone calls me. We have to think about the future. What about it? Mother, listen. The doctors... They feel that you shouldn't be living by yourself any longer. Why, because I sprained my ankle? No, because apparently, you were in the middle of the road and didn't even know it. {\They said that}You weren't yourself for hours. They're worried that this could happen again. I lose my way for a couple of hours in a city I don't know, and you want to box me up and send me to a nursing home? That's where this is headed, right? You need help. Fine, Sauly. I'll move in with you. I don't think so. My house is small, I have work, and I just don't think you'd be happy there. You can live with me. Please, mother. Please live with me. I'd like that. I would rather live in a nursing home. Yes, I'm sorry you feel that way. But you're coming home with me. {\fade(2500,100)}{\1cHFF9933}Season 04 Episode 21 Where There's Smoke... {\***pub***}{\pos(192,220)}We got the bread maker that we registered for. {\pos(192,220)}The bread maker?

You know that's not the reason that I can't have her live with me. And what would be the reason for me to tell her. - At this point in my life that I'm gay? - It's the truth. - Nice. Nice. - I'm gonna call the kids. I'm gonna tell 'em they have to have dinner with us tonight. We have to, all of us, get used to the idea that Ida's gonna be staying here, hopefully for a very, very long time. I'm seeing a journey. A voyage of some sort. Are these the stars you referenced in your ad? I'm sorry. I've never seen these people. I'm sorry. You were saying something about a journey? It's not for you, but for someone close, perhaps a family member... My God. That's totally Luc. My sister-in-law's boyfriend, visa issues. Doe's that ring a bell? - I think you just rang it for her. - That would make sense, but before he leaves something else is coming. Don't tell her. This thing I see coming... It's a big, dark cloud. I can't tell you what it is, but it's going to bring turmoil and maybe... Even smoke. Smoke? I thought psychics only brought good news. That's a fortune cookie. But for what it's worth, I am sensing new life. Like a baby? What? That's what we're here for. Now that I know what it is, yes, it's a baby. Kevin, did you hear that? I was just about to get you that sales report. Actually, could I ask you a question? Do you remember that meeting last month where I kind of flipped out - because... - your nonfat dry cap wasn't very dry? PMS. Do you remember when that was exactly? - March 11th. - Wow. You're good with dates. It was my birthday. Sorry. My God. Six weeks. I wish we could have lunch, but they've got me on this ridiculous schedule, I have to be back at the state department first thing in the morning. No, that's okay. It sounds worse than the campaign trail. I hear you've got a good shot at the primary. Ann, I need a favor. If you're looking to secure more RNC funding, - I've already targeted you... - No, actually, it's about Robert. What about him? I'm guessing that you know that he was tapped for a high-level appointment concerning national security. And... He went through the whole process, and they practically told him that he had the job, and then at the last minute, they rejected him because of some leftover scar tissue from his heart surgery and... - Right. - Wait a minute. Did you hear something different? If that's what Robert told you, then he's in the best position to know. If he is interested in a think tank or a seat on the board... Please don't change the subject. What is going on? Look, all I'm gonna say is that there are plenty of people in worse health than Robert at the highest levels. A little scar tissue isn't usually a deal breaker. I'm sorry. I have a car waiting. You did this. You killed the job. You had me blackballed. Look, if you'd taken that appointment, you'd have been gagged. You'd take an oath of silence and never be able to help us. We couldn't let that happen. There are plenty of people who could help you do this. You know you're the perfect candidate. Even if I wanted to, my wife is running for senate. There's no way that I'm gonna jeopardize... Your loyalty is admirable. Family is important, but your country needs you. - My country? - Yes. Your country. Joe, find someone else. {\***pub***}200 bucks down the drain, and I still don't feel distracted. {\pos(192,220)}But you should be relieved. Kevin, we're totally pregnant. {\pos(192,220)}What, is that based on the tenderness of my breasts? {\pos(192,220)}She was dead-on about a lot of things. Luc... {\pos(192,220)}- cause you told her about Luc. - She said "journey" first. {\pos(192,220)}And then there was that whole thing about new life. {\pos(192,220)}And could she have been any more generic? My God. The wicked witch of the west is in town. - Who? - Grandma. She's gonna be at mom's.{\ tonight.} Wait. Ida's here? She's the dark force. She's totally the dark force bringing turmoil. Ida's cranky, okay? A dark force? Kind of a stretch. - Smoke... What was that about? - Clouds. We could paint clouds on the ceiling of the nursery. I don't think predictions count if you make them come true. Plus, we don't have a nursery. Kevin, I just want to believe. So... Are you all set here? All set. There's nothing else that you need? That's what is meant by "all set." You know, mom... You really could come with me. I'm just shopping for dinner, and it would be like old times. Remember when we used to shop at Hannigan's and we used to sample all the candies? Don't patronize me. If you're afraid that I'm gonna wander out in the street and get hit by another bus, just say so. I really wasn't patronizing you. It would be nice to have your company. We could spend some time together. Were you planning on carrying me around the market or do I just sit in the car with bingo? Bingo died. I had no idea. When? Just, you know, a little while ago. Listen to me. I would really, really like you to come with me. I'd rather not miss my programs. So you have my cell phone number. Okay. What time should I feed bingo? Go shopping. It was a joke. Good. Hello? - What's going on? - Not much. Just thought about emptying the trash. Actually, you really should be getting ready, because we shouldn't be late tonight. Grandma's coming. Did I tell you that? Have you met Ida? Don't be crazy. {\Of course}You haven't. What am I talking about? - What? - You're so nervous. Yeah, a little bit. But I'm holding it together. Babe, I'm gonna call you every night. It would be lunchtime for you. That way we can have lunch together. You know people do move on with their lives. I'm worried we might get distracted. No, I'm not gonna get distracted. Do you remember when we met the first time? You just appeared on my doorstep. Come on. We're meant to be together. Let's make the most of the time we have left? No. You know what? Sex is not always the answer. It can have very serious ramifications. - What? - Come on, I shouldn't really have to explain to you... The birds and the bees, kids. Kids. What do you mean? Do you want to have a baby? - No. Why? Do you? - I don't know. I'm leaving in a day. - I don't think it's really practical... - Exactly. You're leaving tomorrow. It's not practical. You should go get ready for dinner. I take out the trash. No, I'll get it. Got it. Let me take out the trash. Please. I'm here one more day. Could you please stop saying that? Let me take out the trash, then. God. Mom? {\***pub***} - Thank you. - No problem. Thank you so much. I promise I'll be careful next time. Never let it happen again. {\pos(192,220)}You could have told them I did it. {\pos(192,220)}I don't think they would have locked me up. No, mother, it's not your fault. You did turn the burner on and walk away, but I should not leave so much stuff around. This could have happened to anyone. Fine. We'll play it your way. Ah, jeez! Just don't say it. Don't say it. Don't say it. We're fine. Everyone is fine. We needn't change our plans. You couldn't call me? I had to hear it from Sarah? I knew you were coming over for dinner tonight. - It's not like I'm keeping it a secret. - I'm just glad everything's okay and the house is still standing. Mommy, you okay? I'm peachy. It was her fault. We're having pizza tonight. Was there a fire? Everybody's okay. - It's true. - Everybody's safe. It's fine. - So there was smoke. - Can you smell that? I love you. It's true. It's really true. Excuse me. Is there something wrong with the two of you? No, we're just glad everyone's okay. Is there a chip or something? I'm just checking to see if it's the same company that we registered for. I've been obsessed with dinnerware. We've received so many wedding gifts, we've no idea where to{\we're gonna}put everything. Buy a house. You're married. That's what people do. Actually, there is this one house that we love. I didn't know med school paid so well. We're not actually in the market. Who knows? If things turn around with Ojaï. But I mean, we love our apartment. Don't get me wrong. There's plenty of room. Our place is tiny, and we're adding a baby to the mix. - You've heard? Did you hear something? - No. I just meant at some point. And hopefully, the fates are with us. Sarah, you okay? I'm just... - Gonna get wine for the table. - There's a bottle right here. I was so sorry to hear about bingo. Your dog. Your mother mentioned that he passed recently. Grandma... Bingo passed away about 20 years ago. I didn't say it was yesterday. No, you said "recently." Why, so that I would feel better? I don't know. Is that such a bad thing? No, of course not, dear. It's one of the wonderful things about you. - You're such a pleaser. - Mom, come on. Like taking blame for the fire that I caused. Mother, look, everyone is safe. No one got hurt. It doesn't matter whose fault it was. It matters to me, damn it. - Hello? - Kitty, come in here. Did you take the test? I bought the test, but then Luc came home. I had to throw it in the trash. {\Wait a minute.}Are you telling me that Luc doesn't know? - You have to tell him. - Tell him what? What's there to tell? There's nothing to tell. Even if there was, - he's leaving tomorrow. - I am here to tell you that this is not something that you should be keeping from your partner. You are in a committed relationship. You don't keep secrets from each other. No wonder you think the long-distance thing isn't gonna work. I might be hormonal, but it feels like you're being really mean to me. - He's French. I have two kids. - I know. I'm sorry. It's not you, okay? It's not you. It's me. It's me. I went to see this woman today... to confront her about why Robert didn't get the job. You went to see Ann Waterman? Have you been eavesdropping outside that door? - A little. At the end. - Wait a minute. Did Robert ever tell you anything about some sort of job in intelligence? The job? The big secret job? God, yeah. What about it? I went to see Ann Waterman today, because I wanted to talk to her about how I thought it was discrimination that Robert didn't get the job cause of his heart surgery, she looked at me like I was crazy. Meaning? I think there's another reason why Robert didn't get the job. You think there's a scandal that you don't know about? Let's just turn the dial down on the drama queen. - Maybe he was embarrassed. - You know him. He doesn't get embarrassed. He wasn't born with the ability to get - What? - Can we not talk about birth, please? Right. Right. Sorry. Sorry. Has Scotty said something to you two? About what? My God. Are you pregnant, too? What do you mean, "too"? Who else is pregnant? I don't know. - Who's pregnant? - Nobody I never said anybody's pregnant You said "too." "Too" implies somebody else is pregnant. It was... I meant "boo." So who's the first person? Kevin? - What? - Are you pregnant? We went to a psychic, and she predicted a "new life." But maybe that new life isn't ours. Maybe it's one of yours. So tell me, is it? Is it? Is one of you pregnant? So the birds and the bees... You were serious? It is you. - Maybe. I don't know. - But it might be? - That would be amazing. - It's not amazing. It's not amazing. You're leaving tomorrow. And we were careful. We were really, really careful. - I thought we were. - You thought you were being careful? - What {\the hell}is your problem? - Are we okay in here? No, we're not. The new life? - It's her. It's Sarah. - What? She stole our baby. You're... - Ma, you want some more salad? - Bye, mom! Bye, gram! - What, is Kevin leaving? - It sounded like that. - Excuse me. - What's going on? Nothing. Thank you for the dinner. We just really have to go. You guys aren't leaving, too. Justin's getting the ice cream. The sitter... We have to relieve her. I thought the kids were with their father this weekend. - Right. Good night. - Good night. I'm gonna find out what's going on. I honestly don't know where that instinct comes from. What instinct is that? The one that tells you that you have to fix everything. Who knows what's going on out there? They're adults. If they need you, they'll ask you. Come on. It's perfectly understandable for Nora to want to find out - what's happening. - I'm sorry, if I don't do things the way you did. I just want to be there for my children, that's all. You're right. We've always done things differently. Can we not do this now, please? We're going to do this now. I don't want to live in this house with you for the next ten years of my life. There's a place called fair willows. - We've been over this. - You have been over this. Allow me the dignity to make my own choices. Allow me that, before it's too late. {\***pub***}Please, don't try and get my hopes up again. You should have left me to my blogs and {\pos(192,220)}my "dreams of motherhood" forums full of ectopic pregnancies, BFN's {\pos(192,220)}and people just acknowledging what a huge miracle it is to get pregnant. {\pos(192,220)}At least that way, I'd have been able to manage my expectations {\pos(192,220)}wrap my head around the disappointment. {\pos(192,220)}{ o,}You wouldn't have. Even if she turns out not to be pregnant, Ms. Nadine or no Ms. Nadine, it's still going to hurt. There's no way to soften that blow. I don't think I can handle it without it being softened. Yes, you can, because I will be right here with you. Maybe this is just a sign that it's not meant to be. You're trying to soften again. If we really wanna be parents, maybe we could get a dog. I like dogs. For a woman who is supposedly diminished, she certainly knows how to turn it on when she wants to. She sure does. But she's right, Nora. She is. It's her choice how and where she spends the rest of her life. She doesn't want to live here with me. That's what this is about. I know that you want to have a relationship with her, but you've tried. You've tried. But then I'll never have a relationship with her like you do. What do I have with her? Tell me. I have a lie. The only reason you think that I'm close with mother is cause I don't fight her. I can't live honestly in front of her. I've never been able to. But you do. You're yourself. And I envy that, because that's something I'll never have. Really? Yeah, really. - If I send her off... - When you send her off. - When I send her off... - Right. We can't let this be a new precedent in the family. Because I'm gonna live with Kitty or Sarah. Better yet, I'm living with Kevin. No one's gonna ship me off. Okay, I'll have the family bylaws revised on monday... And I'll make sure it says that. Looks like you and Evan had some fun. He is gonna be a drummer pretty soon. How was dinner? Dinner... was fine. You know, dinner with my family. You know how it is. Wait a second. You had Ida, Nora and Saul all in the same room, so it must have been great so spill it. I went to see Ann Waterman today. - Why would you do that? - Cause I think you're lying to me. - What exactly did Ann tell you? - Nothing. She didn't tell me anything. It was very clear that she was hiding something, so I'm assuming you are, too. Someone intervened... and prevented me from getting the job. The heart attack was just an excuse. Who intervened? People. Powerful people. - You knew that they did this? - Not until today. They lied to me, too. I don't understand. Who's "they"? Who'd wanna prevent you from getting this job? - I can't get into it. - Come on. I am your wife. Remember? We promised we weren't gonna keep any secrets from each other? Here I am in the middle of a campaign, and I wanna know. Is something gonna come out,{\all of a sudden} something that's gonna surprise me? {\Why is exactly why you cannot know anything about this.} - Stay away from it. - There's going to be an investigation? They want me to help them with something... Having the job would prevent that. It's not like there aren't good motives behind what they're doing. It's just that I... Am not sure that I wanna be a part of it. You need to tell them that... you don't want anything to do with it and they should get somebody else. I did. I told them exactly that. I'll get him. - So you doing it? - I should have had more to drink. I was trying to avoid the wine. You know that, women in France, - drink wine when they're pregnant. - That explains a lot. I'm sorry, but... I just can't believe this. I didn't know I wanted a family. I already have a family. I know you do. One that includes me. Sarah, that could be such a great thing. And like you said, the distance is so hard. - But now we... - But what? You said you thought this would be no problem. I know. But the truth is, it will be a little hard. People get busy, move on with their own lives. What are you saying? You think we need a baby to help keep us together? - What happened to all your optimism? - Look, I'm nervous, too. But a baby... A baby will hold us together no matter where we are. We'd be a family. That's what I really want for us. I'm sorry to hear that because it's negative. I'm not pregnant. It's such a shame it's so un-PC to buy a dog. - Look at that goldendoodle. - My God. So cute. - Maybe we can rescue one. - I don't think goldendoodles need rescuing. Hi, Michelle. Wait... Before you say anything, we just... We want you to know, we're so grateful for everything you're going through for us, and no matter what happens, there's no blame, there's no... - 461? - 461? - That's her HCG level. She's pregnant. - We're pregnant! - My God. - We're pregnant. Just enjoying the perks of being without child. I was just... Don't tell me that you were trying to make me feel better{\about that, too,} cause then I'll have to reevaluate everything you've ever said{\to me}. I wasn't. I was excited. This is not the first time I thought I got someone pregnant. Not what I need to hear right now. But this is the first time I felt the way I felt. It's because I'm in love with you. And this is why it's gonna work. But neither of us actually believe that 100%, do we? I'm moving 6,000 miles away. - It's gonna be a big change, but... - It's gonna suck. No, we're going in eyes wide-open. But this is what I want. - You want this, right? - Of course I do. So then we're gonna make it work. You're right. I'm sorry. We will. {\***pub***}You really do come to all of these? As much as I can. He seems like he was a hell of a soldier. He was. Since I've been back, he's done three tours of duty. Three. A place like this, sometimes it's hard not to feel guilty for what you have. It makes me wonder, since I've been back what the hell I've been doing. You served your country with honor. You're studying to be a doctor. But there are a shortage of medics out there now. Sometimes I feel this call to serve, something bigger Than my little corner of the world, you know? Yeah, I do know. Okay, we're almost set. I just have to find my damn cell phone. I spoke with the nicest lady at fair willows, and she... Eunice, slow down. What? It's a charter bus. They're not gonna leave without us. And the show doesn't even start till 2:00. Mom, it's me, Nora. Yes. Thank you. My daughter. I gotta call her. If she knew that I was here in California and didn't call her... Though she's probably got a million things going on... Always so busy. And I don't ever want to become a burden to her. Maybe she's not so busy that she wouldn't love to hear from you. It's those children. They're fully grown, but they still keep her on her toes. But... They're wonderful. How could they not be with a mother like that? Baby names? When did you have time to get these? A couple weeks ago. Look at you, Mr. Quietly confident. I knew all along. Forget Ms. Nadine. Looks like you find your calling. Okay, you're all packed, pretty sparingly. I won the lottery. You what? I won the lottery. - You got a green card. - It just arrived. You got a green card. - Harmony Wandell. - Augustus Walker. - You know what? - We're never agree on a baby name? No. Ms. Nadine's predictions... There's one outstanding... You know, the one about a loved one making a journey. It's gotta be your grandma. I guess. Okay, I've got everything. Do you want to wear your coat or shall I pack it? If I wanted to pack it, I would have packed it. Use your head. Good point, mom. Good point. I'm glad to get your call. I'm wheels up in five. - I don't have much time. - I changed my mind. Why? I started thinking that I should be worrying about something bigger than my corner of the world. - Are you sure? - I'm in. You've made the right decision. Let's hope so. {\fade(2500,100)}{\1cHFF9933}The Walker Team Pour WOMAN: I have to be honest. I'm starting to tire of the dry chicken dinners. Every year I find myself in the same stuffy room, sitting on the same uncomfortable chair, being asked to open my checkbook yet again. Now, I support this facility, I really do, but I have to ask, Dr. Proctor: When can we expect MT1 to stand on its own two feet. PROCTOR: It's a good question... Ms. Davis. Ms. Kimberly Davis. Uh, Ms. Davis. Um... I'm sure I'd be, uh, more articulate if I were doing this in a surgical mask, but, um, Dr. Willis here insisted that bringing potential donors into the operating room would be both unhygienic and... more than a little odd. So, um... why have a... trauma-only facility when it costs so much, uh, to keep open and, um, uses... so many resources? (exhales) (chuckles softly) What's the first thought that comes into your mind when you drive by an accident? (girls laughing) Most people think, um... "What happened?" In the past tense. (tires screech) Whoa, hey! Watch it! (tires screech) In their minds, the accident's already over. Those of us who work in trauma we see the... flashing lights of the ambulance, and we think, "What's happening?" In the present. 'Cause for us, it's only just the beginning. âa Who's in a bunker?

Now I've got a question for you all. Which of the patients... didn't survive to the end of our shift?

And what does it say about me that I can't open a childproof cap? You know, we got incoming in five. Auto versus bike versus auto. You have a run-in with Juan Valdez? (laughs) Yeah. Did I mention I spilled a macchiato in front of the very tasty waiter at my diner? Mucho, mucho embarazada. Uh, "embarazada" is "pregnant," Chris. But yes, (laughs) embarazado. Embarrassing. Hey, you two get your flu shots yet? Uh-uh. Cathy's down. Churny called in sick with a fever. In that case, looks like I'm getting a flu shot. Because to become sick and yurk all over the place would be very embarazado. Hey, Dr. Zambrano, did you, uh, lose something? Oh, God, no. Oh, it must have fallen off. It's my mother's earring. It's the only thing of hers I still have. It must have (beeping) fallen off at the diner. (sighs): I-I-I got to go. I got to go change. No, no. You go get on incoming. I'll take care of Goodwill; you make a mental list of everywhere the earring might have fallen off. I love you. You know that, right? Yes. I-I've left you three messages, Matt. Which I ignored, because you used the word "fund-raiser"" Which is something I promised I wouldn't do when I took the job. Yeah, but this is sort of an emergency. No. That is an emergency. One I actually need to attend to. Eric Schwartz, 25. Auto versus ped with severe head injury. Awake but altered. BP: 180/90. Heart rate: 130. Three fingers. Three fingers. How you doing, Eric? Was he riding without a helmet? Came off when he flipped his bike. He took a direct impact. He hasn't stopped answering how many fingers am I holding up since I asked him on the scene. Okay, on my count-- one, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. He's perseverating. Eric... One, two, three. One, two, three. Your brain is rebooting itself over and over again. We'll sort that out as soon as we can. Someone page Neurosurge, have mannitol standing by. Eric, is there anybody we can contact, a family member? No Mom. Not Mom. Br-brother Joey. Not Mom. Joey. Got it, Eric. Do you have his cell phone, Kleebus? With his stuff. I'll find a Joey. Agniska Vivika, mid-20's, restrained passenger in an MVA with a crush injury to the abdomen and pelvis, right leg fracture and a deep arm laceration. Given five of morphine. Agniska? Doesn't speak English. (speaking foreign language) Russian? DELEO: I don't know, a lot of consonants-- maybe Czech? Passport says she's Polish. DELEO: Arm bleed stopped with pressure, but it's definitely gonna have to be explored by Vascular in the O.R. Also, a lot of bruising on the abdomen. Agniska, we're gonna get you a translator as soon as we can, okay? (speaking Polish) She has diffuse guarding. (crying in pain) Yeah, pelvis is really unstable. It's definitely gonna need surgery. Let's get another five of morphine. And a call to Admin. For a trans... for a translator. ZAMBRANO: You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Oh! Oh! And the flu strikes again, huh? I'm so sorry. Don't worry, just... just go home, okay? Tuck will get someone to cover. And I'll start the ultrasound while you go and clean up. No, I'll... No, no, I got it. Just, uh, go. Go. (chuckles) (scoffs) This day couldn't get worse. (sighs) Oh, sir. You can't be in here. Your foot. Please... I don't want to use this. That makes two of us. Where was I? There was a gun in Trauma? Don't you people have security? So this is how the foot injury became a trauma case? Are you taking notes? Oh, absolutely. I'm gonna figure out who died. Pretty sure it's the homeless guy. Always the guy you least expect. Yes, gun. Yes, in Trauma. Yes, security, but not enough. And even if we had run the homeless guy through a metal detector, it wouldn't have found the weapon. Why not? Sorry. I don't mean to scare you. Well, it'd help if you put the gun down. I can't do that. Okay. Could I at least take a look at your foot? Stay back. I'm just trying to help. That's what they said at the other building. You mean the ER? They said that they were going to fix my foot, then I saw the cameras-- they were watching me! Are there cameras in here, too? ER wants us to keep an eye out for a foot laceration who skipped out. Think I found him. Yup. Think so. Stay back. Hey, hey, why don't you take it easy. What do you say we put the gun down before someone ends up needing to go to a trauma hospital. See, that's why I didn't want to come back here. What do you mean, back here? You been here before? Hey, I know you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You were there when they did this to me. It's a water gun. (Zambrano cries out) Are you okay? You all right? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Go, go. Whoa-whoa-whoa, sorry, sorry. Hey, someone stop that guy! Hey! Someone call security! I went through Eric's cell. I couldn't find a number for the brother, Joey, but I found one for his mother, Leslie. Thanks, Kleebus. Mrs. Schwartz? I'm Dr. Warren. You're a doctor? Yes, a first year resident. Eric's in critical condition. He was injured on his bike. Oh, God! But his vitals are stable and his head CT scan shows no bleeding. Now, he does have significant brain swelling, so we're prepping him for surgery to relieve that pressure. Our chief, Dr. Proctor, is in surgery with Eric. I'm going to scrub in, and as soon as we have any update, I'll let you know. Does she know anything about Eric? Uh, D-Dr. Warren was just giving me an update. You're a doctor? Dr. Warren, this is my son, um... Joey, right? Joey? How do you know about Joey? Eric gave Joey It's okay, Mom. as a contact. Why would Eric be asking for Joey? Relax, Mom. I'm Eric's younger brother, Scott. I've been staying in town with my mother since... Joey died in an accident six months ago. I'm really sorry. LESLIE: Please, Dr. Warren. I can't lose another son. I understand, Mrs. Schwartz. (monitor whooshing) How's Agniska doing? Agniska's got fluid pooling behind her liver. Her bladder looked irregular. Ruptured? What happened to your face? Just... water gun incident. Don't ask. Bladder rupture, liver laceration. DELEO: Pelvic and tibia fracture, brachial artery injury. Let's get a retrograde urethrogram to confirm the bladder rupture and have ortho, urology and vascular scrub in for the other issues. (speaks Polish) Can we get a damn translator in here? (speaking Polish) Whoa, sir. (speaking Polish) Are you the translator? No, Bolek Dabrowski-- he's the husband of the driver of the car. I was told that my wife preachers... ..or their prophets. You know that. Yes, of course, I know that. The Sanhedrin, whose co-operation has been very useful to us,... ..consider it extremely important. Even urgent. Urgent? ! Urgent to whom? ! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Maybe next week. But first... ..we'II deal with Barabbas. PiIate, there's a delegation from the Sanhedrin waiting outside. It is led by Zerah himself. They have this preacher, this Jesus of Nazareth, with them. They want you to judge him. Judge him? Zerah himself? It must be important. No. No, no, no. I don't want to get involved in their religious quarrels. This is the monthly report of the province. It's wise not to offend them unnecessarily. I think you should see them. well, have them brought in. Don't stand there. Bring them in. PiIate, I regret... I'm afraid we must go out to them. We must go to them? Yes, according to their... ..beliefs... well, they cannot come into a house of a Roman,... ..not on Passover. They would be defiled. DefiIed. I forgot about that. AII right. We'II go to them. Bring them to the Great hall. How does one govern such people? Procurator,... ..we have found that this man, Jesus of Nazareth,... ..distorts our people's views on the relationship between God and the state. Furthermore, he perverts the very heart of our religion. I'm not concerned with your religious laws. My function as governor here is to keep the peace and administer Roman justice. We know that, Procurator, but this man also threatens the established order. If he were not a criminal, we would not have brought him to you. He calls himself the Christ, which means the Anointed One. Thank you. I too know some Greek. What else has he done? Has he spoken against the Emperor or against Rome? well, Procurator, not directly, no, but... Not directly? Then you'II have to judge him according to your Law. Procurator, for us this man Jesus is a blasphemer. If we were a seIf-governing nation, we'd have the right to exact punishment... ..under the Law of Moses. He entered JerusaIem calling himself the King of the Jews! A claim we totally reject! King of the Jews? well, whatever else he may have done, such a claim is treason. True, too. AII right, all right. I'II talk to him. Your Jesus! Not ours. Then whose? Whose? ! Bring him in! Is this the man you think so dangerous? This? The man that aspires to be a king? Come. Come, come, come! Now,... ..the leaders of the Sanhedrin accuse you of preaching perverted doctrines. Come. They also say you call yourself the King of the Jews. well, are you King of the Jews? If my kingdom were of this world,... ..my followers would have fought to prevent me from being captured. Oh, you speak of a kingdom. Therefore you must be a king. Are you a king? I am. I was born for one purpose. To bear witness to the truth. AII who can accept the truth hear my voice. And what is... ..the truth? Hm! No, this man's no criminal. He's a dreamer. Take him away! Have him flogged as a token of Roman justice. That should wake him up. Procurator,... ..we, the leaders of the Sanhedrin,... ..have always had the same aim as you: The peaceful administration of our country for the good of our people, and... Oh, please, please, please! Don't talk to me about the people. As long as they obey,... ..you care as much about your children of israel... ..as we do the mob in Rome. Now, Zerah,... ..let us speak... directly. Why does the Sanhedrin... ..consider this man so dangerous... ..that they send you yourself here to make sure that he is condemned? Perhaps for the same reasons as you. If you knew him as well as we do,... ..you would also find him dangerous. That's enough! Put his clothes back on. I saw him enter JerusaIem as a king! Look at him now! He's a king? ! The King of the Jews! We should dress him like a king. - Give me your cloak. - Don't use mine. Use one of those. Here it is! Come on! Here we are. Turn around. Look at him! Hey, wait! If he's a king,... ..he needs a crown. hall, Your Majesty! High and mighty Majesty! (laughter) I have it! A king's crown! Look what he's got! He's got his crown! - He needs a sceptre. - Majesty! A perfect fit, Your Majesty. Now he's the king! Tiberius will be getting worried! (scraping) Ecce homo. behold the man. well? What have you got to say for yourself now? Speak! Who are you? What are you? well, say something! Don't you want to defend yourself? Do you want to die? ! Don't you realise I have the power to release you or have you crucified? ! You would have no power over me... ..if it had not been given you from above. QuintiIius... Isn't there an ancient custom... ..honouring Passover... ..where the Procurator can release a prisoner... ..sentenced to death... ..as an act of mercy? Yes. That custom still exists. And we have two prisoners? - Barabbas? - And Jesus. So let the people decide. I've made my decision. The people will decide. - Zerah... - (soldier) Take him away! (Quintilius) Get down to the prison and bring Barabbas. Barabbas, remember? Barabbas! Good. Here, here! Listen to me! You two! When I give you the cue, you shout for Barabbas. Barabbas is depending on you. He has fought for you. Shout for Barabbas. No, we must save Jesus! - When did they arrest him? - Last night in the garden of Gethsemane. - That's near where I Iive! - Be prepared. Barabbas must be freed at all costs. Now look, we can put our men all over. Do you understand? Do you understand? We meet at the temple. (fanfare) As a sign... ..of his magnanimity... ..and his benevolence,... ..our divine Emperor has decided... ..that the custom of releasing... ..one prisoner,... ..sentenced to death,... ..in honour of your Passover,... ..shall continue. We have... ..two prisoners. One,... ..Jesus of Nazareth,... ..accused of treason,... ..by proclaiming himself... ..King of the Jews. Can you work a miracle now, Jesus? ! Ha-ha-ha! Anyone shouting for him had better watch out. - Look at him, the King of the Jews! - What's happened to him? call yourself a king? ! Or... ..Barabbas,... ..accused of sedition and murdering a Roman auxiliary. That's the man they call the Son of God? ! Barabbas! Barabbas! Free Barabbas! He's one of us! - Freedom for Barabbas! - Why don't you free yourself, Jesus! Which... ..of the two... ..shall be released to you? Jesus of Nazareth,... - This must not happen! - ..guilty of proclaiming himself... - .. King of the Jews,... - Look, he's wearing a crown! ..or... ..Barabbas? (cheering) - release Jesus! He is the true prophet! - (crowd shouting) - He's our saviour! release him! - Jesus is a man sent from God! Free Barabbas! false prophet! He betrayed us! kill the Nazarene! Jesus! Jesus! We want Barabbas! Free Barabbas! Barabbas! Jesus! Jesus! - Barabbas! - Jesus! Shut up, you slut! Jesus! Free him! Take the Nazarene! He's a false prophet! Free Barabbas! We can't let him go. - We can't let Barabbas get away. - Yes. - The soldiers won't like that! - Wait... PiIate,... ..you're not going to free Barabbas,... ..an assassin and enemy of Rome? I wonder... ..who is the real enemy? Jesus of Nazareth must be saved! Let it be written... ..that Jesus of Nazareth... ..is guilty of treason... ..by proclaiming himself... ..King of the Jews. And his sentence,... ..to be crucified. (cheering) release Barabbas now! Do not kill him! He is innocent! Mark, where's the Iast prisoner? Come on! Here's your man. Come on. Ah, the King of the Jews. - Hurry up, this crowd worries me. - Here, take him. (shouting) Come on! Make room! Make room! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! - He is a false prophet! - Is that justice? ! Get back! Get back! Make way! Have you no heart! Save yourself, Jesus! Keep this mob back! Use your spears! You betrayed us! You betrayed us! We believed you, and you betrayed us! Get back, you scum! Come on! Come on! He's a traitor! He's a prophet! Traitor! Crucify him! Oh, Lord! Argh! Argh! Arrest him! Arrest him! Take down that sign! It is an insult! He is not the King of the Jews! - Those are the orders we received! - Take down that sign! Out of the way! You cannot kill him! You have no right to do it! Now, all of you, stay back! Father,... ..forgive them. They know not what they do. Hey! - Who are you? - She is his mother. Can you prove it? Hey! She is his mother. Go to him. - And who are you? - please. I'm one of the family. Is that right? Yes. She is one of the family. Go, then. (man) The Romans won't let you get close. (women sobbing) John,... ..behold your mother. Woman,... ..behold your son. (thunder) He saved others. Why can't he save himself now? He was despised... ..and rejected of men. Man of sorrows,... ..and acquainted with grief. He was oppressed... ..and afflicted, yet... ..he opened not his mouth. He was brought as a lamb to slaughter,... ..and as a sheep... ..before its shearer is dumb... surely... ..he hath borne our griefs,... ..and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions,... ..he was abused for our iniquities,... ..and... through his wounds,... ..we are healed... ..and... ..born again.

We are the family of Jesus of Nazareth, who lies here. What do you want? To enter the tomb. Why? To anoint the body. To bring fresh linen,... ..herbs and spices. It is our custom. Why didn't you do that when you brought him here? (Martha) The Sabbath began. We could not buy them. What do you think? (soldier) They're only three women. Let them go. I suppose it'II be all right. You'II need an army to move that stone. AII right, then. Let's go together, but we'II need some help. Hey, LentuIus, wake up! Come with us! Marcus, you watch the bridge! AII those priests, too. Are they still around? Can't wait to get away from this place, back to Rome. Where are you going? Why do you seek the living among the dead? Jesus is not there. He's gone! Come! Jesus is not here. - Are you sure? - I swear by Jupiter, hercules and Mars! You've been awake all night and haven't moved. That's right! We were given strict orders. Nobody's been near that tomb. Those Jewish priests were with us all the time. well, then, who moved the stone? (knocking) (footsteps) - Who is it? - Me. philip. - Did anyone follow you? - No. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. Are they still looking for us? On every corner one sees temple guards and Roman soldiers. This place isn't safe. We must go somewhere else. - But where can we go? - I wish we could go to GaIiIee. Peter... Peter! tell us,... ..what should we do? We must do what the Master would have wanted. The Master's dead, Peter. (banging) - I thought you said you weren't followed! - I wasn't! - Mary... - Peter! AII of you,... ..I have seen him. (Matthew) Seen who? The Master. You've seen him? Yes. He is risen. I saw him. I saw him! This morning we went to the tomb, and near the tomb was a man... ..and a young boy. And the man said to me, "Why do you look for the living among the dead?" "Jesus is not here." So we went to the tomb and we saw the stone was upturned. The grave... the tomb was open. We looked for him. He was not there. - You mean his body wasn't there? - Has it been stolen? No, no, no. Let me finish. When we were leaving the cemetery,... ..I saw another man. He saw how distraught we were. He said, "Woman,... ..why do you weep?" And then he said my name. "Mary..." "Mary." And it was then that I saw... ..it was Jesus. I fell to my knees... ..and I reached for him. "Touch me not,... ..for I have not yet ascended to my Father", he said. "But go to my brothers,... ..and tell them." You don't believe me. You don't believe me! I tell you, I saw him! - It was our Lord! - Mary... Mary! John... Oh, John... You don't believe me. You! Mary... You're tired. please! please go. I saw him, John. I saw him. Women's fantasies. Fantasies? Was his death a fantasy? ! I saw him die! I was there and I wept at his feet! Why should he not then appear to me? ! He is risen. He told me to tell you,... ..and I have done so. You wouldn't believe her! When he raised Jairus's daughter, you didn't believe it! What do you mean? You believe her story? ! well, do any of you believe it? Do you, Andrew? Do you, James? And you, Matthew? ! Do you,... ..Peter? Yes. How can you? Because he said so. Because he wanted it to be so. He wanted everything to happen... ..just as it did. And I have always believed him. But... Peter,... ..you denied him. You denied him three times! Yes! I denied him because I was a coward! We are all cowards! We accused Judas of being a traitor, but we all betrayed him! We all... ..abandoned him. At least our brothers in the Sanhedrin who condemned him didn't know him! The Romans... ..did not know him. But we... We ate with him. We lived with him. We knew he was the Christ! And still we betrayed him! Brothers, don't you... can't you see? Thomas... You asked me if I believe he is risen. Yes, I do. For I know in my heart he will not... ..abandon us. I know in my heart he has forgiven me... Us. Forgiven all of us. This is precisely what I feared. His disciples must have removed the stone and taken away the body. impossible! I had guards here as you requested. And your priests were here, too. Now it begins. It all begins. It was written... ..the Son ofMan will suffer,... ..and on the third day... ..will rise again from the dead to enter his glory. You are my witnesses to this. Now my Father in heaven is reconciled to the world. And as he sent me... ..so I am sending you. Receive the holy Spirit. Go like lambs among wolves. Make disciples of all nations. Baptise them in the name of the Father,... ..and of the Son,... ..and of the holy Ghost. Teach them the gospel and the commandments I gave you. Now... ..I am leaving the world again,... ..and going to the Father. Oh, Lord, stay with us. The night is faIIing. The day is almost over. Don't be afraid. I am with you every day... ..till the end of time. Visiontext subtitles: Natasha Cohn helen Stewart HEADLIGHTS IN THE FOG Anna! Anna! C'mon, c'mon, Savona is a long ways away!

It's three. - I'll be here at seven to load, eh? - OK. OK then, seven o'clock here. - The boss wants you. - At this hour? - Meh. - The young men will not sleep tonight. - I guess not! Urgent job! But we just got here! I was going to sleep too, guys! It's load of diesel oil to La Spezia. There's a premium! It will be for you two. You take the new 666. You've seen what a beauty, huh? - The load is ready. - Sorry, I've got to go home briefly! - If it's about leaving at 7:00 as usual... - What 7:00? I told you it's urgent! In short, you don't want to go. For me... Alright! If you don't feel like it, I'll send Rico and Carlo. Well, send whoever you want. May be a big deal, but it looks like a toad! What do you care, it's not yours. - Who knows? - Well! Hey, young man... this one is leaving immediately! - 40 liters. - 35. It wasn't full when we left. But I filled it up! Too bad for you! Do you think I took the oil? Hey, Farinello... hold on, hold on. - Down! - Why? I can't take this one myself? This little toy is worth 500,000 lire. So? - All right! - Bravo Cesare! Get going! Cesare... the turn signal! There seems to be a bed in here! Where you going? It's the wrong road! Hey, it's the wrong road! This doesn't lead to La Spezia, but back to Acqui. What a discovery! I get it. You're really obsessed! Well, this is when Mr. Egisto will fire both of us! Honest to god! What are you doing? Can't you see it's fog? Steer! Are they crazy? They won't get very far that way! Idiots! Hey! - Are you blind? - What kind of driving is that? Where are your eyes, you cretin? I'll show you where to look! Then we'll settle the score! I think we're stuck here. Here! Look at this! What a mess! - Get the license number! - What number! Get away! You jerk of a jerk! Watch what you say! Never mind, Gigi! We'll get them with a lawyer! I like that! They drive like fools, then they want to be right! They're always right, of course! Hey, down there, you going to stop it or not? - What do you want? - Look at that! What do you have to shout about? You were out of the way and you still want to shout? Look, it's broken! Come here, come here! So then? FARINATA FOR SALE [chick pea pancake] - Look, it got whacked! - Hey! Here he comes, here he comes! Run! I was quick, no? Now let's get out of here! - Anna, want me to help you? - Thanks. Listen to me, don't take it this way. You should come with me to cheer up. I have some really funny friends! Filippo! You should get to know him. Yes, he's a real nut! - What evenings we have! - Girls! I'm going home for a moment, keep an eye on things. - Don't worry. - Hello, I want a strong thread. Tell them, nice girl! A strong thread of this exact color! And fast, I'm in a hurry! - Here! - Tonight we're going dancing! - My daughter will pick up her package later. - Yes, yes, sir! This one! 80 cents. You know... I've decided. Tonight I'll come with you. Finally! It took you so long! Come on, you'll see! We'll have fun! And leave your worries behind! Well, Filippo, what's with you tonight? - Why? - I've told Anna so much about you. I brought her here for a good time and you don't say a word. I don't know why but tonight I'm not in the mood. - All of a sudden you're shy? - Who knows! It can happen to anyone. Especially when you're lucky enough to meet... a woman like you! That's to say you are not satisfied. I'm sorry I've made you lose your humor. Don't worry, lady, there's an easy way to make me find it again. You know how? Dance with me! If it's that, with pleasure! A new method apparently... Tonight he's sentimental... the method changes, but the end is always the same. What do you care? Dance with me! Now I want to tell you very sincerely... Gemma told you that I always joke, but that's not true. You know, I like you a lot! You're cute, young, elegant. - I don't like compliments. - They're not compliments but the truth. I will also say something less nice. I'm sure you're thinking of something else. That's not true. Ah! you seem very preoccupied, distant. No, Filippo, you're wrong. I don't want to hear such talk. I want to have fun! - Please escort me to the bar. - Gladly. Did you see that? - What'll it be? - An anisette. - Two anisettes. Where are you going? I live on the other side. Don't be afraid, I won't kidnap you, at least tonight! Take me home, please! No hurry, it's a beautiful night. We can take a walk. No, it's late. My mother's waiting at home. Too bad for mom! And tomorrow I have get up early and go to the shop. I'll become a regular customer at your shop. We only sell women's things. I'll buy ribbons and lace and give them to you and you'll give me a kiss. - Why did you turn off the engine? - Me? it stopped by itself. - Don't talk nonsense! Start the car. - A kiss would start it up again. - Stop this or I'm getting out! - But you're far from home! All I want is a kiss. Watch it or I'll call someone! That's not necessary. I won't make you if you don't want to! - You're not mad at me? - But no! Then tomorrow evening I can pick you up at the shop? - As you like. Good night. - Good night. - Did you hurt yourself? - Oh! Look! - Nothing broken, though? - What? Don't you see? - Well, if it's only your stocking... - And that's nothing? - Where are you going? To Savona? - Yes. - Do you want to get in? - Thanks. - No problem! - And the bike? - Naturally! We can load it on. - Sorry! - Actually, we're not allowed to carry people in the trucks. What? He told me to climb! Well! Oh... let's go, come on up! Gianni, are we going? Let's go! Hey! Come on, come on! There's only a few miles to Savona. Take it easy on your bicycle when the road is wet! - Yeah! - Yes, but at the first houses of Savona you should get off. - Good morning, Mr. Egisto. - Bad day! - Yeah! Hey guys, look at the great Caesar, the racer! You were quick, huh? You didn't even let the paint dry! Mind your own business, Brillantina! Or one of these days I'll comb your hair my way, got it? Any time, just put two fingers in your mouth and whistle! - Well? What happened? - Huh? - Ah, nothing special. A vegetable truck overturned. They were in the wrong. Oh, a truckload of vegetables! They were in the wrong! This is a job that needs a level head, alright... or else... hundreds and hundreds of thousand-lire notes at stake! No more nonsense! When you guys do some nonsense, the guys in Genoa don't blame you... they blame me! Got it? Me! But did I really make such a bad name for you? In ten years work I made more trips than I have hair, and in some bad trucks. You remember, right? - Have I ever twisted a bolt? - I didn't say that... So? One time I scratch a fender, you start talking about money! What damage have I done, if I may ask? I've earned you a sack of money in ten years of living like a dog... - Me? -Yeah, you and your pals in Genoa, you bet I have! - Hey! - Yes! - And don't come back here, got it? - Fine with me! - Have you gone crazy? - Let me go! Excuse me, Mr Egisto? If I'm not mistaken, our little Cesare just packed up! - Give me the oil! - Say... is it true he had a fight with his wife? You know it! His wife is a respectable woman! If you don't fight with your wife, who will you fight with? - You're weird! - Give me the number 22. Cesare, go see Mr. Egisto. He wants to talk to you. Talk about what? You heard him fire me! No, you said some bad things and he got mad... But he's calmed down now. Come on! Hello? Yes? Hello? Yes, I hear! Tell me! No, no, no, no, I don't have time. What? Ah! it's OK... call a doctor, right? Oh, you're here! Beh, you've thought it over, eh? Yes! Okay, call me later, eh? It was my wife. It's my boy who's not too well. He has these red things, these... But I still have to work! And when there's work to be done, even the wife, house and family don't count! - There's an insurance man outside! - Okay. Tell him to wait! Understand? And they've already phoned me too! And with the delay, you think the La Spezia guys will pay the premium? - Yeah, you're right! - I know I'm right. Now go. Go to Petrolea to load. - What? - Yes, go, go... don't waste time, go! Thank you, Mr. Egisto! And don't worry about my work... now I'm home in Savona... and crazy stuff in my head, I promise... - no more! - Okay, great! But I told them to withhold 50 lire per week til you've paid for everything, eh? Gasoil and a fender! Ah, I don't forget! - Okay, okay. - Okay, but leave the pliers here. - All set! Bye, Mom. - You'll be late again tonight? Not at all! Do you call midnight late? Midnight? And why hasn't Gemma come to get you? Gemma's waiting for me downstairs. Let me go. I don't like this. Going out alone, coming back late! People see you. What about your husband! Don't you think people will tell him? But I told you Gemma is waiting for me downstairs! Bye. And go to bed, OK? Don't do as usual, that I find you waiting! Bye. - Thank you for the flowers. - Oh, it's nothing. - But I don't want any more. - Why? People will talk and my mother is worried. If you have to worry what people will say! - But I'm married. - Yeah, so to speak. So to speak! I have a husband. Yes, you had one, but not any more now. Anyway, I shouldn't accept gifts from you! Why all these scruples? - People might think... - That you are my lover, right? - So what? - But I don't want that because it's not true! But don't you think I've waited long enough? What? - Well, let's get out. We're here. - Where? - My house. - But I'm not going into your house. Why? What's wrong? Please, Filippo, I've told you many times! But don't you think this is a little too much? What do you mean? You're not a kid anymore. You know these things! You wanted to go dancing and I went. You wanted to go to the movies and I went. You let me court you. A man can't be satisfied with this forever! - But I didn't think... - Come on, get smart! Then why are you going out with me? - I thought you were different, Filippo! - I'm a man! And I can't spend my life just adoring a woman! Think. You're alone. Your husband threw you away! - That's not true! I left him. Let me get off! - No, come here. I got carried away. I'm sorry. Where do you want me to bring you? Be nice, take me home! They load... so we can take a load too, right? Now and then! A shot in the morning never hurts! - And you might meet a girl at the bar. - What would you do with her so early? Ask Cesare, he's empty-handed! Look, I'm in no mood for joking this morning! - Don't talk football if you don't know. - I know and I can talk, my friend! This year Genoa will jump to the top of the chart. I'll bet you anything! Only if it played by itself! Mina! Vermouth for everyone! That's a tease! The center forward is a cannon! - The goalie... - He's a cannon! Yes, I can say it loud! The left wing... - He's a cannon! - And you're a bore! The coach, I've known him since I was on the team. He was still a kid but I on the other hand... - You were a great man, huh? - Hey, don't try to be funny! Listen, until half-way through the first round, all home games are easy! Yeah! And what about Bologna? That's one. What else? Even if they lose against Bologna... - How are you, beautiful? - Hello. What an attitude! Even for me? Guys like you, it's better to lose them than find them! That's not at all nice! Can I get you anything? Two anise. - To your health, love! - Stop it! You know I don't like it. What's this? You know him? I saw him once. - Damn, even him? - Stupid! Yeah, I met him on the street. I thought so! Because since his wife left him... How are you? Is your knee better? Yeah, it's not so bad now. I've done several days... of compresses with my leg on a chair. Oh yeah? How come I never see you? You're not staying in Savona? Yes, yes, now, yes! How about that! The friar turns into devil! - Carlo, don't start! - And tell me... Now you're in Savona, you doing anything this Sunday? - Him? What do you expect? He's a hermit! - Carlo, stop! Tell me what you're doing Sunday! Nothing special... working. I told you! He's crossing his hands and doing penance! Why get mad? It's not worth the trouble. Got a cigarette? Gianni... let's go. Where you going? To deliver to La Spezia. - Mina, mark it! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I'm going up to my house. - Hello papa. - Hello Ninetto. - Hello Cesare. Can I come up? - Sure, come on. Dad, I've already eaten. I'll stay with Cesare. But let him eat in peace, eh? See how I spin this wheel! Look out! We're going to run into a wall! You know... if you scratch a fender, you'll hear from Mr. Egisto... - You know, like this! - Yeah? Try it! How? What? No! What are you doing? Wait! No! Ninetto wins by default! Good! Did you pick up my shoes? No. Watch out, that's hot. Why? - Because I have more to think about than your shoes. But it's been more than a week! Leave that alone. Wait, I'll give it to you myself. You men have no idea what it means to run a house. The children. The kitchen. The washing, the ironing, the sewing! And when you're done... here come the customers! Maria, too large here! Maria, too tight here! I get it. The husband should go without shoes! No dear, I don't send my husband away in a mess! You should have married someone else! - Then yes! - Ah, yes! You know who you need? A silly young women who is lazy and full of pretensions. - Come on, come on, finish! - And meanwhile no shoes! I saw Anna all dressed up with a companion... Well, as for me that... That's why he left her! No, not that! She left him. They weren't getting along. But it's Cesare's fault if she... Give me that, I'll cut it! That idiot puts up with... If he's suffering, why not look for her? Because's he's a man, that's why! Great! Meanwhile, this disgrace... Want more soup? - No. Has Cesare said anything? Cesare? You know how he is! He'd rather cut his tongue than say anything! So, you talk to him! No way! And tomorrow I want my shoes! Noon. Come on, let's eat! - Look, Cesare... - Yeah, what's up? A few days ago, Maria... - What did Maria do? - Oh, nothing! It's... that she met Anna. It might not be a bad idea if you... well, my wife thinks you should speak to Anna. I'm going to eat. What are you doing, returning to Acqui? - Yes. OK bye. Give my greetings to your wife, eh? See you Monday. Well? You don't say hello anymore? - Oh, good morning! - Good morning. I was just passing here and I saw you go out. We use the same road, I think. - Oh, I don't know... - Oh no? - I'm going to eat. - Ah, alone? - Yes, alone. But you'll be bored. - When I'm alone I never get bored. - Damn, what a bear! You'd even leave me on the road with my injured knee. But you know, I'm the kind that... - I can't explain it. - No, you explain very well! You live nearby? Yeah, up there on the top floor. Oh, it must be very pretty up there! The view of the sea! And now we must part. - I told you. I'm going to eat. - Me too. I usually go in there. No, that one I don't like. - So, if you like, we'll go here! - Yes. Sit here? Waiter? Is the exam over? Did I pass? But you never laugh! If we become good friends, you'll have to learn to laugh! I like good times. Your order? Pasta, soup, risotto? - Ah, risotto for me! - Me too. Give me two risottos! Nice, this tune! You like to dance? I don't think I have time for dancing. - Waiter? - Coming! - Carlo, you know him well? - Uh, okay. Really you live alone? - Yes, I'm alone now. - And your wife? We didn't get along and we're separated. She stayed at Acqui. It can't be easy to get along with you! - Why? - Because you have a closed nature. You need a woman who's a bit special. Someone who can put a little joy in your life... and give everything without asking too much. Maybe. But that's very difficult. Who knows? We're here. I'm going up to my place for a moment. Coming with me? Since you don't like my company, I was thinking of leaving! No, on the contrary, I like it. - Are you really sincere? - I'm telling you! - And after? - Let's not think about later. You are alone... free, and I'm alone. - Cesare! - You know my name? From the first moment. - And your name is? - Piera. So many boats! You know that as a girl, I wanted to marry a sailor? And basically, you're a sort of sailor. You're like them. They leave, they stay away, they come back. And they have a wife in every port. But there are also sailors who don't have even one. - Well, shall we make a cup of coffee? - Oh, yeah, let me do it! - Or who knows what a mess you'll make! - But no! Come on, don't be a nuisance! What time is it? - Ten o'clock. Why? - Mmm, we're late. I'm going now, or I'll be late. We don't linger together even for a little while. I come back and you leave. It's because of your stupid job! And yours! If you didn't insist on going to the shop... What should I do? Stay home waiting while you're spinning like a top... with your damn truck! Nice job you chose! And I'm tired of repeating the same things! Bye. He's just stupid! - Anna! - Oh, you're here! - Bye, Gemma. - Good evening. - Good evening. When you come get me, do me a favor and wear your good suit! - But if I went home to change I'd be late. - Then don't come. Why are you ashamed of me? - Tomorrow I'm going dancing. - But tomorrow is Sunday. I'm free. - Much better, come with me. - No, you know I don't dance. - So what? Learn how! - Hey, Anna! - What? Want to make a scene in the street? - Anna, don't give me that look! - How else should I look? You know I don't like these visits. Your crazy friends... that wife and those kids! But they're nice people! Today they took Nini out for the first time. Great! So we'll go around like a school class! Great fun! Here he is! - Beautiful Nini! - Nini! Let me see him, let me see. Cute little brat, how nice! Look at his little hands, look! How beautiful! Look at him, look at him! - How beautiful! - Cute. There! I knew it! Nini! You dirty baby! Maria! Maria! Need to change him again! I don't understand what you're laughing at. Poor baby! You didn't expect him to ask permission, did you? But think of when we'll have one of our own! Hmm... wonderful prospect! Hey! Are we already at Savona? No, we're at Acqui. I'll go see my wife for a minute. Get some sleep, I'll be right back. Oh! Good evening! What's up? Didn't expect me, right? No. I knew you were here when I saw the truck. What are you doing, leaving right away? You know what time it is? One! But I told you I wouldn't wait! So when I'm away you come home at this hour? Tell me... you do or don't remember that you're my wife? What are you talking about? I went dancing. I don't want to know where you've been! I'm asking if you're always this late. And what should I do, according to you? You're always away. Should I rot here at home? Not rot! Look after your home! - Like Gianni's wife, for example. - But she has children! Right! You don't want any. Nice example you bring up. Gianni's wife. Poor wretch! She's not even 30, and she looks 40. I'm 20, remember! And that means you can run around at night and do what you like? I have nothing to blame myself for! I work the whole blessed day and I pay for everything I wear. I've told you many times that I wish you'd stay home, not at the shop! Because... because I'm sick of your clothes... I'm sick of your wages, your movies, your airs and your dancing... I'm sick and I have been for a long time, understand? I'm even sicker of your dirty job and your damn truck! - Anna! - Yes sir, I can live fine without you! - Anna! - And a lot better, too! - So you'd better decide. Make up your mind to be a wife, a wife, understand, or there's the door! - Oh yeah? Well, well. - Understand? - I understand. Anna! Anna! Anna! Here you go! What're you thinking of? I'm thinking two people could live here. Time to close, Filippo's here. He's never late by one minute! Great lover! Filippo has never been faithful for more than ten days! - This time, instead... - Please, Gemma. What's wrong? I can't take it anymore. Filippo is already tired? It doesn't look that way! When men are punctual, believe me, they're still in love! But I don't care about Filippo. Oh! it seemed to me that... Nothing happened between us, I swear! - Really? - Really. Quite a miracle! But every day is a struggle. He's like a creditor who expects to be paid. After all, he's not all wrong about that. And I feel so tired, Gemma. So tired and so alone. It ends with you saying yes. - But I don't want to, I have a husband. - So? By now you're alone, like me. I've said no two, three, four, five times, then... - But that's horrible! - You want fun, you have to pay for it, my dear! But I don't love him. - Dump him! Find someone you like more. - No, no one. There will be struggles, tears... and eventually you will do like me... after all. If I found someone to marry me... oh, I swear that afterward... But finding a husband is not easy... It's good luck that touches a few, and even they don't appreciate it. A husband! You had one. True, he didn't understand you... But he loved me. Now you have regret? No... maybe I made a mistake. But I didn't realize what it meant not to have protection. He was a man. My man. That was my home. Why not try to make up with him? By now... Listen Gemma, I'm not coming back here again! - What? You're leaving the shop? - Yes, that guy won't leave me alone. - It's like a nightmare. - If it's about that, I'll talk to him! It's not only about that. My husband didn't want me to work here. - And you think of it now? - Maybe he was right. Let the owner know. And what will you do? I don't know. I'll work at home. Then Maria can help me. - Maria? Gianni's wife? - Yes. - But those people made you nervous! I was wrong, they're good people. Look Gemma, I'll leave by the back door. I don't want Filippo to see me. - Maybe you talk to him. - Leave it to me. - Thanks. So Anna, good luck! - Won't you give me a kiss? - Of course! And forgive me, please. Thanks for everything. This is the marvel of the century! 90 lire to come and touch! From the waist up, a woman - from the waist down, a snake with scales! - Women snakes, you know them well! - Those, I fry them on Fridays! Can you smell it? - Excuse me! - Stop that! - Take a hike! - You having fun? - Yes. Look how little it takes to amuse me. Why, are you bored? In truth, I didn't think it would be so much fun here! I told you that with me you would learn to laugh, right? - Yeah! - Hey, let's shoot the target! - Oh, yes! - Want to take away some of that stuff? - Yes! - Pellet or dart? What should I use to win any prize? - Darts. - Darts, then. - Say, you like that comb? - Yes. Pretend it's already on your head. You want it for your lady? I'll offer it to her if you want. - No, no, thanks. Well, I shot for the bottle of wine. With this game, even when you win you can't get what you want! Thank you! - Hello Piera! Hello Cesare! - Hi. What a beautiful comb! Horn? No, tortoise shell. I did say he'd find the one who'd take him for a ride! Hey... how would you like me to rearrange your face? - Whose, mine? - Yeah, yours! No, no! Cesare, be good! No! Please! You'll pay for this, you know! Whenever you want, idiot! Easy, Cesare... don't get in trouble. We were so merry... Shall we go on the rides? Come on! A clean towel, quick! Right away! May I? Oh, Anna! Come in, come in! What's going on? Pini has a 40-degree fever. The doctor's in there! - You know where the towels are? - No, I don't know. The towel, Gianni? Oh Anna! You give it to me. They're on the top shelf. And a spoon to see in the throat. Give it to me. I regret the children are coming back from school and I have to go to Turin. Go ahead. I'll take care of the children. No, you have to go to the shop. I'm not going to the shop any more. What? And why? It doesn't matter. I'll tell you. Go safely. I'll stay here with Maria. And if she wants, I can even help with her work. You're a very good girl, Anna! Miss Piera? The roast is almost ready. It's been in the oven an hour. - Thank you, Mrs. Evelina. You need me? - No, I'll mind the roast! Okay... tomorrow I'll come ready to learn. I always say that... but I swear I'll be serious tomorrow! Oh, it's him! Leave it, I'll go... Yes, thank you, Mrs. Evelina! - Good evening Mr. Cesare. - Good evening, Mrs. Evelina. - Hello dear, how are you? - Oh! - What was she talking about? - Cooking. She taught me a lot. - I'm becoming a housewife! - Really? Yes! Imagine, I didn't know how to do anything! Mrs. Evelina says this is working because... because I'm in love with you. - Hey, who gave you the roses? - Guess. - The florist. - Oh, you bought them! - Well, I saved on spending! - Ahi, ahi! - Oh, we housewives! - Do you mind? - No, indeed. That means that instead... we'll eat roses! I won't do it anymore. - But dinner isn't ready yet? - Be patient. Mrs. Evelina will serve it soon. My poor love, you're hungry! - When will you get some time off? - Who knows? - But I'm afraid that by now... - I can't wait to have you all to myself - It wouldn't be too much? - It will never be too much! I recall a workmate with a wife who complained of not seeing him enough. Women always complain about the same things. - So you see it's true! - Wait! So my friend took a week off and stayed home from morning til night. You know what happened? He ended up squabbling with his wife. - Why? - Because the closer you are, the more chances you have to argue. Our life is nice just the way it is... Being always out and about, and no time to quarrel when we return! - We'll never quarrel, right? - No. I would like it so much if you were always here beside me! Especially now, when it's so cold at night... in that bed, all alone! - I can't even sleep. - Maybe you don't have enough blankets. But I'll bring you some tomorrow. I'll get them from the house. - At Acqui? - Yes. Oh, dear! - So after all... are we going to eat these roses or not? - Mrs. Evelina? Rosetta, where's the other parapet? Ah, there it is! - Ninetto! Take the train! - Stop it! You're smashing everything! Hush, kids! If Pini wakes up, see what I'll do to you! Cesare! It's time to get up. It's six. Up, lazybones! Oh, look, with your shoes on the bed! Poor blanket! - You're warm enough now, eh? - Yes. Almost as if you were here. Almost. I said almost. Well, let me go wash up, otherwise I'll be late. No, no, wait a moment. You're always in such a hurry to leave. What do you want me to do? And tonight I have an important job. Want me to go with you to the garage? - Just to take a walk together. - No, Piera, it's better not to. You're ashamed to go out with me, right? Why don't you tell the truth? What are you talking about? I'm saying I'm tired of spending my days stuck inside waiting for you... without a single satisfaction! Piera, but you knew that. That's my life... Always running around day and night. Unfortunately the truck is my house. You told me I'm like a sailor. I understand you don't feel at home here! And you seem ashamed of me! You want to eat in places where nobody knows us. What ideas you have in your head! Then what? I did everything to take her place, but all I did was take her place in bed. - Stop talking nonsense! - It's true! You never once had the courage to introduce me as "my wife". Of course! You're not my wife. So what? Many people aren't married, but still act as if they were! And in the end they pass for husband and wife. - But marriage is a different affair. - Yeah, so you say... But you don't have what it takes to be happily married, hmm? Change the subject, eh? Ahh... I understand... You don't care that the one who loves you... stays here alone day and night, waiting for you while you're away... What are you talking about? It doesn't matter because I'm not your wife. I have no other right than to leave the way I came. But who's telling you to leave? Not today! But it's just a matter of time! I can feel it! Oh, sorry if I tell you these things. But I know that I shouldn't fool myself... that I've got to be who I am. Mah! Go, dear... go because you'll be late. Bye dear. Who is it? Miss Piera, I found some squid for tonight that are beautiful and fresh... Oh, Mrs. Evelina, I have some news that's even fresher! I've decided not to learn to cook any more. - Oh! - What eyes you're giving me. That's the way it is. Some things need to grow... And I haven't been born yet. What should I do? It's comical, no? And to think that I believed it. But seriously, you know! Maybe fate wants it this way. Let's not talk about it anymore. I'm going down, ma'am. You take care of here, okay? Goodbye. An anise. - Oh! Who is it? - Guess. Ah! Carlo! But remember, these familiarities are no longer allowed. You know they won't get you anywhere. I know... and I'm sorry because you've become even more beautiful. I can say that, right? But tell me, how come you're out on the loose? - They say he's keeping you locked up. - Oh, that's not true. It's my idea to stay home. Congratulations. Family life. But it must be rather boring. Yeah, in fact I'm boring myself. You know, I'm not made for that life. But when there's love... - How much? - An anise? - No... don't. Bye, Carlo. We'll see each other again, no? It won't be difficult. - Good evening Mr. Egisto. - Good evening. Catch it, ok? Throw it! - Hold it there. - Hold, hold, catch it! Is that you, Maria? - Good day, Anna. - Good day, Gianni. - Papa! - Papa! Good boys, can't you see I'm dirty? Pini! I'm back from Torino, and now I have to go from Savona to Sesto Calende. Pini, what happened to your face? You'll become a driver! - Anna, you take him! - Don't you want to rest? Breakfast is ready! No time to rest! I'll have a bite, then go quick! Dear Pini, good... You're right, Gianni! Pini is a real driver! Right? I'll have to raise prices for new soles...of course! But I can't raise the rent! Does that seem right? But you have a surplus with Mr. Cesare, because now there are two there instead of one. This has nothing to do with the rent! Two, eh? Would you like to say three? - Good evening Mr. Carletto! - Good evening. Have you noticed? Every day for a week now... I don't want to judge... but since it's Mr. Cesare who pays... So starting today, you pair up with Cesare, eh? Oh... and why? Come on, we understand each other... and Rico is paired with Gianni. So you're all set. As you like, Mr. Egisto. but I don't understand. All set! And we'll put an end to certain stories... that are not very savory. As for me, going with Cesare, Rico or Gianni... it's all the same. Good! Now beat it because there's nothing else to say! My respects! Ah! Hello? Did you talk to Mrs. Evelina about the house? No, not yet. Great... so at the last minute when we leave here, we won't know where to go! I'll stop by tomorrow. Don't worry about it! - So now I'm paired with Carlo. - I know. How do you know? You know, around here everyone knows everything! No, leave it, I'll go! Hey Cesare, good evening. Good evening. Come on, come on in. What is it? Well, since we have to pair up... I thought I'd pick you up. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Do you want to sit for a moment? - No, not necessary, thanks. How are you? Mah! So-so. We decided to change houses. This one's so small. What time is it? Five o'clock. Let's go! Goodbye. - Good evening, Mr. Cesare! - Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Carletto! - Good evening. Anna, what's the matter? - Are you crying? - You knew. Why did you tell me nothing? But who told you? Doesn't matter... but now it's really over. What do you mean over? You know how men are. It's just another thing. No, no, it's over. And I can't stay here any more, you know? Every time I see your husband return... I think he's going home too... down there in Savona, to that woman. You're right, but don't give up hope! - You'll see that Cesare... - No, it's really over. - No... Cesare did it to annoy you... - No. - You know men's pride! - There's nothing left to do! Hey, damn you! Brake, Cesare! Brake, Cesare! What's the matter? Have you gone crazy? Brake, Cesare! Why don't you say something? Speak! How many times were you at my house? Me at your house? I've never been there. - How many times? - Never, I swear! - Don't swear! - No, Cesare! - Don't swear! Don't swear! - Let go, Cesare! - How many? - Piera and I are just friends! - How many times? - But I tell you! Never! - How many? - Yes, once! - Coward! - Watch out, Cesare! Cesare... Cesare, I promise that between me and Piera... there is nothing... we're good friends... we've known each other for so many years... If you have have the idea... It's your jealousy even with your wife! - Leave my wife out of this! Wait for me at Pinotto's. I'll be right back. A grappa. Cesare, what are you doing? Nothing. I saw you arrive... and I thought that... Cesare? How are things at the shop? I don't go to the shop any more. I work at home with Maria. Gianni didn't tell you? No. Are you cold? I'll make you some fire. I need to go because it's late. There's a lot of dust there. Put the coat in the closet. Yes, Cesare. Wait! Outside it's very cold. Tomorrow morning I'll be home early. Okay. I'll wait. Shall we go? Look, Cesare... I want to explain. Forget it. It's old stuff. Let's hurry rather, Anna is waiting. - Anna? - Yes, Anna! Come on, let's go! Carlo, you didn't fully close the door. THE END Subtitles by filmnutz edam17 @ KG September, 2012 - Kay. - Anna. How are you, darling? Gee, it's good to see you. And you too, Kay. - Where's Phillips? - He's gone to the movies. - They're giving away an automobile. - With tires? It was nice of you to let me in. How did you know I was at the front door? - I heard the bell. - But I didn't ring it. Didn't you? Well, then, I guess it was my imagination. - Let me have your coat. - Thanks. - Where's Dad? - He's - He's gone to the village... on an errand with Dr. Haggard and Dunning. - On a night like this? - Would you care for something to warm you up? Well, I was on the wagon, but I think I'll step off and give my seat to a gentleman. Make it a weak one. Listen to that wind howl. Boy, it's got my goose pimples popping overtime. It's a perfect night for a nice, juicy murder. - What's this about murder? - Hi, Dad. Hello, Doc. How are you, Dunning? How are the three musketeers? Where the devil did you come frrom? Dad, that's no way to greet your prodigal daughter. I thought you were supposed to be staying with your aunt in Washington. Well, I - I was, but, uh, when I read about... all the trouble you're having with that mean old Senate investigating committee... I thought I'd better come home and see if I couldn't help. All right. What's the catch? Isn't it funny? Dad always thinks there's a catch to everything. Come on. Out with it. What is it? Well, all right. Now watch your blood pressure. - I'm, uh, engaged. - Engaged. What, again? Well, I'm not engaged exactly. You see, I'm more than engaged really. Now how can you be more than engaged? - Well, I'm married. - Oh, well, make up your mind. - What-Which is it? - I'm married. - Why, Kay, darling, that's wonderful. - Married. As if I didn't have enough trouble. - Well, what's this idiot's name? - Roger. Roger Blake. Dunning, get my lawyer. Dad, don't be silly. You can't sue a man just because he married me. He may have married you, but it's my money he's after. Oh. Give me that. I suppose a man wouldn't marry me unless I had money? Not the last six no-account nincompoops you've been engaged to. Well, Roger's different. He works. - For the government. - Dudley, why don't you at least meet Kay's husband? - See for yourself what he's like. - Why should I? Perhaps you'd like to give them a honeymoon. To South America. Maybe I will. All right, Kay. Trot him out. Where is he? Well, I-I made him stay in Washington. I thought tomorrow he'd drive up, and you could meet him then. At least I'll have the pleasure of insulting him personally. You're an angel with a shining halo. Thanks a million. That's probably just about what it's going to cost me. I know you'll like him. I'm going up and call him right away. - Well, good night, everybody. - Good night, Kay. - It's good to have you home again, Kay. - It's good to be home, Anna. And if anyone ever tries to tell me about how mean stepmothers are... I'll just tell them that I know better. - Good night, Anna. - Good night. My daughter is to know absolutely nothing of what happened in this house tonight. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir. you got any pigs around here? Nitrous oxide. Sookie, sookie. Me first. You take it easy, now. There's enough for everybody. - Right. - OK, go for it. Wow! Come on. Let's go! Okey-dokey. Listen, that doesn't smell like laughing gas. - Ah, this is special laughing gas. - What is that shit? What is it? Oh... With this stuff, you smell it and we do the laughing. 'All we have to do is give to be happy.' Well, you're up bright and early today. I'm getting used to life on the farm, I guess. And you? Well, today's my day for planting alfalfa. How would you like it if someday I taught you the ancient art of meat-smoking? I'd be honored. Well, don't be too sure about that. Sometimes folks don't have a stomach for it. Well, don't worry about me. Mine's cast-iron. That's a good start. It's beautiful. Well... see you later, honey. OK. What are you doing in here, girl? You know what Vincent would do if he caught you? - I shudder to think of it. - I'm sorry! I was just curious. The door was open, and Vincent said he was gonna teach me how to smoke meats. Oh... he did? Yeah. This morning. Oh... Oh, well, I see. That's... that's different then. I just want to be helpful to you, Ida. Of course, you'll be able to help out a lot. That'll be nice. What a day for tubing'. Tubin'? Yeah, tubing', my precious one. Haven't you ever... tubed? I'm not a very strong swimmer. Oh, you don't have to be. That's the beauty of it. I don't know how to swim at all. - Are you sure? - All right... One, two, three... Woo! He)', hey, hey, hey! (Tube deflates) Ida, what's that noise? My tube is leaking. Hang on! Hang on! I'll come and help you. I... I can't swim. Here.

Sing-A-Long Subtitles By MightyMike77020 A place. Where nobody dared to go. The love that we came to know. They call it Xanadu. It takes your breath and it'll leave you blind. And now. Open your eyes and see. What we have made is real. We are in Xanadu. A dream of it we offer you. A million lights are dancing. And there you are a shooting star. An everlasting love. And you're here with me eternally. Xanadu. Xanadu. Now we are here - In Xanadu. Xanadu. Xanadu. Xanadu. Now we are here - In Xanadu. Xanadu, Xanadu. Now that I'm here Now that you're near. In Xanadu. Now that I'm here Now that you're near. In Xanadu (PLAYING CLARINET) What the hell? Guys like me shouldn't dream anyway. (I'M ALIVE PLAYING) I'm alive And the world shines for me today I'm alive Suddenly I am here today Seems like forever And a day Thought I could never Feel this way ls this really me? I'm alive And the dawn breaks across the sky I'm alive And the sun rises up so high Lost in another world Far away Never another word Till today But what can I say? I'm alive Suddenly came the dawn From the night Suddenly I was born Into light How can it be real? I'm alive I'm alive And the world shines for me today I'm alive Suddenly I am here today Seems like forever And a day Thought I could never Feel this way ls this really me? I'm alive I'm alive What the... Hey, Sonny. Never thought we'd see you back here again. Yeah. Well, I'm not exactly thrilled about it. Yeah. You said this place made you crazy. I decided I'd rather be crazy than hungry. "The calculation is sensitive to the time you plan to own your house. "The factor increases if you pay off your mortgage in five years." JO: Five years? He'd be lucky if he paid off the movers. Who could pay off a house in only five years? Hey, rock stars don't even need that long. They pay cash. "A million dollars, man? See my manager. I'm busy, you know." Last one in, first one home. SANDRA: Hey, it's Sonny. JO: It's Michelangelo Malone. Michelangelo, glad you're here. The ceiling needs painting. Uh-huh, all right, that's enough. Well, the great Sonny Malone returns to AirFlo Records, welcomed by cheering throngs of thousands. Art world fails to suffer. News at 11:00. Cut it out. You know I wouldn't come back to all this unless I had to. You know, we were all really pulling for you. Yeah, you know, like one of us breaking away. Going out on his own. Really doing it. Yeah, no paint by numbers, no assembly line art. So what happened? It's what didn't happen. No bread. I fought it, that's for sure. Don't worry. I spend my whole life painting what other people want. I paint his van. I paint somebody else's mural. I paint Simpson's album covers. Then when I finally quit to freelance, not only do I almost starve to death, but I can't figure out what I wanna do. Well, you can try it again. You will, won't you? (EXCLAIMING) Look who decided to drop in. Where's your white flag? You have a way with words, Simpson. You know that? Same old wise-ass attitude. I thought we discussed this on the phone when I decided to take you back. We did. But I have one question. Why the hell did you take me back? Simple. You're good, and you're the fastest painter around. But this time no more artsy-craftsy Sonny Malone touches, huh? Just enlarge the album cover the way I give it to you. Am I coming in loud and clear? Yeah. Good. Here. You're on your way to your next masterpiece. Get started. That's great, isn't it? Picasso only gets to be called a genius. I get to be called the fastest painter around. Hey, Sonny, I have this terrific friend. You interested? Not right now. Hey. RICHIE: Mmm, she's great looking. I think that's this crazy girl I just ran into. Yeah? I was walking through the park. She nearly ran over me, then she kissed me. Okay, now, let's hear the X-rated version. What did you do? Nothing. She took off. She took off? Come on! Is this the same Sonny Malone that drives women crazy? I'm gonna go find out who she is. You mean right now? Hey, you're definitely gonna be a successful artist, Malone. You know why? Because you're nuts! SANDRA: Simpson's gonna kill him. Listen, Sonny, I told you. I don't know who she is. She never filed a W-2 and she never got a check. And if I never paid her, she just doesn't exist. What do you mean, she doesn't exist? I'm looking right at her. She's on the Nine Sisters album. Not if I didn't pay her, she isn't! PHOTOGRAPHER: Down here at me. Now look to your right. Yeah, that's good. Listen, Sonny, I don't know who she is. How can you not know who she is? You took the picture. Listen, this sounds strange, but there wasn't supposed to be a model on this cover. I snapped maybe 100 shots. In one of them, this girl just jumped into frame. The next time I saw her was on the contact sheets. I liked it, so I used it. That's the whole story. She just appeared? No, no, appeared then disappeared. Now, don't you go spreading this around. This is one of my best covers. Why do you want to know who she is, anyway? I like her. Hey, Lou. You seen her around here? No. Pretty. Hey, you're single, right? Let me show you my daughters. That's great, Lou. I'm gonna go look where I saw her this morning. MAN: Come on, get your balloons. (WOMAN LAUGHING) MAN: Seventy-five cents. MAN 2: I'll meet you later. MAN 3: All right. MAN: Come on, come on over here. Hi. Hi. I'll take one, please. There you go. See you. MAN 4: All right, come on now. (WAVES CRASHING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (CLARINET PLAYING) Hey, mister. What are you doing up there? Hope you don't mind a little noontime music, kid. A little lunchtime serenade? I don't mind. It's kind of nice. But I was just wondering where they laid out the body. I mean, you got something a little more upbeat? Sure. Better? (CHUCKLING) At least it's faster. (LAUGHING) Here, give me a hand, kid. Sure. Boy, oh, boy, they sure don't make rocks like they used to. Want some popcorn? Yeah, thanks. You work around here, kid? Pretty near. I'm over at AirFlo Records. You in the music business? What are you? Are you a record producer? A sound engineer? No. I'm sort of a painter. You, you paint at a record business? Well, not exactly paint. What I do is, I duplicate record covers. But why? I make album covers bigger so you can hang them outside record stores. Promotion. Sounds like an interesting job, huh? Yeah. Sounds like you should take real long lunch hours. You got it. You know, I used to be in the music business, but now I'm what you might call retired. It's a refined name for "bum." SONNY: I don't believe it. Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Hey, kid. Hey, wait up! Where are you going? Hey, you! Come on! Hold on! Oh, hi. Listen, I gotta borrow this. I'll bring it back. Sure. If you bring it back in person. You got it. (CHUCKLING) Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Where are you going? MAN: Get that bike off the pier! (SCREAMING) Oh, shit! Whoo! You're a real Errol Flynn, kid. What other stunts do you do? Man, this whole thing is screwing me up. What whole thing? Ah, nothing. Come on, have a cup of coffee. Sometimes the best person to tell something to is a stranger. Go on. What's on your mind? Okay. I run into this girl this morning. Never saw her before in my life. She kisses me and disappears. So what's so weird about that? What's so weird about that is that 10 minutes later I see her picture on an album cover I'm supposed to paint. I mean, that's crazy, right? Well, if I said it sounded crazy, would you stop looking for her? No. Then why ask? So I'll keep looking for her. Okay, kid, but take a tip from me. What's that? Don't look underwater anymore. Thanks a lot. Hey, Al, where you going? Hey, Sonny. It's good to see you, man. How you doing, Big Al? How could I go wrong with the great paint job you did on my van? Hey, and the chicks love it. Yeah. It's one of the finer examples of my work. It's beautiful, man. Where you headed? East. Where you going? West. Hang on. I'll give you a ride. No, that's cool. Forget it. I owe you one. All right. Okay, hit it. AL: Relax and enjoy it, man. We're taking the scenic route. SONNY: Yeah, just don't forget I'm back here. SONNY: Hey, that's the place on the album cover! Slow down, I wanna get off here. AL: Here? Thanks for the ride. AL: Anytime, Sonny. (WOMAN SINGING) I've always been in your mind You know I will be kind I'll be guiding you Building your dream Has to start now There's no other road to take You won't make a mistake I'll be guiding you Wow. We have to believe we are magic Nothing can stand in our way You have to believe we are magic Don't let your aim ever stray And if all your hopes survive Destiny will arrive Bring all your dreams alive For you Bring all your dreams alive For you You. Me. Hey, I've been asking about you all day. You may not believe this, but I'm painting an album cover and you're on it. Why shouldn't I believe it? Because before today, I never laid eyes on you. Now I've seen you three times in one day. That's a little too coincidental. Sounds like you don't believe it. Well, with all that's happened to me today, to tell you the truth, I don't believe it. You're right. It's too coincidental. Someone must be setting us up. What do you mean? Hey, wait a minute! I didn't have anything to do with this! Really? Yeah, really, I didn't. Hey! (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) Who said I was talking about you? You come here often? Yes. I can practice my skating and no one bothers me. You must live around here then. Sometimes. Say, you think we could... See each other again? Yeah. Would you like that? Why? I don't know. I don't have a very good reason. I'd just like to see you again. Where are you? I don't know where I'm supposed to look. Bring all your dreams alive For you We'll see each other again. Bye, Sonny. How'd you know my name? Hey, wait a minute! I don't know your name. Kira. Kira. I was in big trouble. So what did you do about it? Nothing. Hi, Sonny. What are you doing here? It's early. Yeah, it's really early. I'm working. Well, that's wonderful. RICHIE: Oh, hello there. Why, do you know you bear a strong resemblance to a fellow by the name of Sonny? Oh, yeah. He works here. Always comes in late, though. Say, that's pretty damn good. SIMPSON: It is. It's too good. That's what's wrong with it. It is supposed to look exactly like the album cover I gave you. Is that too difficult? If you want me to work, I'll work. If you want to stand there and argue, I can get into that, too. Don't be a wise ass, Malone. That painting should be done. What are you wasting all this time on the girl for? Because that's how she really looks. I don't give a damn how she really looks. Just get it finished. Now, when are you gonna have it done? Well, I'd say it probably will be done when it's done. But that's only an approximate guess. Five minutes, my office. If it's six, keep walking. (DOOR SLAMMING) Sonny, what did you do? Nobody likes it, but we all say yes and then forget it. It goes with the job. Four minutes. What difference does it make? I'll say it's Tuesday, he'll say it's Wednesday. So, big deal. Tell him it's Wednesday. What does it cost? Oh, nothing. Maybe just the truth. Just go in there and agree with him. That's all he wants. You want me to say that Tuesday's Wednesday, right? Everyday of the week. Three and a half minutes. All right! I'll be right back. Sit down. (CHUCKLING) You think you're pretty special around here, don't you? No. I never said I was special. Well, you're not. I mean, you didn't discover art, you know. Who do you think did that? I did. Surprises you, doesn't it? No, not really. Now, I've got an office, I make a lot of money, and people respond when I call. That's because I smartened up and I gave up art. I think you made the right decision. I want you to smarten up, too. Start doing things the company way, not the way you want to do them. But sometimes I see more in these covers than what's really there. That's art. Just paint what you're told to paint. If you start making changes, then other people start making changes. And before you know it, you got a lot of people running around, doing what they want to do. That's not a company. That's chaos. Now, I want you to hang some of your precious covers. Pick up the van and hustle your butt over to the Platinum Palace. Tuesday's Wednesday. Hey, clarinet. How you doing? Hey, what do you say, kid. What're you doing up there? Trying to get down. Grab a hold of the ladder. Sure. Hey, if we keep meeting like this, we might as well introduce ourselves. Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire. Malone and McGuire. Sounds like a vaudeville team. What you got there? Oh, this is a real gem. I've been waiting months for it. Ah, Glenn Miller. You wouldn't know about him. He was before your time. So was Beethoven, but I know who he is. Do you like Glenn Miller? Do you like rock and roll? I love rock and roll. I love Glenn Miller. (WHISTLES) This place is incredible. It belonged to a silent movie star. (CHUCKLES) Obviously, they did things big in those days. What do you do with all this space? Nothing really. But I love this room because it makes my records sound great. Well, I've only got one thing to say. Remember, I gave you some popcorn. (LAUGHING) Okay. But you came here to listen to Glenn Miller. So, all set up. There he goes. Nothing like that sound, huh? That sound was a miracle. Hey, Danny, that's you. Yeah. Hey, this girl... Danny, there's this girl... Listen. (PLAYING CLARINET) That's me. Hey, that's all right. You got any more surprises? This is what I call my memorabilia room. Sort of the story of Danny McGuire. Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman. You really knew those guys? Yeah. We used to all hang out together. After I toured with Miller, I got my own band and my own club on West 51 st Street. It was small and jam-packed, but everybody who was in town would drop by. Sometimes they'd sit in for a set or two. Well, now it's a parking lot. Why did you give it up? Oh, it was one of those turning points where you turn in the wrong direction. It was a girl. The girl on the album. Yeah. The singer with the band. When she left, I figured she'd be back, and I wasn't about to run after her, right? (CHUCKLES) Boy, did I teach her a lesson. Never saw her again. After that, the heart went out of my music. I went into the family construction business and became what they call comfortable. Three cheers for comfort. You ever think about going back into music? No. Only about 20 or 30 times a day. (LAUGHS) So, you gonna do it? Well, I can't play clarinet like I did in the old days. But you know something, kid? I'd love to open up another joint again. Why don't you? I've had real estate agents looking for two years. They can't find the right place. Well, if it's just a place you want, that seems pretty easy. No, it's not easy. It's kind of like falling in love. You gotta feel a special attachment, a special... Like you and your friend... Kira. Kira. Hey, why don't you help me look? Maybe you can come up with something. Me? Sure. You've got a good eye. Stranger things have happened. Yeah, I guess they have. (CHUCKLES) Listen, I gotta go. I understand. I'll let myself out? Sure. So long. See you around. (DOOR CLOSING) Now how'd that kid figure out about us? WOMAN: You made me feel so bad I guess it still shows on me. You made me sigh for you I didn't wanna tell you You're getting old, boy. I'm getting old, babe. You wouldn't even know me now. Yes, I do But I'd know you. You know I do Give me, give me... Yes, I'd certainly know you. You know you've got the kind of kisses But I remember... everything. That I'd die for Oh! How I remember. You made me Love you (MUSIC PLAYING) No other face could take you off my mind You're so refined You're much too kind I have to warn you I'm never gonna set you free 'Cause I was born to Love you for eternity BOTH: Whenever you're away from me Wherever you go You're never far away from me I want you to know I only have to close my eyes dear And suddenly I'm where you are You better never stray 'Cause I'll never be far away On every breeze I seem to hear your name My heart's aflame I feel the same I'd fall apart dear If you'd let the feeling end Don't break a heart dear Nobody else could mend Whenever you're away from me Wherever you go You're never far away from me I want you to know I only have to close my eyes dear And suddenly I'm where you are You better never stray 'Cause want to develop something for me to star in.  - johnny, that's amazing. - yeah.

Oh yeah, i'm trying to break the guinness record For most miles in 24 hours. what's it to you? Wow, i didn't really think you'd show. - i didn't come for work. - what did you come for? I came to tell you to go fuck yourself. - watch it, lloyd. - don't tell me what to do. And don't you dare let yourself be convinced That i betrayed you. You abused me. and you won't ever again. But i will work myself to the bone So that someday i will be in a position to abuse you. You're not so smart. how could you be If you actually believed i would ever work for you again? So you wouldn't work for me if you were an agent? Oh, you think i'll fall for this? - and then you'll laugh in my face. - i'm serious, lloyd. You just showed me balls i didn't know you had. So that speech made you believe i should be an agent? I believed it before you got here. Terrance apologized to me. I... I'm sorry, lloyd. I still think you're fucking with me. Go check your office. It's supposed to say agent. ( applauding ) Oh. All right. Get off. Vince: wow, turtle's gonna meet us in italy. - drama: what happened with jamie? - he didn't say. What, is damon coming?

Listen, i just had a really disturbing phone call With the foundation. it's been a week. I'm in haiti at the moment. i understand your check has not come. It has not come, vince. don't you fucking push me, vince. Don't push me. send the check. You do what's right, vince. You gave me your word. you gave lebron your word. Let me tell you something, man. i never even thought you were a fucking good actor. I thought you were terrible. everything i-- "aquaman," "queens boulevard"-- they stink. They fucking stink. I can't even believe that you have money to give to a foundation. But the fact is that you do And you gave me your word that you would. So give me the fucking check, vince! I can't believe i have a fucking academy award And i am calling you back Again and again and again, you cocksucker! Send me the check! ( sobbing ) Hey, vince. it's matt. I'm sorry. i'm sorry, buddy. Um, that was really out of line. And, um, i didn't mean that. I'm just-- i'm just-- I'm just a little tired, man. And, uh, i'm sorry. You guys were right. I feel like a new man. Tell us about it. - I don't kiss and tell. - Come on, give us something. Like what? - Like, was she a squirter? - You are disgusting. - What's up, guys? - He's disgusting. - Turtle got laid last night. - By the co-ed. - Really? - Is it that unbelievable? - No, I just thought Jamie... - He's over her. Guy got back on the horse and performed like a man. - I'm impressed. - How are things going with you? Sloan agreed to have lunch with me. - Where E will perform like a woman. - Shut up! - What are you gonna say? - I want to get back together. Said that before, haven't you? - You don't think it'll work? - No. I don't really want relationship advice from you, Drama. I'm not really giving you relationship advice, cos you and Sloan don't really have a relationship. But embrace it, because freedom is a beautiful thing. - Now we all have it. - Well, I don't want it. I didn't want it either. It was forced upon me. You guys are pathetic. I'm leaving for Italy tomorrow. Is anyone coming with? - I don't know. - Maybe. Free Johnny is! - You really gonna quit acting, Drama? - Freedom, baby. - I might even have some T-shirts made up. - He's just taking a little break. Oh! Miss UCLA. You go, girl! - Hey. - Hey. This may be a little direct, but I feel insecure that you didn't try and kiss me last night. - I didn't want to be aggressive. - I like aggressive. I can see that. - Come over. - Now? Yeah, unless you're busy. No, I'm not busy. It's just... - Jamie? - Yeah. I will help you get over Jamie, Turtle. - You think? - I know. Even if we just talk. All right. I'm just saying, no amount of Ivy gimlets is gonna make Sloan fall back in love with you. - Later, boys. - Later! Look, E, I agree with Johnny. What's a lunch going to accomplish? - I'm gonna make it special. - How are you gonna make lunch special? - I got some ideas. - You're gonna need some roofies, bro. What are we here to talk about? Well, this is extremely secretive. Everything in here is. I'm buying a very big company. - Oh! Congrats. - Which he said wouldn't cost us anything. This deal will make me the head of the largest agency in the entire entertainment business. - You said it wouldn't cost us anything. - I didn't think it would. - He said the company was gonna buy it. - I thought the company could. But it's been a rough year so we're a little strapped for cash. The bank has asked me to personally guarantee something. $12 million. It's great that you two have such open communication about your money. It's not our money. It's her money. I just put up my money when we started this new agency. That was over two years ago, and we still haven't got all that money back. - That doesn't concern you, Ari? - No. - We'll make it back 50 times on this one. - You don't see it this way? Even if I did, I don't see this as just about business. - Is it about ego, Ari? - I've always dreamed about ruling the world, but now I'm getting older I would settle for ruling Hollywood. It goes deeper than that. He's got enemies at this company he wants to buy. - I have enemies everywhere. - Who are these enemies? These are very personal conflicts. He wants payback. - I'm not sure he's thinking clearly. - What? - Tell me about these conflicts, Ari. - They don't matter. Your wife seems to think they do. My wife doesn't know how I do my business. But you need her money in order to buy this business that you want. - So why do you want it? - For revenge. - For a music department. - For Terrance. For a book department that I can pair with filmmakers. - And for Lloyd. - For sports stars. Is it possible these people are the reason you want to buy the agency? Yes, he wants to destroy them. Tell her. - Tell her. - Is it true? - Do you want to destroy these people, Ari? - OK, yes! If I could gouge out Terrance McQuewick's eyeballs and eat them for what he did to me, I would. And I would sell that Benedict Arnold Adam Davies into white slavery if we lived in a place that had a market for it. And Lloyd, that little queen, who I welcomed into my home and allowed to play with my children and care for my dog, and who left me for those two scumbags, I would tie him up and allow the entire Screen Actors Guild to anally rape him if not for the fact that I know he would enjoy it. I hate 'em all. And yes, I want to see them destroyed. But that is not why I want this company. I want... No, I need this company because it's good business. It's good goddamn business. And if I don't buy it, someone else will and that will be very, very bad for my business. And my wife, of all people, should know that when it comes to business, my judgment is never clouded. So please, please, support me like you always have and I will deliver for us like I always have. What do you think? - I think it was a good speech. - Yeah. - Do what you need to do, Ari. - Really? I love you. Can we fuck in here? Johnny, Melrose Place will not stop calling me. They like you. Like Sally Field, they really, really like you. I'm sorry you have to deal with that, but I told you, I'm passing. Just go in and read for them. Ten minutes of your life. What do you have to lose? What's left of my soul, Lloyd. Sorry, gotta go. Maybe you should just test. If you get it, you can turn it down if you really don't want it. I don't want it. Really. Look at me. - Vince, I have one pair left. - Oh, awesome. Thanks. - Vince, what's up? - Hey, Matty. How's it going? - How you doing, buddy? - Good to see you. - Hey, Matt! - Hey. Johnny! Did you get the stuff I sent over to Ari? It's the foundation I'm working with, the One By One Foundation, the kids' foundation. It's at the house. I haven't had a chance to look at it. - You haven't looked at it yet? - No, I've been busy. - With what? - I'm doing the new Darabont movie. - Don't be afraid to get involved, Vince. - I'm not. We're raising money for children all over the world. It's for kids. - It sounds good. - It is good. You should look at it. - I will. - You can look at it too. Yeah, I will, Matt. - I'll see you, man. It's for kids. - See you later. He's intense. - Where are we going? - It's a surprise. - How far is it? - It's a surprise. - I have to be back by 2:30. - You're not gonna be, so surprise. - No, I'm serious. - Me too. Come on, Eric. No fooling around. I have something I have to do. - Really? - Yeah. That's my fault. I wasn't thinking. But this is really important. - What is? - I can't tell you till we're there. - Come on! What is it? - I can't tell you till we're there. Anyway, you can change your appointment. - Is this really important? - Yes, it is. OK. - Thank you. - You owe me. Always. - Wake up. - I'm up. - You're like kissing a corpse. - I'm sorry. You're not attracted to me? Are you kidding? You're smokin'. - Yeah? - Yeah. Maybe you just need to loosen up a little. Relax. - Now you're getting somewhere. - Yeah? You like that? You like that? Yeah. I can't believe I can't get you to stop thinking about her. I'm sorry. She hasn't called me back in three days. Maybe she doesn't want to talk to you. No, I think she's pissed I didn't try to stop her from going. - Or that I didn't go with her, you know? - I don't know her, Turtle. - I should have gone with her. - Well, maybe you should go now. I'm really sorry. I'll live. Yeah, but I got you all worked up and now I'm just abandoning you. That's not fair. You want me to go down on you or something? - Lloyd. Lloyd. - Yes? Ari Gold's on his way up here again. What? Why is this happening? Why does Ari Gold keep coming up here? Adam, I gave up my life to work with you. You two make a cute couple. Adam, talk to me, please. - I think we're merging or Ari's buying us. - Oh my God! What will that mean for me? I know what it'll mean for me. - You know what I'm looking forward to? - No, what's that? Walking through this place Terminator-style - and eradicating all the dead weight. - Unlike you, I have a soft heart. Soft as a diamond. OK, can we dispense with the pleasantries? My business hasn't done too badly over the years. But it could be doing so much better. It will be doing better once we're done here, so let's move on. You were always so certain you knew better than I. Barbara's right, seeing is believing, but when I trim the fat off this shithole and put it all under the Miller Gold banner, you will see what it could have been if you would have kept me around. Oh! I look forward to that. Except, of course, it won't be under the Miller Gold banner. I don't follow. You obviously haven't read the addendum in the contract. What addendum? It was added this morning. It's nothing really. It's just I want assurances that the 40-year-old Terrance McQuewick Agency, which I founded, doesn't somehow lose its name. - That's not really for you to decide. - The addendum says it is. Are you joking? We've only had our name for two years. - How attached to it can you be? - I like Gold, OK? You can't pull this shit last second. I wouldn't have thought I needed it. My lawyers didn't think I did. They said, "What idiot would want to get rid of a brand name "that is synonymous with entertainment "and has been for nearly four decades?" But I woke up in a terrible sweat last night, and I thought, "My God! I know what idiot would want that - him!" - You got your price, you have no other say! - Ari... - I'm out of here! - Come on, Ari. Don't let your unchecked ego bring you to your knees again. Ari, come back and sign the fucking papers! Lloyd Lee, you got a new lease on life. You too, scumbag. - Lloyd. Lloyd. - Yeah, Johnny? I said, it doesn't matter because it isn't about the money. Tell 'em I said, "Thank you, but no thank you." - OK. - All right, I'll talk to you later. OK. What happened? They're willing to push my quote ten Gs. You're making 'em want you. What are you thinking? I'm thinking about you and me scouring the Italian countryside. I can't think of anything better. You know I'm gonna be working most of the time? - You've still got to eat and blow off steam. - True. I just want to make sure you're OK. - I don't want you to have regrets. - I'm great, bro. Really. I might even take up as a cobbler, like Daniel Day. Now that would be interesting. - Ciao. Chase residence. - Hey, it's Matt Damon. Hey, Matt, it's Johnny. What can I do for you? You can write a big cheque to the One By One Foundation. I'd love to, but my future's uncertain right now. I'm out of the business. - Were you in the business? - I was on a hit show for three years. - What happened, they fired you? - No, I left by choice. Listen, John, there are millions of helpless children with much bigger problems. - Well, yeah, of course. - Is Vince there? - Did he look at the materials yet? - Hang on. It's Damon. He wants to know about that charity thing. He must have slipped out, but I can see the brochures opened up here on the table. Put him on the fucking phone, John. OK. Sorry, he Jason Bourned me. Hey, Matt! I was just looking over the stuff. - Pretty moving shit, isn't it? - Very. OK, so can I count on you? - Just let me know what I can do and... - I'll tell you what you can do. We got some trips coming up to Cleveland, Ohio. Feeding America, one of our partners, is running a food bank there. I need another celebrity to go with me to draw attention to the fact that one out of six American children... one out of six, are food insecure. Do you know what that means? They don't know where their next meal is coming from. One out of six Americans. It's fucking shameful. Yeah... I'm leaving for Italy tomorrow. Fuck the American kids. Let 'em starve. Have a good time on your vacation. No, it's not a vacation. I'm working. - Get off your arse, Vince. - That's Bono, Vince. Oh! Hey, Bono. You know, it doesn't take much to have a big effect here, Vince. - Yeah. - I'll tell you what... When you're done with your Frank Darabont movie, I'm gonna take you on a trip, OK? - Yeah, for sure. - In the near term I would like a cheque. - OK. For how much? - Do what's right, Vince. - Don't be a cheapskate. - Do it today. Don't make me wait. I'm going to be waiting. - We'll both be waiting. - See you, Vince. Yo! What's up? - I'm going to New Zealand. - What happened with the co-ed? Nothing. Not today or last night. - You lied? - Sorry. I love Jamie. I don't want to be with anybody else. I got a 6pm flight. Well... I guess freedom is ours and ours alone, Johnny. Yeah. What's wrong? I may have been lying to myself too, bro. I'm an actor. I gotta get to that meeting. We got lucky today. Basically perfect weather. Yeah. God! It feels like forever since we were last here. - It was only a couple of years ago. - More like three. We spent two nights at Shutters. That was a good weekend. It was for me. You got so sunburned you couldn't breathe without pain. Maybe I glorified it a little bit. No, it was amazing. So what are we doing here? Is Vince thinking about buying this place or something? - No. - So what, then? I just wanted to remind you how good we could be together. - You've gotta be kidding me. - Sloan... - I cancelled on someone. - Was it really that important? It's the guy I'm seeing, and yes, I like him. Well, I still love you. - I want to go home. - Sloan. Eric, we've been over this. I want to go home now. Hey, Jame, it's me. I just wanted to let you know I'm on my way to see you. We need to talk face to face. I'm taking off in a little, so please call me if you get this. - Where are you travelling to? - Auckland. - How long is the flight? - About 14 and a half hours. Sweet. - This lying scumbag piece of shit. - What did you expect from him? I expected him to honour the deal he agreed to. - He was never going to. - He has never honoured anything. - But you still want this. - More than I want my wife to crave pussy, but I will not be controlled by that rotting old douchebag. - I was for too long. - It's a fair deal though, Ari. For whatever reason, he's being more than fair, and you know that if you drop this ball the whole town is gonna dive for this. What the hell? He's weak. I don't know why, but he is. Just get the deal done. - Andrew. - Terrance. Nice to see you. Didn't realise you were still in the business. - Die. - Not for you. Not for any TV agents. - Hello, Ari. - I should kick your ass for wasting my time. Remember when you first came to work for me? We used to go spar at my gym. I'd kick your ass. - You were my boss. I let you win. - I could still kick your ass and you know it. Listen, you crawled over here for a reason. - What is it? - I want to make this deal work. Then I suggest that you go find a buyer who will let you push them around, cos it ain't gonna be me. I want you to buy it. Why? Because you miss having some sort of control over me? I'm smart enough to know that I never had control over you. No. Not while I was working for you. Or shall I say "with" you? I was your number-one asset. We used to laugh at all those other dickheads. But you became one when you threw me out of the company that I built! Look, let's put the past behind us. The future is yours. Don't destroy my legacy out of spite. Admit that you destroyed me out of spite, out of bitterness and out of jealousy. Is that what all this is about? You want me to apologise? Poor hurt little boy still pines for his daddy's approval? I became too big for you and you couldn't handle it. No, I couldn't handle your rotten ego - or your extraordinary salary demands! - Bullshit. So this is why you won't let me keep my name? If you don't like it, you can go find someone else. I don't want anyone else. You're the only one who can take this company forward for the next 50 years. - Well, then apologise. - I just did. It was a mistake that I kicked you out, Ari, all right? I was just feeling unneeded. Well, you were needed. Well, you know you're gonna grow old someday, Ari. Hopefully you'll find someone who'll be able to help you do it gracefully. I'll let you keep your name. Make it last. You've got a roomful of people that are very excited that you changed your mind and decided to come in. I'm just glad you guys are still willing to see me. Truth is, Phil begged us to see you again, and I'm... I'm questioning the reluctance. Are you not feeling this role? - No, no, no. - Well, what, then? For a minute there I didn't think I wanted this any more. But then it hit me. What I don't want any more is the rejection. 18 years of it has taken its toll. I was on this show once before, and I was on another series for the past 87 episodes. I've done over 140 guest spots on TV and other movies, 16 plays, 39 commercials... yet still you haven't seen enough to just offer me the part, still you make me sing for my supper. - Hey, if you don't want to... - No, it doesn't matter if I want to. I have to. There you go. That's the spirit. Roll this. Do it, Johnny. Here we go! - They basically gave me the part in the room. - Yeah? Yeah, Yagoda said I was pitch perfect. I even got a sincere thumbs up from that jerkoff director. You should have stopped caring a long time ago. - No shit. - I guess this means I'm going to Italy alone? I don't have an official offer and I don't want to jinx it, but... sorry, bro, looks like you're solo. - I'm proud of you, Johnny. - Thanks, Vince. - Later. - Later. I don't know why you're so angry. I said I was sorry. - You rejected me, I feel bad enough. - You should be used to that by now. I was wrong. The guys told me you were over me and I didn't believe them. And you usually listen to every word the guys say. I know. It's just that even though we've been apart for three years, I always believed that one day I'd have you, a house, kids... You mean "we". - I don't follow. - "We" would have a house and kids. You're a selfish prick. You follow that? Why is it selfish cos I'm trying to tell you I want to be with you? Because last time you convinced me it was forever - then took off with your buddies... - I was trying to get my business going. - You took me for granted. - I know. - Eric, why are you doing this to me? - Because I love you. I will not get lured back into this. I can't trust you. You love to have a girlfriend, but on your terms. You're never gonna be able to commit. Not to anyone! That is not true. I will commit to you right now! - Eric, stop! - I swear to God! I'll marry you. - You'll marry me? - Yes! I will get in that car right now, drive to Vegas and commit to you for the rest of my life. Really? Have you even thought about this? Yeah, I have. And this time, I swear on my life... it'll be forever. - Jesse. How have you been? - I've been... Great. I'm back and you're fired. Hello, all. No need to run. Your fates have already been sealed. - You're safe. - Oh my God. You're safe, for now. Hello, nice to see you. Who's your best client? Jesus! I represent Jon Kate Plus Eight. Where are you, Davies? I'm already packing to save myself the indignity. That's too bad. Ari... Jesus Christ! Have you lost your mind, Ari? Now where's Lloyd Lee? Mr Lee knew that you were coming, Mr Gold. - He decided not to wait for your arrival. - Now why don't I believe you? Now, Lloyd, maybe you're not here, maybe you are. Either way, you have nothing to fear because I'm not gonna kill you. I love you. You see, even though you betrayed me, you were the best slave that I ever had. I mean, who could possibly replace the way that you picked up my dry-cleaning? No one! Who could better the way you picked up my dog's shit? And if I liked short, fat men sucking on my dick, I'm sure that no one could do it better than you either. So, return to the king or exile yourself from this town forever. You have until the end of the day tomorrow to agree to be rebranded mine! Welcome aboard, ladies and gentlemen. Excuse me, ma'am. If there's a seat left with an open one next to it, I'd love to grab that. - As would I. - I'm sorry, but I think the flight is full. Awesome. Jamie. Jesus, why haven't you called me? - Turtle, where are you? - I'm on my way to you. I don't want you to do that. I don't want to see other people. I can't believe you'd think that I would. - Turtle. - Excuse me, sir. You have to get off your phone. We're preparing for takeoff. - Just one minute, please. - Sir. Turtle, please don't come here. I said you should see other people because I don't want you to resent me, but... I was just being weak. Weak? How? The truth is, I don't want to end up resenting you. - Why would you resent me? - Because I could be gone for a year, and if the show is successful I could be gone for five. - So you want to see other people? - I don't know what I want. But I've done the long-distance thing before and I ended up getting really hurt. I would never want that to happen to either of us. It's not like I won't come see you. You've worked so hard this year to get your life going. You can't be flying back and forth to New Zealand. - I can make it work. - It wouldn't work. And if we're ever gonna have a chance in the future, we shouldn't try. I didn't see this coming. I really do love you. Sir, you need to get off the phone right now. OK, then. Turtle, I'm sorry. Yeah. I've got to get off this plane. - I gotta get off this plane. - I'm sorry, that's not possible. The door is closed. We've already pulled away from the gate. I can't go to New Zealand. - I gotta get off this plane now. - Sit down. Put your seat belt on. What if I yell bomb? Then you can get off the plane and you can go straight to jail and pay a $250,000 fine. Thank you. We gotta roll. You're gonna miss your flight. I'm flying private. They won't leave till I get there. Oh, yeah, I forgot. - No word from E? - Or Turtle. It's Phil Yagoda. Hey, Phil. Give me something officially great. - You blew us all away at the audition. - You told me that yesterday. I wanted to tell you again. - So did I get it or not? - In my mind you did. - Whose other mind is there? - The network's. - They didn't like me? - They did like you. But? - They think you're too old. - But I'm not. They think you are. I didn't shave yesterday. I could cut my hair. They're going younger, John. I guess they gotta do what they gotta do. I gotta tell you, I thought you were gonna put up a little more of a fight. I got no fight left in me, Phil. - I left it all in that room. - I know you did. - And so does the network. - Cool. In fact, they said that they think you are finally ready to carry something. Great. Let me know when they got something. They want to start developing something for you now. They want to give you a holding deal and they want to make sure that nobody snags you up. Really? I've never had a holding deal before. Good times ahead, John. - Thanks, Phil. - You got it. Bye. They want to develop something for me to star in. - Johnny, that's amazing. - Yeah! And even more amazing, I'm coming to Italy. You gotta pack. I brought some bags just in case. A holding deal. It sucks the guys are gonna miss this. It sucks for them. Thanks for flying. Goodbye. - Thank you. - Any idea how quick I can get to Rome? You just flew in from LA. I'm trying to break the Guinness record for most miles in 24 hours. What's it to you? - I didn't really think you'd show. - I didn't come for work. - What did you come for? - To tell you to go fuck yourself. - Watch it, Lloyd... - Don't tell me what to do. Don't you dare let yourself be convinced that I betrayed you. You abused me, and you won't ever again. But I will work myself to the bone so that someday I will be in a position to abuse you. You're not so smart. How could you be, if you actually believed I would ever work for you again? So you wouldn't work for me if you were an agent? You think I'll fall for this, then you'll laugh in my face. I'm serious. You just showed me balls I didn't know you had. So that speech made you believe I should be an agent? I believed it before you got here. Terrance apologised to me. I... I'm sorry, Lloyd. - I still think you're fucking with me. - Go check your office. It's supposed to say "agent". All right. Get off. Turtle's gonna meet us in Italy. - What happened with Jamie? - He didn't say. - What, is Damon coming? - Oh, Jesus! What the hell? Unbelievable. Hey, Matty! What, are you following me? No, no. Pure coincidence. Told you I was going to Cleveland. You guys know LeBron? He gave up his vacation for the kids. Hey, LeBron! Hey, big fan, man. Big fan! - Hey. - Hey. - So did you get the cheque I sent? - Yeah, I did. - Hope it was enough. - It wasn't. You guys are flying a private to Italy, huh? Must be nice. - Yeah. - Good living. And what are you guys doing here? Saving the geese from an untimely death? We're on a charitable mission, John. The jet was donated by Marquis, as well as the carbon offset. - We're good. - Touché. - I want a big fucking cheque from you. - How big? What are you making this year? 20 million? Ari told me 20 mil. Yeah, give or take. - And you only gave 10 Gs? - That is a little light, bro. I didn't know what was appropriate. What did you give, LeBron? I'll match it. I gave a million, Vince. - Send a buck fifty. - I was gonna say 200, but that's good. Yeah? - It's for the kids. - It's for the kids. - Done. - Good. Yo, yo! Hey, yo, E! Call Marvin. Have him write a cheque for 150 grand to Matt's charity. - OK. Hey, guys. - What's up? Matty D, Bron! Let's hit it. - All good? - As good as always, Kenny D. - Let's do it. Jimmy Edmonds, JC. Let's go. - Later, fellas. - See you, Vince. - Bye, LeBron. - 150 Gs? - It's for the kids. - Hey, Sloan. - Hey. - Hey, Sloan. - Hi, honey. - So where you been, kid? - Long lunch? - Lunch ended yesterday. - And it was a disaster. And yet you have no luggage? Great Mother of God. You gotta be kidding me. We got engaged. I was gonna marry her, but... We knew you guys and my dad would kill us if you missed it. - We would have. - Congratulations. Thanks. Congratulations. Welcome to the gang. I wish we could stay and celebrate, audition some bridesmaids, if you know what I mean. I promise you will have plenty of time for that. So, I'm assuming you're not coming. Well, no. First trip no E. We're gonna come visit though. You son of a bitch. Congratulations. - I know you're gonna kill it, Vince. - No doubt. You take care of that girl, you lucky bastard. If you don't, Johnny Drama will. So are you regretting this yet? Not in the slightest. I know I'm gonna regret this, but you if you want to go with, I understand. Really? - Yeah. - I love you. Yo, guys! Wait up! I'm kidding! The guy's down for the count. Which one of us do you think will be next? I have no idea, Johnny. Vince, this is Matt Damon. Listen, I just had a really disturbing phone call with the foundation. It's been a week. I'm in Haiti at the moment. I understand your cheque has not come. It has not come, Vince. Don't you fucking push me, Vince. Don't push me. Send the cheque! You do what's right, Vince. You gave me your word. You gave LeBron your word. Let me tell you something. I never even thought you were a fucking good actor. I thought you were terrible. Everything I... Aquaman, Queens Boulevard - they stink. They fucking stink. I can't even believe you have money to give to a foundation, but the fact is that you do and you gave me your word that you would. So give me the fucking cheque, Vince! I can't believe I have a fucking Academy Award and I am calling you back! Again and again and again, you cocksucker! Send me the cheque! Hey, Vince. It's Matt. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, buddy. That was really out of line, and I didn't mean that. I'm just... I'm just... I'm just a little tired, man, and... I'm sorry. The helicopter was waiting for me, gunfire going of all around, but I couldn't leave. As long as I live, I'll never forget the faces of those children All right, we get it. Darfur is a bummer. But who wants those images in their head? She's amazing. I can't believe you get to work for her. What you do sounds a lot more fun, especially during fashion week. Yeah, well, fashion week isn't nearly as cool as genocide week. Sorry. That came out wrong. You can read the piece in this month's "New York Review." Brilliant and depressing, but mostly brilliant. Ms. Mastronardi has offered to stay a few minutes if anyone wants to talk to her. And no asking for jobs. Something's been bothering me, and I'm thinking you could help. -Is this brown? -Yes Because, you know, I never had the big 64 crayons that every other kid had.. so I don't know all the obscure colors like, uh... -Brown? -Uh, mocha or mud or tree bark. -Those aren't really colors. Oh, well, leave it to fashion girl to clear that up. Oh, uh, no. I'm not fashion girl. -I'm fashion girl. -But you work at "Mode." I'm sports guy. You're fashion girl. -We're known by our magazines. -Okay What do you do at "Mode"? Um, excuse me. Actually, um, I'm an assistant to the editor-in-chief, but I've gotten to do other things. Like, sometimes I write a column for the web site, and earlier this year I got to oversee a cover shoot. Sounds like you're on a great path to becoming a fashion editor. Oh, thanks. Yeah, but, um, I got into Y.E.T.I. Because I'm interested in other magazines. Like, one day, I would love to do what you do. Then you might want to get off the fashion track, and get some other experience, because right now, fashion's where you're heading. Oh, okay. So I suggested to Jodie that anyone who wanted should pair up with a partner from another magazine, and that way,we can get experience from different places. Have you not got enough going on at fashion week? Yeah, but if I get the girl from "The New York Review", then it would totally be worth it. -That would be a good fit for you. Right? I mean, I love it here, but I've just never seen myself being in fashion forever, and for once, I would like to be in a place that comes more natural, and then people would stop calling me fashion girl. Who's calling you fashion girl? This morning, you've got the Donna Karan preview, followed by brunch with Donna Karan and then the Donna Karan show. So I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume that you are wearing-- Cavalli. Are you sure? I'm worried that the cavalli makes you look a little too "Michelle Obama at the mall." Ugh. Remember what we said about unsolicited opinions? Yes, yes, I do. Uh, it's just-- -The Cavalli, please. Have I told you lately what a remarkable body you have? Ugh! You'd never even know you're about to have a child. -Give me the damn dress. -They didn't send it What? Well, why not? -Well. Since you've been seeing Connor, you haven't been working the circuit as much, and it's possible that you might have... fallen off their radar. -Oh, that is ridiculous. -Of course it is. Wilhelmina slater is the most important person at fashion week. A "yes" from me determines style. Do you remember micro buckles of '04? -Um, no. No, not really. -Exactly. Because I said no. Now if the cavalli was not sent, it was because of human error. Don't let it happen again. Yeah, make sure I'm sitting near Phillip Lim at Peter Som, and nowhere near Peter Som at Phillip Lim. Or is it the other way around? You'll figure it out. Um, more importantly, I really need you to deal with these. Last year, the mandate was for cuffs to be peering out from jackets. At Marc Jacobs' preview last night, suddenly they're peeking instead. Can you believe it? -Nope, I can't. -I mean, it was humiliating. I need an 1/8 of an inch off all them asap. Please use your discretion. I'd be mortified if anyone knew they were mine. Daniel, do you think you have any non-fashion related assignments for me? It's fashion week at a fashion magazine, Betty. I mean, I do have this press release you could write. It's for this designer Heinrich. Last minute addition at the "Mode" show, but... I'll take it. Knowing how to write a press release is useful anywhere. Okay, I'm ready for fashion week. Wow! You look beautiful. Thank you. Everything I'm wearing hurts. That's good, right? Uh, whatever it is you're doing, it definitely works for me. Shall we? -Bye. -Have fun. Peering? My God, Daniel. Have some self-respect. Hey, Betty. We're having a little going-away party for Elena. You want to say good-bye before she goes away? It's Betty! Good-bye, Elena! Bye, Betty! We are gonna miss her so much. Okay, all right. We all know you're very excited she's leaving, but maybe you could tone it back just a little bit. Hey, I'm just happy that papi's better, and he doesn't need a nurse anymore. Oh, good, 'cause I don't think this means they're gonna stop seeing each other. Ugh. Please. Once that kinky Florence Nightingale fantasy is over, it's done. Haven't I asked you not to use the word "kinky" concerning our father? Look, I have to go. Oh! Wish me luck with "The New York Review." -Good luck! -Bye. Okay, now I mentioned last week that we'd be picking partners. I advise you,choose carefully, because you will be working with this person all year. And if you're like me, you'll hook up, get married, get married, cheat, divorce and end up bitter and alone, but I digress. Okay! Let's... pick... partners! Oh, I am so excited you want to work with me! Totally! Not just because of the giant cookie you sent to my office. Oh. Was it good? All right, is everyone sitting next to the person they picked? Now turn to the person on the other side, and meet your new partner. In publishing, you must expect the unexpected. -I get fashion girl. -And I get sports guy. And one last thing.. your assignment this week is to trail your partner at work. Come back ready to discuss five things you learn about each other's magazines, and nothing stupid. Class dismissed. Jodie. Um, I don't mean to question you. It's just.. See, I already work at Fashion magazine, and I was kinda hoping that I could do something a little more meaningful, and I don't know what I can learn working with the sports guy. Who's right behind you. Awkward. Hey, why don't we just switch partners? -I mean, you don't want to learn about fashion. -No, I do, and I know that you are the perfect person to teach me. We are gonna knock this assignment out of the park. That's a sports thing. I'm gonna teach you all about that. Ugly Betty Season 03, episode 15 "There's no place like Mode" Matt, I promise we will get to the tour. It's just, fashion week is crazy, and Daniel has, like, a million messages. Hey, no problem. So did you always know that you wanted to work in fashion? -Um, no, not really. -So how'd you end up here? What? Oh, I'm sorry. I was listening to the message. Oh, sorry. You were talking. I thought it was okay. And I missed it again. That's okay. I can just do this later. Oh, Amanda? I have to write a press release on Heinrich. -What do you know about him? -Never heard of him. He must suck. -Wow. Heinrich..he's great. -What, you know heinrich? -No. -Oh, 'cause you just acted like you knew him. I wasn't expecting the follow-up. Sorry. Oh, Daniel. You were all over the papers today. -Really? -Yes. Ahem. "Looking sensational at Michael Kors' was 'Mode's' Daniel Meade. He was accompanied by..." Ugh! -What? -Nothing. I just remembered I can't read. -It's my own secret shame. -Amanda, what does it say? "His new girlfriend/charity case.. a frump with a pulled-back hairstyle that even a turn-of-the-century librarian would deem too severe." See? That is not so bad. They didn't mention her big ears. Well, that's insane. Molly looked fantastic. Oh, not according to this one. "Daniel meade might want to see a dermatologist. He seemed to have a 5'5' woman-shaped growth on his arm." Okay, now that one's clever. You've gotta laugh at that. Hello? Heinrich? I think the door is open. All right. I've never done this before. I'm a little nervous. So if you have any questions, maybe wait till after. Got it. -Oh! Is he dead? S-sorry. That was a question. Excuse me. Are you Heinrich? I am The Heinrich. Heinrich for short. I'm Betty Suarez from "Mode." This is my colleague Matt. I'm going to write your press release. We will make love..not today, but someday. Ay.Are those your dresses? They're very nice. They... are.. garbage. This is what we will present at the "Mode" show. Wings. They have wings. I don't know, though. I kind like this photo he's given you. -I like the way it catches the light. -That's shards of glass! The dress is on the mannequin 'cause the models won't even sign the release to wear that thing. Well, who am I to judge anyone? Two years ago, I was the "Mode" designer to watch. Now look at me..knocked up with someone else's kid, forced to take Brad Pitt's cuffs by an 1/8 of an inch. So the closet is just, like, a really big closet? There is no comparison between The Heinrich and The Christina. Well, it's very kind of you to say, but no one's writing a press release about me, are they? So do they ever give you any of the clothes? 'Cause if I'm covering a game and one of the guys is throwing out a bloody jersey, sometimes I get to keep that. Score! That's cool. Hey, Matt, this is probably so boring for you. Do you want to go back to my desk and read back issues? It's such a good way to learn. And you can open my confidential drawer. Don't worry. It's just snacks. He seems interesting. I know. It's just a really bad time to have somebody following me. I mean, I was willing to make the sacrifice for "The New York Review," but "Sports Experience? That's not really gonna help me. All right, what am I gonna say about this thing? Come here. Here we go. "For immediate release"... "It has been said fashion is pain." -You can't write that. -No, no, no. I can. I can. No write. It's good for a laugh. Okay, but this is just for us. "Science said no, but Heinrich said yes!" "So get your tetanus shots, and prepare to bleed." Here you go. I changed "shiny" to "glittering", and added the words "breakout designer" a few times. -It's good. -Thank you so much, Justin. It was so hard for me to get anything done at work yesterday with all of matt's questions. Ooh! Before I forget, I only get two tickets to the "Mode" show this year, -so we have to decide who's going. -I get one or I tell everyone that you still like Ricky Martin. I'm sorry. I have to play hardball. -Mama made pancakes! Ooh! Someone's in a good mood. Well, guess who's not taking papi's blood pressure this morning? Nurse skank. -Hilda. Ay. Let me enjoy myself. Eat your pancakes. Look, smiley face. -Aww, chocolate chip eyes! -Morning. -Morning. You have the same hideous robe as grandpa? It's not hideous. It's, um, retro. And obviously, we have some things to talk about. I just hope we can be, um, mature about it. Oh, sure. I got no problem being mature. Uh, I gotta get to work. You know, fashion week, all of that. Sorry. Talk to you later. Stand up! You too, on yourfeet! Thank you for letting us come, ma'am. - Make yourselves at home. May our homes always be together. - We've always been together. Even ourgrandfathers were like brothers we've never fought. Fike is very good friends with my grandsons. That's what I thought too. So let's agree to have your Fatime and my son engaged. Let's fix them up while they still listen to us. It's an honorto have our daughter become a memberof your family... but we never knew about this. Her parents and her brothers knew nothing! Am I right? I swearon Fatime's head, we knew nothing. We're waiting for yourword. Where are Fatime's parents? - What? Where are Fatime's parents? - In Italy, with herother two brothers. How many brothers has she got? - Six. There's one in Australia too. Keep youreyes open, my dear. Our kids have grown up. You can't control them any more. They've got no mother, no father. Koli will be like a brother to them. If anything happens, they'll burn the mountaineers' house down. And then civil warwill break out. I don't know what to do, he's my guest. I've given him my besa. I know, but I don't want any trouble, hear me? Let me talk to her. Wake her up, yes. Hello? Hello! How are you, sweetie? I love you so much! Hello? Where did she go? Let me talk to her. Hey, Koli! Did you wash the car? Weather's getting worse in Tirana. I was there one day. It was raining hard. I liked it. Sometimes there's a lot of thunder. The girls get scared. They scream, squeal and start running around. And your girlfriend comes to cuddle with you? How old is your daughter? Three. She's lovely. What is it? Let's go. Look who's here. I'm afraid he's here for me. - No, he spies forthe one in Italy. And tells him that you're with me? Where's Koli? - He'll be here any minute. Why? Has he told you how long he'll stay? - As if you don't know. Ask him yourself. One day, they're going to kill him right there. And I'm not worried about him. My concern is for you. You could get yourselfkilled too. - What kind of talk is this? Just wait and see. Are you suggesting dumping the guy? Who's been talking to you? Why don't you offer him protection? You and your new brothers! Have you been drinking again? I'll see you, Koli. Fike, whatwas Zef bitching about? Koli, have a been with us. Have a beer, don't turn me down! - Don't turn him down! Cheers! - Cheers! How's it going with you, Koli? Fine. How are you getting along with Zef? - Fine. As long as you can count on us, you needn't worry. Cheers! Enough, let the poor guy drink in peace. - Let's drink a little! There's nothing they can do to you. Koli, would you like a smoke? Thanks, buddy, but I don't smoke. - You should, it helps you fight gloom. Why should he feel gloomy? They don't have the balls to come here. Cheers. - Stop it, man. What's the problem? Can we have more beer? Cheers! Good evening. Good evening. Where is the girl who lives here? - My daughter-in-law? She's gone. Is she coming back - I don't know. Good night, grandma. Good night. How's it going, old timer? Is the door open? Where are you going? - To my room. Who are you? Koli! I didn't recognize you! You've gotten so tan. Hold on, I'm coming. You lostweight! What happehed? I missed you. I wanted to come and see you but I didn't have youraddress. That's okay. You've always been perfectly okay, even when the rest of us were in dire straits. Your parents pay for your tuition. Shut up, then. That's true, but I don't buy my way through the exams. It's better to give away money than anything else. Are you kidding me? Hey, you're ruining my party! Calm down! Let's dance. Come on. Why are you alone? - I just can't stand the mayhem. What are you studying? - English. You? Albanian literature. Why haven't I seen you at school? I'm a freshman. You? - Asophomore. That's why. - Koli. Keti. Hillbilly. Diana's waiting for you. Keti, let's dance. Isn't she talking to someone alreadky We're here to have fun. - You could've asked for permission. What's wrong with you, man? I've had enough of these trite jokes! Calm down, calm down. May your kids live a long, happy life! Good morning. Would you like a drink? Are you new here? - I started working two weeks ago. An espresso and a glass of water, please. - We serve bottled water only. Then just bring me the coffee. Koli! Tirana is such a mess. It's so peaseful in the village. Anything new from your enemies? Nothing. I haven't heard anything at all. We've brought you something. What's this? - Don't ask Open itwhen you're alone. I just want to know what it is. - You'll need it. And don'ttell anyone, noteven Diana. You came all the way for this? - Yes. And there's something else. What? Koli, our elder brother is involved in some business. We want to help you leave the country. Every now and then, a fishing boat sails off from the old seaport. You don't need passports, visas, embassies, oranything... Just get away from here. Everybody does it. And go where? - Wherever you want. Germany, Italy... Nobody knows who you are. Think about it. Let's go. We've got to go. - Wait, let's have another beer. No, we have to go. And this one's on us. Good bye, Fike. - Bye. I'll come visit you. Is my bed still there? Nobody dares touch it. Take care. I will. Give my regards to Zef. Where were you? - Here. Who were those guys you were with? - You saw me? I walked by. Some relatives from the countryside. Whatwas in that package they gave you? - Nothing. Well, there was something. Why don't you tell me? Fine. Don't say anything. I know what you've been through all this time. Justtry to leave it behind you. Then you'll be able to catch up on hope you get him when they come out the door. If they come out the back door, we got 'em. What if they go back in the hospital? We can't have that. Nobody's guarding the back of the hospital. This is a Big Daddy with a big ten-four... What about the girl? We kill everybody. No! Please. Shit, sir. Move it! - Which way to the boat? - The door. Over there. Rachel, run! - Eddie! - Go! Go! One, two... Come on, baby. Come on. Black bastard! I'll kill you! - Rachel, get out! - Come on. Get out! - Where's the boat? - Over there. Damn you! I'm gonna get that motherfucker. I'm OK. Come on. All right! Nobody kicks my dog, motherfucker! Oh, shit! Motherfucker! - You fucking wimpo doctor! - I am not a doctor! We some bad black motherfuckers, ain't we? Damn right, bubba. Are you all right? Take care of them. Not them. Him! All right. Come on, Stucky. Let's say your files were destroyed in the fire. Thanks. You're free and clear. You can start all over. - I like the sound of that. - Get outta here, Lennihan. - Damn, bubba. - You the man, Lennihan. You take it easy, Fido. - Why couldn't you be Dr Slattery? - I wish I could be who you wanted. - But I'm not. - I think you might be, Mr Lennihan. - Would you have dinner with me? - I'd like that. Very much. Eight hours ago, I was a lunatic in an insane asylum. Right? Now I got a yacht. I met a nice lady. Proud to be an American. MAN: ...to recover contents such as shoes, socks and undergarments. And now an item of special note. Barring any change in the weather, the softball game between the 133rd and 4th Infantry Divisions will resume as scheduled at the Ban Mi Thout Park, corner of Viet Ho and Hguen Van Theiuh streets here in Saigon. Please make a note of it. Ahem. Excuse me. Those men who lost equipment in last week's rains are asked to contact Lieutenant Sam Scheer. Lieutenant Schneer... Lieutenant Scheer asks those men with waterlogged mitts to make every effort to dry them out in the sun before requesting new ones. Bookworms, Headquarters Support Activities Saigon operates libraries at six locations in the Republic of Vietnam. American personnel can check out a book in Ku Bai, Da Nang, Phung Tao, Saigon, Bien Hoa and San Treng. If you can't stop in and select your own books, write to the HSAS Library. Ask for the books by author, title and subject, and your selections will be mailed to you. With the holiday season rapidly approaching, those personnel wishing to spend Christmas cards home... Wishing to send Christmas cards home to the States are asked to do so no later than August 13th due to a yearly mail rush at that time. Don't disappoint your...

The Armed Forces sincerely regrets any inconvenience due to luggage lost on transport carriers. Personal missing luggage... That should be personnel missing luggage. ...are asked to drop a card to Major Gerald Kleiner over at the 5th. The card should be no larger than 4-by-5 inches and should describe the contents of your duffel. Major Kleiner requests that you do not describe your duffel, as all duffels look alike. Those personnel with lost bag... MAN 1: Yeah, that's right, man. MAN 2: Hurry up, man. MAN 3: All right. MAN 4: Hey, sarge, where are the women? - Airman Cronauer? - You got it. Welcome to Saigon, sir. - Careful, you could put an eye out. - God, it's warm, huh? CRONAUER: Warm? No, this is a setting for London broil. GARLICK: I'm Private First Class Edward Montesque-Garlick, sir. CRONAUER: Well, first thing, Garlick, is you gotta requisition a new name. GARLICK: Heh-heh-heh. I like you already, sir. Actually, what I am, sir, is your Armed Forces Radio Saigon assistant who's in charge of orientation and billeting of enlisted personnel and company clerk. CRONAUER: I'm impressed. [ENGINE GRINDS] - It's already started. - I understand. [GARLICK LAUGHS] ["DREAM ON LITTLE DREAMER" PLAYING ON RADIO] LEVITAN [ON RADIO]: This is AFRS, Radio Saigon. AFRS Radio is owned and operated by the United States government and operates on an assigned carrier frequency of 540 at 749 megahertz. Jesus, that guy's as boring as whale shit. Not really. See, the purpose is to inform you as to the radius of the radio waves. Mantovani? They play Mantovani to insomniacs who don't respond to strong drugs. General likes easy listening. I have to inform you... Mayday. Dragon lady with incredible figure at 11 o'clock, stop the car. GARLICK: I can't, sir. CRONAUER: You don't understand. I've been on a Greek island with women who look like Zorba. I never thought I'd find women attractive again. Now that I do, you won't turn the car around? - Thanks a lot. - You have a very important meeting. There she is again. How did she get ahead of us? GARLICK: That's another person, sir. She's beautiful and quick. Speed up, check her stamina. This is incredible. Oh, my God. They're quick, they're fast and small. [CRONAUER LAUGHS] I feel like a fox in a chicken coop. MAN: We got a new man coming in. Don't you understand, Dick? DICKERSON: No, sir, frankly, I do not understand. Would you kindly lower your tone, please? Yes, sir. I run this show, general. If anything screws up, it's my ass in the mower. I deserve to be notified of any changes that are made. Nobody's arguing that with you. Look, I caught his show on the Isle of Crete, and this guy is funny. I damn near busted a gut laughing at him. And the troops, they love him. This is a tempest in a teacup. Much ado about nothing. For crying out loud, man, this isn't brain surgery. Don't get crazy over this, Dick. We're only talking about a damn deejay. There is no such thing as "only" anymore. Not now, not in Saigon. Lieutenant Steven Hauk is our immediate supervisor. He's a little goofy, but he's okay. Sergeant Major Dickerson, ha, that's another story altogether. He was a commander of an elite special forces unit. He came to us because of prostrate problems and some sort of social infection that doesn't go away. Plus, I think he got shot in the ass, but I can't confirm that. Heh-heh-heh. Anyway, he's the man that you don't want to aggravate. CRONAUER: Are you always this happy? TAYLOR: Cronauer. - Sir. At ease. I'm General Taylor. - Hi, general. - Real pleasure. Listen, if you have any problems here now, you come see me. I'm the tallest hog in the trough around here. - Garlick, have you put on some weight? - I don't think so, sir. My son, the shadow of your ass would weigh 20 pounds. GARLICK: I'll work on that, sir. You're not supposed to address the general saying hi. CRONAUER: Is that a new rule? GARLICK: No, old rule. - That's Lieutenant Hauk in there. - Who's the guy with the ears? How you doing? You could fly to Guam with those. Um, Airman Cronauer, sir. You know, it wouldn't kill you people to salute me once in a while. - Sorry. HAUK: Thanks. I understand you're pretty funny as a deejay. And, well, comedy is a kind of hobby of mine. Well, actually, it's a little more than just a hobby. Reader's Digest is considering publishing two of my jokes. - Really? - Yeah. And perhaps some night, we could maybe get together - and swap humourous stories for fun. CRONAUER: Yeah. Why not? Maybe play a couple of Tennessee Ernie Ford records. That'd be a hoot, heh. - That's a joke, right? - Maybe. - I get it. CRONAUER: Mm-hm. Where's this man's paperwork? - Right here, sergeant. - Thank you, sir. Hmm. United States Air Force. The hat does give you away. This is not military issue, airman. What sort of uniform is that? Cretan camouflage. If you wanna blend into a crowd of drunken Greeks, there's nothing better. That is humour. I recognise that. I also recognise your species of soldier. I had a guy like you in the field one time. He blew himself to pieces. But not before his humour cost the lives of three very fine individuals. - I hope... - You shut your fucking hole. You're in Southeast Asia now, pal. You got your cushy little assignment. There's nothing I can do about that. In time, you will make me forget it. You stay out of my way, there'll be no problem. But if you toy with me, I'll burn you so bad you'll wish you died as a child. Am I being fairly clear? - Yes, sir. - Sir? I work for a living, airman. You will address me as Sergeant Major Dickerson. Yes, Sergeant Major Dickerson. He reminds me a lot of Donna Reed, especially around the eyes. Hello, hello, hello. This is your chaplain, Captain Noel, [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING ON TAPE] your radio programme of personal beliefs. Great and manifold are our blessings today. This great, godly miracle of radio really gives me the opportunity to speak to you on the air. Sir, it's time to rise. My God, it's Mardi gras, and I'm on the main float. Come on, sir. In a couple of weeks, this'll be easy for you. - Oh, let me go back to bed. - You gotta get up, sir. - God, what time is it, Edward? - It's 5:30. Five-thirty, it's very early. I may have to hurt you. - Call me in five minutes. - No, we have to get up right now. - And you have to get on the air. - Oh. - Come on, sir. - Fine. MAN [ON RADIO]: --has signed Les Crane to a talk show. GARLICK: It's just down the hall. CRONAUER: Yeah. - You must be nervous, sir, huh? - I'm not even in my body. GARLICK: Don't worry, it'll go great. This way, sir. MAN [ON RADIO]: --despite a letter of intention. We still have a few minutes before your show begins, sir. When it's time to read the news, you just take it off these machines here. But regardless of what you read, airman, the Department of Defence wants final say. So every item's checked by these two guys in here. Guys, I'd like you to meet our new deejay, Adrian Cronauer. That's Marty Lee Dreiwitz. ...Guy Monaco. He's impeccably clean. This man has cleaning products shipped in from Wisconsin. He's also one of your roommates, so if I were you, I'd think about suicide. Sir, I really don't think that you wanna use any of those records, sir. We have a selection right here that's prepared... I've been looking forward to meeting you. Listen, could you do me a favour? Can you say something funny right this minute? - I doubt it. - Ha-ha-ha. I'm with you, man. I'm on your frequency. Hey, let me ask you a question. What is the appeal of Joey Bishop? I mean, the man's not funny. I know funny and he's not funny. Don't get me wrong, he seems like a nice guy, but my father's nice and he's not funny either. Joey Bishop. I wish someone would explain this one to me. Incidentally, you're on the air in about ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six... Hey, this has been Fiction and Fact from Marty Lee's almanac. And now direct from Crete, welcome the silky smooth sound of Airman Adrian Cronauer. [YELLS] Good morning, Vietnam. Hey, this is not a test. This is rock 'n' roll. Time to rock it from the Delta to the DMZ. Is that me, or does that sound like an Presley movie? [SINGING AS ELVIS PRESLEY] Viva Da Nang, oh, viva Da Nang Da Nang me, Da Nang me Why don't they get a rope and hang me? [IN NORMAL VOICE] Is it a little too early for being that loud? Hey, too late. It's 0600. What's the O stand for? "Oh, my God, it's early." Speaking of early, how about that Cro-Magnon, Marty Dreiwitz? Thank you for "silky smooth sound." Make me sound like Peggy Lee. "Good morning, Vietnam"? What the heck is that supposed to mean? I don't know, lieutenant. I guess it means good morning, uh, Vietnam. And who gave anyone permission to program modern music? Freddie and the Dreamers. [SONG PLAYING AT HALF-SPEED] [SLOWLY] Wrong speed. We've got it on the wrong speed. For those of you recovering from a hangover, that's gonna sound just right. Let's pull her right back down. Let's try it faster, see if that picks it up. [RAPIDLY] Let's get it up on 17, 18... [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] Those pilots are going, "I like the music, I like the music." Oh, still a bad song. Hey, wait a minute. Let's try something. Let's play this backwards and see if it gets any better. [SPEAKING BACKWARDS] Freddie is the devil. Freddie is the devil. [GASPS] [HUMS "THE TWILIGHT ZONE" THEME SONG] [AS ROD SERLING] Picture a man going on a journey beyond sight and sound. He's left Crete. He's entered the demilitarised zone. [SCATS] [IN NORMAL VOICE] What is this demilitarised zone? What do they mean, police action? CRONAUER: Sounds like a couple of cops in Brooklyn, "She looks pretty to me." Whatever it is, I like it because it gets you on your toes better than a strong cup of cappuccino. What is a demilitarised zone? Sounds like something out of The Wizard of Oz. [AS GLINDA] Oh, no, don't go in there. [SINGING IN DEEP VOICE] Oh-he-oh Ho Chi Minh [AS GLINDA] Oh, look, you've landed in Saigon. You're among the little people now. [SINGING AS MUNCHKIN] We represent the ARVIN Army The ARVIN Army Oh, no, follow the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Follow the Ho Chi Minh Trail. [AS WITCH] Oh, I'll get you, my pretty. [IN NORMAL VOICE] It's the Wicked Witch of the North. It's Hanoi Hannah. [AS WITCH] Now, little GI, you and your little Toto too. [CACKLES] [AS HANOI HANNAH] Oh, Adrian, Adrian. What are you doing, Adrian? [IN NORMAL VOICE] Hannah, you slut. You've been down on everything but the Titanic. Stop it right now. You know, he's really funny. You know, he's like a Marx brother. And which Marx brother would that be, private? Zeppo? - I don't find him funny at all. - Zeppo? Isn't he the one with the hat? Hey, hi, can you help me? What's your name? [SOLDIER] Roosevelt E. Roosevelt. [NORMAL] What town are you in? [SOLDIER] Poontang. [NORMAL] Thank you, Roosevelt. What's the weather like out there? [SOLDIER] It's hot, damn hot, real hot. Hotter things is my shorts. I could cook things in it. Crotch-pot cooking. [NORMAL] Tell me what it feels like. [SOLDIER] Fool, it's hot. Were you born on the sun? It's damn hot. You can be a little... I saw... It's so damn hot. I saw one of those guys, their orange robes, burst into flames. It's that hot. You know? [NORMAL] What's it gonna be like tonight? [SOLDIER] Hot and wet. That's nice if you're with a lady, ain't no good if you're in the jungle. [NORMAL] Here's a song coming your way right now. "Nowhere to Run To" by Martha and the Vandellas. Yes. Hey, you know what I mean. ["NOWHERE TO RUN TO" PLAYING] Too much? Thank you, Marty. "Silky smooth sounds," get out of here. [CHANTING INDISTINCTLY] That is not what we program here. CRONAUER [ON RADIO]: This is AFVN, rocking you from the Delta to the DMZ. AFVN better than AFVD, which means you have to get a quick shot. We're moving on right now. ["I GET AROUND" PLAYING ON RADIO] CRONAUER: Here's a riddle for you. What's the difference between the Army and the Cub Scouts? Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery. CRONAUER: Hey, I'm Adrian Cronauer. I'm on again at 1600. Why? Because I have to, it's the Army. Talking out in the field today. Hi, what's your name? [SHOUTS] Bob Fliber! [NORMAL] Bob, what do you do? [SHOUTS] I'm in Artillery! [NORMAL] Bob, can we play anything for you? [SHOUTS] Anything! Just play it loud, okay? CRONAUER: I have to admit something to you. I just came from Crete with women that look like Zorba. Whoo! Thank you. Those... [AS GOMER PYLE] Those girls are just so pretty. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Are you in Vietnam? [AS GOMER PYLE] Yes, I am. Surprise, surprise, surprise. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Why'd you name your daughter Linda Bird? [AS LYNDON JOHNSON] Linda Dog would be too cruel. Arf! Easy, girl, easy. Pick them up by their ears, it doesn't hurt them as much. [AS GOMER PYLE] Oh, you're going to hell for that one. CRONAUER [IN NORMAL VOICE]: Here's a coincidence: Ho Chi Minh, Colonel Sanders, actually the same person? You be the judge, our lines are open. We've got our traffic report up there on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. How's it going up there? Adrian, it's not going exactly well. There's a water buffalo jackknifed up there. It's not a very pretty picture. There's horns everywhere. I don't know what to say. We're gonna maybe drop in a little napalm and try and cook him down, maybe a little barbecue. ["GAME OF LOVE" PLAYING ON RADIO] CRONAUER: We've got a special man in the audience today, it's Mr. Leo. He's a fashion consultant for the Army. [EFFEMINATELY] Adiran, I'm just very happy to be here. I want to tell you something. You know, this whole camouflage thing for me doesn't work very well. [NORMAL] Why is that? [EFFEMINATELY] Well, I can't see you. Heh, heh. You know, it's like wearing stripes and plaid. For me, I want to do something different. You go in the jungle, make a statement. If you're going to fight, clash. You know what I mean? [AS LAWRENCE WELK] Thank you for that lovely tune. That funky music will drive us till the dawn. Let's go. Let's boogaloo till we puke. [IN NORMAL VOICE] That's it for the Adrian Cron-Hour. I'm gonna take myself out of the driver's seat, but I'm gonna turn you over right now to Mr. Excitement. A man with limp, damaged hair, but nevertheless a fireball. Dan Levitan. This is AFRS, Radio Saigon, and yours truly, Dan "The Man" Levitan. Greetings and salutations to any and all servicemen in the area and thanks so much for joining us. [ALL CHEERING] - All right! Yeah! Yeah! - Ladies and gentlemen! Yeah, he's funny. I know funny and this guy is funny. Sensational. - At ease. - Hell, we already are. Just cool your tongue, airman, because I intend to take issue with your performance. First of all, don't make fun of the weather here. And don't say that the weather is the same all the time here, because it's not. In fact, it's 2 degrees cooler today than yesterday. Two degrees cooler? Me without my muff, God. [DREIWITZ LAUGHS] DREIWITZ: I tell you, this guy's funny. - I'm trying to run a meeting here. You know, I hate the fact that you people never salute me. I am a lieutenant and I would like salutes occasionally. That's what being a higher rank is all about. Second... Second... - Programming taste. - Programming taste. Frankly, I found your "I love a police action" remark way out of line. How can you have the gall to compare the conflict here in Vietnam with a glass of cappuccino coffee? Well, I was... It just comes up, I was just trying to be funny. - Funny is good. - Yeah. Funny is good. But then do it by using comedy and humour. Not police action and coffee remarks. Furthermore, you are to stick to playing normal modes of music. Not wild stuff. Those we would find acceptable here would include Lawrence Welk, Jim Nabors, Mantovani. Percy Faith. - Percy Faith, good. - Thank you. Andy Williams, Perry Como and certain ballads by Mr. Frank Sinatra. - Would Bob Dylan be out of line? - Way, way, way out of line. Former VP Richard Nixon will arrive here this week. Dreiwitz, I've assigned you to cover the PC. He likes to say PC instead of press conference. - The lieutenant loves to abbreviate... - And if you do... And if you do happen to speak with him, please be polite and to the point at all times. Affirmative, sir. Affirmative, sir. Good. Okay. Who do we have slated for live entertainment in November? Well, we originally wanted Bob Hope, but turns out he won't come. Why not? He doesn't play police actions, just wars. Bob likes a big room, sir. [ALL LAUGH] - That is not funny. - How about if it escalated? - How about if what escalated? - The Vietnam conflict. The Vietnam conflict? We are not going to escalate a whole war just so we can book a big-name comedian. We can get Tony Bennett or Trini Lopez. I got it. Jerry Vale. He closes the Copa on the 18th. - Is that date firm? - I got it from my niece. Come on, this is not the Catskills. Get somebody good, The Beach Boys. Don't dick around. We tried, but their agent says they're still on the beach and they won't be off the sand till November. Ha-ha-ha! Bada-bing! Well, didn't somebody wearing my uniform and bearing a striking resemblance to myself just say that that kind of music was inappropriate? Sorry, sir. I haven't been to sleep. - The former VP will be here on Friday. GARLICK: Ha-ha-ha. I expect every minute of the VP's PC to be taped and broadcast within 12 hours of his arrival. Something funny, Garlick? Perhaps you'd like to share it with the rest of us. No, sir. The former vice president is a delight, sir. Excuse me, sir. Seeing as how the VP is such a VIP, shouldn't we keep the PC on the q.t., because if it leaks to the VC, he could end up an MIA, and then we'd all be put on KP. - I would like to leave the room now. - Oh, uh, yes, sir. [ALL LAUGHING] KIRK: Oh, what a dude. [DREIWITZ AS HAUK] And if you do... [ALL AS HAUK] And if you do... Eddie Kirk here, and Ray Conniff jubilee coming up in just a few moments. I call it a jubilee. Actually, it's a Ray Conniff featurette. Three, maybe four, back-to-back Ray Conniff classics. GARLICK: We're here, sir. Jimmy Wah's. This is the place where we like to hang out, sir. CRONAUER: Real homey, in an opium kind of way. - Earl, Earl, Earl. - That's Jimmy Wah, he owns the place. Hi, hi, hi. Now you say hi to me, then you smile. [IN UNISON] Hi. Hey, you two Earl. What about couple beer? We'd love a couple of beers, Jimmy. CRONAUER: Either of our names Earl? - He calls everybody Earl. Is it me or is Jimmy light in the loafers? Let me put it to you this way. He's got this thing for Walter Brennan. He says he wants to buy naked photographs of the actor. - For three years, he's been trying. - Walter Brennan? You know, Walter Brennan from The Real McCoys, the TV show? [AS WALTER BRENNAN] Well, well, well, Luke. Well, well. Anyway, there's this guy from the 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry, who swore that he could get him naked photographs of the actor. I've been trying to tell him that it's no-go, but he won't listen. God. Nude photographs of Walter Brennan. Here your beer. - Thank you, Jimmy. - Right. Any movement on the Walter Brennan thing? - No, and it doesn't look good, Jimmy. - He look good to me. - Ba Muy Ba beer, best beer in Vietnam. - Ba Muy Ba beer, only beer in Vietnam. Try it. - Oh, what happened? - What happened? - Formaldehyde. - Oh. Heh, heh. We put in just a touch of formaldehyde for flavour. Some people get sick, yeah. So if you have to be rushed to a hospital, then when you return, I give you a free salad. Well, that seems fair. It really does. - You'll get used to it. - Maybe. There she is. Any girl who wants me this bad, I can't let her down. - The hunt is on. - What is wrong? - I gotta catch her before she accelerates. WAH: You can't go yet. - You have to taste my spicy chicken... GARLICK: Sir. ...cooked with... Hi. How's Lynn doing? I'm sorry. You look like Lynn's friend from Toledo. Let me make it up to you by buying a cup of coffee. Also, tea would fall into that category. I not think be not correct of way. Please, okay? - What'd she just say? - She said no, sir. CRONAUER: Oh, Edward, I'm in love. Think she likes seafood? I'm... She's getting away. Edward, get the jeep, get the jeep. Okay. It's blocked in by a truck. Stay here, sir, I'll talk to the guys, okay? We don't have time. Taxi. - Bikes, we'll buy bikes. - We won't buy bikes. There's actually no rubber on these tyres. Oh, picky, picky. Let's go, Edward. Yeah, the chase. [BICYCLE BELL RINGING] Sir! Sir, we have to get some dignity here. A little dignity! Sir! Sir, I tell you, this is not safe! Sir! Sir, sir! [TRUCK HORN HONKING] - Good afternoon, class. STUDENTS: Good afternoon, Mr. Sloan. SLOAN: Last time, in our last class, we read Chapter 3. Should've gotten the one with the training wheels, pal. I was almost killed. A truck's bumper was this far from my nose. My whole life passed before my eyes, and it wasn't even interesting to me. How am I gonna get to first base with this girl? SLOAN: I want to buy some butter and some cheese, please. It zoomed right by, just the way they say it does. Stamp collections, pulling chickweed from my dad's dichondra plants. Arranging rakes by sizes for my mom in the garage. Even encapsulated in two seconds, my life is dull. - I find that very alarming. - Edward, stay with me on this. How am I gonna get this girl to go out with me? You're not. This is a very different culture. You would need very specific family-sanctioned introductions - in order to talk to this girl... CRONAUER: Shh! Listen. - It read for my the book. - I've never heard rhymes like that. God, I've gotta be with her, at least till she learns my name. You think the teacher would be able to date her? - Possibly, but you would need... - Just what I wanted to hear. ...specific introductions. SLOAN: What we're gonna talk about today is shopping. Shopping for dinner and the things you buy during, uh... In your shopping trip. Specifically... Excuse me. Can I help you? Yes, I have two months to live and I would like to teach before I die. I don't think you understand me, Sparky. Ahem. It's all yours, you got it. Hello, class. My name is Adrian Cronauer. And I'd like to get to know all of you by having you write down your name, address, your home and work phone on paper, and passing it forward. Sergeant Sloan our teacher. You're not supposed to be in here. I was sent here on very strict orders from a colonel. First thing I'd like to know is what subject this is. - Is it English? CRONAUER: Yes, it is. And how lucky for me. Thank you very much for playing. Now, let's start off with the fact that English is a fantastic language. Let's try a little phrase, uh, I like to call: "My boyfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble. Hey, nah, hey, nah, my boyfriend's back." Can we try that one? Can we try, "My boyfriend's back"? Anybody? She's not for you. Why do I feel like the miracle worker up here? [MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY AS HELEN KELLER] GARLICK: This is a nightmare. CRONAUER: I don't know. Even saying that means I don't know dick. I can't really teach English. Didn't have to pick up the phones until he comes back. I can only tell you about how you can talk on maybe the real streets of America. If you're walking on the streets of New York and someone says, [FLATLY] "Hey, excuse me. I would like to buy some cheese and some butter." [IN NORMAL VOICE] No. No, come on. Basically, we talk, "Hey, man, what's happening? You look hip today. Slip me some skin." If someone in America comes up and says, "Slip me some skin," don't be afraid. They're not a leper, they're not gonna go: No, it means like, "Hey, baby, slip me some skin." It's a greeting. It's like, "How are you doing? Slip me some skin." Here's how you do it, "Slip me some skin." Put your hand out there. Then you go. "Yeah, there's some skin." Now you do it to me. Yeah, now, then you say, "Groovy, yeah." Say that. MAN: Groovy. - Yes. [STUDENTS LAUGH] Baby. If something's really nice, you say it's groovy. Doesn't mean you're like going: No, it means groovy. Try that one. Say, "Hey, baby, what's happening? Let's groove." Hey, baby, what's happening? Let's groove. [BELL RINGS] - See you later. - Mr. Cronauer, I really liking you. - Well, I'm liking you too. - Thank you. - You teach American thing okay. CRONAUER: Okay. WILKIE: Play game of softball. Okay, yeah, well, we'll try and do that if we get the equipment. - You forget the girl. - Oh, I'll let her say no. She's say no. That's what walking away from you means. I'm interested in the girl, not in you playing "Dear Abby." I know because she's my sister. I would, however, love to buy you lunch, maybe look at a family album. - Come on. - I not like you, sir. Why not? I got a great personality, you ask anybody. You phoney, like American and French before you. Here to get something, leaving when you not get it. You come into my class, so maybe we like you. You come for the girl, you get her, you go. Okay, Sherlock, yeah, I bribed my way to meet the girl. You got me, bang. But, hey, I like the class, so I'm gonna stay. Let's be friends, okay? Come on. - Come on, come on. - You like me because of my sister. No, I like you because you're honest. Because you're shorter than I am. We look like a before and after picture. Come on, let me buy you a beer. Sometimes your face look like a fish in the Gulf of Thailand. That's true, it's very true. That's an insult, isn't it? TUAN: You can buy me lunch, but please forget about my sister. I know Americans. You see a girl with the type breasts they like and they put her in a fancy car, and they buy her some expensive food, and then lie about money. And then try and take her into a bed. CRONAUER: So, what's wrong with that? TUAN: It's more devout here. CRONAUER: Any food on this street that doesn't give you diarrhoea? TUAN: You wanting some? What the hell is this? Oh, she pour nuoc mam noodle soup with fish ball. Didn't know they had balls. Eat. Eat. I can't, it's still paddling. No, it okay. I not tell you okay otherwise. You like it. You see? You don't trusting me. I trust you, man, it's just that I can't eat something that looks like a cesspool. You mad I not trust you, but true, you not trust me. You want be my friend, you trusting me. You would eat it. Hey, I'll be... I wanna be your pal. Here, okay, I'll eat it. Dig in. Mm-mm. Jeez! Shit! God. Oh, hot. My... Ow. Shit. This stuff is burning the hair off my feet. Hot? No, hot? No, it's fucking great. [COUGHS] - She say it's a little spicy. - A little, yeah. Isn't that funny? You like that too? A little of this: whoo-whoo-whoo. She likes the Three Stooges. [AS CURLY] Hey, Moe, hey, Moe. Oh, me like that you're silly. - You old enough for this place? - I think so. Hi, Earl, good to see you again. - Look at the new friend. - A little too young for you. I want to show you something very nice. - Oh, really? - It look wonderful. - I can confide you? - Sure. Look at the shape of that soldier ankle, the way it so elegantly curve into his boot. Help me get some photo of those ankle, I give you my bar. You're a very sick man. You know that, don't you? Thank you. Oh, God. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the new voice of Saigon, Adrian Cronauer. Cronauer! Not enough for the car, yeah. - What happened? CRONAUER: It didn't work out. I wanna introduce you to someone right now from my English class. This is Tuan, the guys. - Hey, Tuan. - How you doing? - Guys, Tuan. - Have a seat, man. Pull up a floor here. Hi, Tuan, long time no see. - Terrible, that's terrible. - Those are gorgeous gals. I've... I'll never have them. I've wanted girls like that, but I've had trouble as a young child. Who the hell gets laid as a young child? And stop calling them gals. Cowgirls are called gals. Those are gorgeous French-Vietnamese B-girls. Don't ruin it by conjuring up images of Dale Evans, all right? Can you believe the shape of those gals? Girls. Shape of the blue. No, those behinds were designed by a Jewish scientist in Switzerland, Dr. Feintush. Dr. Heimlich Feintush. We're trying to meet them, but nobody can come up with any good lines. Wait a minute, try this one, try this one. Oh, girls, girls, come on over. Your loss. Pardon me, girls? Excuse me, girls. Hello, hello. Come on, yes. [SINGING] Here she comes, Miss Southeast Asia Say, we're not supposed to fraternise with these girls. It says so in the memo. No fraternising with these girls in the memo. Forget memos, forget memos. These are pretty women coming. CRONAUER [SINGING]: Here she comes KIRK: It's working. McPHERSON: Oh, yeah, this way, please. CRONAUER: Thank you. - Hey. - Hello, I'm William Holden. KIRK: Right here. This way, this way. CRONAUER: Merry Christmas. McPHERSON: Bingo. CRONAUER: Merry Christmas. If you believe in Santa... How come I don't get one? Dan Levitan. You've probably heard my radio show. WOMAN: Hi. LEVITAN: What's your name? LEVITAN: My name is Levitan. Can you say that? SERGEANT: Who brought in the gook? LEVITAN: Levitan. WOMAN: Levitan. I said, who brought in the fucking gook? WOMAN: Levitan. WOMAN: I love you. CRONAUER: A khaki eclipse. TUAN: I better go now. That's all right. I did. Hey, come on now, if you kick out the gooks, you have to kick out the Chinks, spics, spooks and kikes, and all that's gonna be left in here are a couple of brain-dead rednecks, and what fun would that be? Now is when I stop talking. Come on, let me buy you a couple of beers. How about it? - Are you crazy? - I might... - Shut up. - Okay. SERGEANT: Get him out of here. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, come on now. You gotta prove something, knocking around Vietnamese kids? This is a GI bar. We don't like gooks. We don't want him here. You just get him out. Everybody say "gook," but it's all right. - Jump in any time, okay? - We're there. I gotta tell you something, you know. I've been all around the world, seen a lot of places and a lot of people. I have never ever, in my travels, come across a man as large as you with as much muscles, who has absolutely no penis. He mean that as compliment. Oh, shit. That's it for you, asshole. Call police, quick. MAN 1: Hey, hey, man, hey! MAN 2: Get him. Talk. These two were physically abusing a Vietnamese national. - I thought since we were here to... - So you start a brawl. Turn the place upside down. Real intelligent solution. Do you have any idea how ridiculous it makes me look to have a man under my command start a fucking bar brawl? - You're not gonna last long here, pal. - You can always send me back to Crete. Oh, you think this is a joke? I can come up with alternatives other than Crete. I'm real good at stuff like that. I got people stuck in places they haven't even considered how to get out of yet. You don't think I can come up with something good? Can you envision some fairly unattractive alternatives? Not without slides. A bar brawl, that's one, Cronauer. You better stay cool. You better not get involved in anything. You better not even come within range of anything that happens, or your ass is grass and I'm a lawnmower. - Am I being fairly clear? - Yes, sir. Sir? Do you see anything on this uniform indicating an officer? What does three up and three down mean to you, airman? End of an inning. Sergeant major. Now, you get the hell out of here right now. [DREIWITZ SCATTING REVEILLE] CRONAUER: Jesus, enough. Please, I'm... Bag it! Wake up, Mr. Sleepy Head. You are late. Gentlemen, what can I say but hi. - Hi. - Hi. Okay, which one of you guys is throwing his voice? Oh, censor, censor, censor. Join the Army and mark things. Hey, what kind of news are you leaving me there? "Nixon, Singapore, Lake Erie." Come on. Come on, you're on in like two seconds. It's time for Adrian Cronauer. [YELLS] Good morning, Vietnam. Hello, campers. Remember, Monday is malaria day. Time to take that big orange pill and get ready for the Ho Chi Minh two-step. We're back. Here's the news. All the news that's new and approved by the U.S. Army, the sweetest-smelling army in the world. [MIMICS TELETYPE MACHINE] "Great Britain recognised the island state of Singapore." How do you recognise an island? You go, "Hey, wait. No, don't tell me, wait, wait. Didn't we meet last year at the Feinman bar mitzvah? You look a lot like Hawaii. Didn't we meet last year at the Peninsula Club?" No. "Pope Paul VI celebrated a Mass in Italian." Call me crazy, he's in Rome. I wanna kiss his ring and have it go: [WHISTLES] "The Mississippi River broke through a protective dike today." What is a protective dike? A woman by the river going, [IN DEEP VOICE] "Don't go near there"? Don't go near there. Get away from the river, stay away. [NORMAL] I know we can't use "dyke." You can't even say "lesbian." It's "women in comfortable shoes." Thank you. Here's the weather. We're gonna go to Roosevelt E. Roosevelt. Roosevelt, how's it going? [SOLDIER] I'm with somebody. Don't come bother me right now. [NORMAL] Can't you give us weather? [SOLDIER] Not now. I'm trying to score, back off. [NORMAL] What's the weather like? [SOLDIER] You got a window. [NORMAL] We'll go to someone else for the weather. We have to go to Washington to Weather Central to Walter Cronkite. Walter, what's the weather like? [AS WALTER CRONKITE] I want to begin by saying to Roosevelt E. Roosevelt, what it is, what it shall be, what it was. Weather out there today is hot and shitty with continued hot and shitty in the afternoon. Tomorrow a chance of continued crappy with a pissy weather front coming down from the north. CRONAUER: Basically, it's hotter than a snake's ass in a waggon round up. [IN NORMAL VOICE] We're gonna hit some songs at you now. Coming your way. What the hell was that? Crappy weather, shitty weather? - Comedy, sir. - Comedy? No, no. This is not comedy. Comedy is fun. - It's antics, hysterical-type things. - Hysterical-type things? Airman Cronauer requesting you to elaborate. Antics, damn it. Comedy of errors, like the Keystone Kops falling down. - General wackiness like that. - Falling down, that's a sight gag. - How would anyone see you fall? - No, no, no. Not literally falling down. McPHERSON: Wouldn't work on radio, sir. - See, sir? What I mean is in the spirit of the Keystone Kops. Sir, it wouldn't work, I don't think. I don't think anybody would see you fall through a radio, sir. If a field radio... What are you doing here? - I thought I'd come and help smooth... - Don't help and don't smooth. And you. You are not funny. But you are a maniac, and you'd better start changing your life. CRONAUER: Sir? Thank you for that constructive criticism. It's a privilege to take comedy notes from a man of your stature. Fine. Just don't let it happen again. [SIGHS] In the dictionary, under "asshole," it says, "See him." Why am I here? We're gonna play some music for you right now. Here we go. Here's a little James Brown coming your way. Baby, help me, please. ["I GOT YOU (I FEEL GOOD)" PLAYING ON RADIO] [SCREAMS] [AS JAMES BROWN] Back again. [LAUGHS] Sugar and spice. Ha, ha. So nice, so good. [SCREAMS] Tell them, James. Hurt them now. Ha, ha. Good God, help me. Work through it. Oh, sir, Walter Cronkite lives in New Jersey. - It was a joke, sir. - Yes. - Sarcasm, sir. - Up in Bergen County. KIRK: A form of humour, sir. LEVITAN: Hackensack. KIRK: Yes, sir. LEVITAN: How the hell do I know? KIRK: We're happy with him too, sir. Yes, I'm sure that wasn't Walter Cronkite. KIRK: I will tell him, sir. - Didn't I speak to you before? Okay, sir, thank you. CRONAUER: Very good. All right, now. All right, let's recap now, okay. If someone is not telling the truth, you say that they are full of... STUDENTS [IN UNISON]: Shit. MAN: Shit. Okay, if someone is making you angrier and angrier, therefore, you have... STUDENTS [IN UNISON]: Pissed me off. MAN: Pissed me off. Okay, join the others if you can. All right, let's see. If you say that, hey, some people in a car, some gypsies, they cut you off. All of a sudden you... STUDENTS: Flip them the bird. - A bird. Very good. Okay, now we got a special situation right now. There's a Puerto Rican waitress. She comes over, brings you a red soup. She's got some tomato soup. Oh, she slips, she spills it on your brand-new gabardine pants that you paid more than a coloured TV for. You're a little angry, so you say to her... Minh? Uh, look what you did. And goddamn it and stupid and crap. That's stupid, you don't call someone crap. No, you step on crap. You don't call it to a person. You can step on crap. I know you can. Yes, but they can be full of shit, he said. No, no, you see, you step in shit, you can be full of crap. I'm pretty sure you can step on crap. I once saw it in a French movie. How can some person look like a shit? - It impossible. CRONAUER: Let's stop with that. We can stop with the debate on the great caca right now. Let's try a very special situation. Wilkie, something special, okay? You go into a restaurant, okay? A waitress comes up to you. You're wearing your best new suit. She comes up, she spills soup all over you, looks at you like, "I'm sorry. What're you gonna do about it, asshole?" What do you say to her? What would you say? They spilled something on your pants, what would you do? I do nothing. Come on, Wilkie, it's cursing class. You're getting pissed off. What would you do? I just remain reticent. Okay, she goes in the kitchen, she gets a knife, she starts stabbing you. She's stabbing you. She's putting forks in you. She's got spoons in your eyes, Will. They're starting to cut you with knives, putting spoons in your eyes. What would you do, Will? What would you do? I'm waiting to die. Mr. Cronauer, we like your lessons better than the book's. - Soon we play baseball? - When you teaching us softball? We have to have training. When I think you're ready, I'll try. - Where are you come from? - Queens. Bayside, Queens. - What are queens? - Tall, thin men who like show tunes. No? Big men with moustaches named Mary who wear mascara. [SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE] Yeah. [SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE] What is a lakai? Relax already, crazy American. I made a date with you and Trinh tomorrow. - You did? - Nearby the larch tree, near Viet Hoa. By the food and flower vendors where you burn your mouth on the noodles. - Where's that? - The noodles, remember? - When you burn your mouth. - Oh, gosh, yeah. But I warn you, you not like it when you get there. You say it ridiculous. Why? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Hi. Hi. Oh, God, this could be very ugly. Hi. Chaperons. In Vietnam, family often come to meet someone, to meet someone. Hello, hey. Well, the gang's all here, huh? Ha, ha. Oh, God, help me. This is wonderful. Well, you know, you're very beautiful. And you're also very quiet. And I'm not used to girls being that quiet unless they're medicated. I go out with girls who talk so much you can hook them up to a wind turbine and they could power a small New Hampshire town. You talk, I think, very much. Well, you see, I'm not used to going on a date with a grand jury, and it makes me a little nervous. I don't want makes you nervous, Cronauer. I know you very nice. And for trusting, you is the best of the gently of what you say of never to be for both the same and another. Well, I had you there, babe, but then you lost me at the end. Hey, hey. Hey, Uncle Phil. Here you go, there you go. Hey, got one? For you. Hey, there we go, for you. Here we go, for you all. Knock yourselves out. What's one-thirteenth of a dollar among friends? Come on. No problem. They're having a great... Hey, listen, I know there's no way. But it doesn't mean we can't have a few laughs. Hey, I'll take whatever you can give because I'm just happy to be with you. You want to see a movie or something? - We must to ask the people. - Hey, it's no problem. Attention, shoppers. People, people, settle. CRONAUER: "Under the Boardwalk," you know that one? "Shout" by the Isley Brothers, you know that? - You know any American songs at all? - "Puff the Magic Dragon." You know "Puff the Magic Dragon"? Will you sing it? [SINGING] Puff, the Magic Dragon Living by the tree That's wonderful. Hey, 12, please. Um... [BOTH SPEAK IN VIETNAMESE] [SINGING ""BEACH BLANKET BINGO"] [DUBBED IN VIETNAMESE] [SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE] My thoughts exactly. Why can't I read this? It's what's going on here now. They'd never approve of that being released. That's censorship, Edward. That's not what America's all about. We're not in America, sir. Can we please not get into this right now? You're in the middle of a show. You could put amphetamine freaks to sleep with this shit. "Got an agreement on Guam." Sounds like bird droppings. Here's something exciting: "Hubert Humphrey visits Capitol Hill." A children's story. - I'm reading this. - No, I can't let you do that. Edward, don't you ever do anything that's not by the book? Not when I get into trouble. No, I don't. Eddie, sometimes you got to go out of your way to get into trouble. It's called fun. What's that? Come on. Take some chances once in a while, Edward. That's what life's all about. - Find anything? - No, I'll have to make something up. Hey, we're back. That last two seconds of silence was Marcel Marceau's newest single: "Walkin' in the Wind." And now here are the headlines. [MIMICS TELETYPE MACHINE] Here they come at you right now. Pope actually found to be Jewish, Liberace is Anastasia, and Ethel Merman jams Russian radar. The East Germans today claimed that the Berlin Wall was a fraternity prank. Also, the pope decided today to release Vatican-related bath products. An incredible thing. Yes, it's the new Pope-on-a-Rope. That's right, Pope-on-a-Rope. Wash with it, go straight to heaven. Thank you. Ethel Merman today uses a test to jam Russian radar. Here's a brief test of that jamming. [SINGING AS ETHEL MERMAN] Oh, I've got a feeling That love is here to stay When asked for a reply, the Russians went, [IN RUSSIAN ACCENT] "What the hell was that?" [MIMICS TELETYPE MACHINE] [IN NORMAL VOICE] Here's a news flash: Today, President Lyndon Johnson passed a highway beautification bill. The bill basically said that his daughters could not drive in a convertible on highways. Hey, we got a great show coming your way today. Former Vice President Richard Nixon's in town. That's right, the big Dick is here. Get ready. I think there's an incredible coincidence here. I think he sounds exactly like Mister Ed. You be the judge. [AS NIXON] I tell you this. [NORMAL] Now, listen. [AS MISTER ED] Wilbur, come in the room. An incredible coincidence, some more songs. Moving on, moving on into the dawn with the dawn-busters, yeah. ["IT'S ALL RIGHT" PLAYING ON RADIO] The requests will be taken pretty soon. Requests? Where am I gonna take requests? Where can you call from? [SOLDIER] I'm in a phone booth out in the DMZ. I'm trying to call you right now. [IN VIETNAMESE ACCENT] Lock 'n' loll, baby. Lock 'n' loll. Vee. Again, we've got our friend from military intelligence. Can you tell us what you've found out about the enemy since you've been here? [SLOWLY] We found out that we can't find them. They're out there, and we're having a major difficulty in finding the enemy. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Well, what do you use to look for them? [SLOWLY] Well, we ask people, "Are you the enemy?" And whoever says yes, we shoot them. It's very difficult to find a Vietnamese man named Charlie. They're all named Nyugen or Doh or things like that. It's very difficult for me. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Thank you. Is it true that you've actually...? You're actually too close to some of the nerve agents they were testing? [SLOWLY] Nerve gas? [IN NORMAL VOICE] Yes, have you used any? [SLOWLY] Well, once, yes, on myself. And it had no... [SCREAMS] ...no effect on me. I've had no actual... [SCREAMS THEN SPEAKS GIBBERISH] Whoa, big dogs. Big dogs landing on my face. I don't know what that means. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Hey, that's it for me. That's the end of the Adrian Cron-Hour, but I'm gonna turn you over right now to Mr. Warmth, Dan "The Tan" Levitan. Ha, ha. Thank you so much, Adrian. Adrian Cronauer, GIs, a wacky and welcome addition... Nixon's press conference. Well, wait till you hear it. He's this far from sincerity. Oh, no, man, listen. Let me just feed my face. Just a moment, come on. - Where do you imagine you're going? - Just gonna get a little something to eat. You don't have time. You'll stay here and drink instant beverage or something. We promised our listening audience Nixon highlights by 4 p.m. I've been on the air for four hours. I'm hungry. That's a joke, right? I get it. No, I'm actually hungry. Well, I'm actually giving you an order. Oh, it's an order. In that case, gentlemen, let's edit. Thank you. Mm-mm. Campbell's. Aha! Earl, oh, you again. No more fighting, okay? Oh, you got it. James, nice, shiny green suit. You look like an Oriental leprechaun. You like it? I got it in Hong Kong, home of the shiny green suit. NIXON [OVER RADIO]: There is no place for neutrality or a neutralist sentiment in South Vietnam. As I leave Vietnam today there is no doubt, certainly, in my mind... Hey. That's Nixon. NIXON [ON RADIO]: --whether the Vietcong will be defeated, NIXON [ON TAPE]: and that this war will be won. Mission does involve... I think very appropriately. ...as you have suggested, give and take. CRONAUER [ON TAPE]: Well, I didn't make that suggestion, sir. NIXON [ON RADIO]: The United States has no right to give. Why would Cronauer's voice be on this tape? I don't know, lieutenant. NIXON: --territory to the Communists. CRONAUER: Thank you for that concise political commentary, but I'd like to delve into something slightly more personal for the men in the field. How would you describe your testicles? NIXON: They're soft, they're shallow - and they have no purpose. - Oh, my God. CRONAUER: What, sir? - Oh, my God. NIXON: They lack the physical strength. CRONAUER: How would you describe your sex life with your wife, Pat? NIXON [ON RADIO]: It is unexciting sometimes. CRONAUER: Have you considered a sex change? There is an operation that... Please don't do this to me. Please don't do this. CRONAUER: --a very well-hung Chihuahua. Mr. Nixon, while you've been in Vietnam, it's rumoured that you smoked marijuana. Are you planning, sir, to take some of the marijuana back to the United States? How would you do that? NIXON [ON TAPE]: By plane, by helicopter and also by automobile. CRONAUER: I was wondering if you could do your Mister Ed, because... Cut that thing off. I said cut it off. GARLICK: Sir. - Where is Cronauer? DREIWITZ: Still eating, sir. I want to see him ASAP. What, sir? - As soon as possible. - VG, sir. We interrupt to bring you an emergency selection of the Benny Goodman Orchestra. HAUK: We simply need to consider taking him off the air. TAYLOR: Lieutenant, we get hundreds, maybe thousands of calls and letters each week, fan mail. He's the first man in the history of Armed Forces Radio to get fan mail. Every GI in this country is glued to his radio twice a day at 0600 hours and 1600 hours to hear that lunatic. Sir, the man has got an irreverent tendency. He did a very off-colour parody of former VP Nixon. I thought it was hilarious. Respectfully, sir, the former VP is a good man and a decent man. Bullshit. I know Nixon personally. He lugs a train load of shit behind him that would fertilise the Sinai. I wouldn't buy an apple from the son of a bitch, and I consider him a good, close personal friend. Let's get down to business here, general. What is going on here? We've got a mounting crisis in this country. We've got a deejay that the men dearly love. If you two have personal problems, solve them, will you? Thank you, lieutenant. Thank you, lieutenant. Speak your piece, Dick. Due respect, sir. I have over 15 years command experience in this Army. Do you really expect me to run this radio station with nothing to say and no way to do it? Right now, yes. Yes, sir. DICKERSON: This is not over yet. Why you still here? Sparky. Sitting back, having a cup of formaldehyde. You say after you go out with Trinh, you meet me to talk about her. - Nothing to discuss, she doesn't like me. - Yes, she do. - No, she don't. - She do liking you. She want to meet you today. She's not far from here. - I can't, I gotta be back on the air... - You have to meet her today. - Otherwise, you miss your big chance. - I don't wanna miss my big chance. Yes, come, we go. Sound like you learned English from Tonto. "We go." TUAN: Come on. - Okay. I still can't believe she really wants to see me. Yeah. I guess that beach movie really impressed her, huh? I gotta get her something. - What about bananas? - No. No, that doesn't say the right thing. You're right. How about...? [WOMAN SCREAMING] MAN: Oh, my God! [SIREN WAILING] [WOMAN CRYING] God! [SOLDIER BLOWS WHISTLE] DISPATCHER [OVER RADIO]: Four-twenty-seven as far as... Oh, my bar! Why? Who do that? MP 1: Get back. MP 2: Dead. CRONAUER: You can't just leave them. - This boy's gone, soldier. MAN: Let's go. MP 1: Come on, get back. Get back. DISPATCHER [OVER RADIO]: Fire 4, there's a fire in the landing on the outside of the building. Hey, where's he going? What do you think you're doing? You're forbidden to read anything not checked. - What? I was there. - Airman, you know the rules. If this is legitimate, it must go through proper channels. Listen, it's an actual event. Where do you think this came from? I just wanna report the truth. It'd be a nice change of pace. - What's going on here? - Sir, will you listen to me? Not official news. Far as I'm concerned, it didn't happen. - It did happen... - You shut your mouth. What are you afraid of? People might find out there's a war? This news is not official, airman. You want everyone going under the assumption it's safe here. It's not. The fighting's not in the hills. It's downtown... I said it is none of your goddamn business. I see your point. I'm sorry. I guess I get inside, hit these air conditioners. I get a little dizzy. Thanks for setting me straight. It'll be okay. DREIWITZ: --coming up at the top of the hour. That about wraps it up for me, Marty Lee, filling in for my buddy, vacationing Eddie Kirk, who, despite all your requests, will return tomorrow. Right now, it's once again time for the King Kong of Saigon, Adrian Cronauer. [YELLS] Good morning, Vietnam. Hey, I know it's not the morning, but that's my trademark and "good evening" sounds too depressing. Hey, we're going right now to the news. [MIMICS TELETYPE MACHINE] From England, today, Princess Margaret threw a shoe. Easy, Madge. Also Elizab... Queen Elizabeth, Liz... Elizabeth Taylor. Elizabeth Taylor. She's still married after six months. Way to go, Liz, hey. All right, in Saigon today, according to official sources, nothing actually happened. One thing that didn't officially happen was a bomb didn't explode at 1430 hours, unofficially destroying Jimmy Wah's Café. - Get him out of there. - Three men were unofficially wounded. And two men whose identities are still not known were unofficially dead. - Break the goddamn door down. CRONAUER: Police, ambulance and fire department responded at what's believed to be unofficial at this present moment. Turn the power off in that studio. McPHERSON: It's... - Turn it off now. I just wanted to think that you should... DICKERSON: The man should be court-martialled. You think this is the most serious set of affairs I have to address? It's not. I can't believe you're gonna pass on this. The man is to be a great ruler someday. Isn't that enough? I hope I will be, but I meant a real skill. One that I didn't inherit, wasn't given to me and-and can't be taken away. My brother-- my half-brother, Bash-- he has so many. He wants to learn something, he does, he wants to go somewhere, he goes. With my father's blessing. They don't worry about him dying so much that they don't let him live. Because he'll never be king. I can milk a goat and cut peat for the fire. The nuns, you know. Impressive. I suppose if there was ever an uprising that sent my line into hiding, I could always get by as a blacksmith. But I'd save you. And we could go to Scotland and rule there. That's a... that's a very kind offer. I hope I never have to take you up on it. Natalia. Did anyone see you come in here? No. They never do. They never will. Nothing's changed here. Nothing has to. Stirling, no! Stirling! Come on, boy! Mary. What is it? Um, I brought you something, to decorate your swords with. Now's not a good time. Oh... Next time, you should be announced. My page is there for a reason. I don't understand. You shouldn't be here. Why do you sound so... Are you alone? Are you with someone? If you are ever going to be the Queen of France, you need to understand something. Kings do not answer to their wives. Stirling... No, come back! Stirling! Stirling? Stirling, come back! Go on. Stirling, come back! Mary? Stirling! Mary. - Stirling, come back! - Mary! Stirling! Stirling! Stirling! No, no, wait. Mary. Young girls-- royals, queens-- do not leave the castle alone. But my-my dog... Let him go. Do not go into those woods. Do you hear me? Why not? What's in those woods? Besides my dog, who I might've caught if you hadn't stopped me. He'll find his way back. There's food and warmth. Who wouldn't want to be at the castle? Except, perhaps, you. Rather be at the convent, would you? Eating porridge and trudging through mud? I quite like the way mud feels underfoot. Maybe you'll be sent back to the nuns. For misbehaving. You're cheeky. And you're upset about more than your dog taking a little jaunt into the wild. What is it? You should ask your brother. Ask him what? Why he's such a moody, arrogant ass. We're half-brothers, by the way. Nothing in common but our father, really. Oh. But I'll mention your discontent to Francis. Don't bother. And I'll find your dog. Warm enough? Colin! I don't believe it! What are you doing here? You can't... I've been thinking of you from the moment you got on that boat. I borrowed money and left the next day. I want you to stay, but we'll be found out. We need permission. Oh... What a grand, romantic gesture. And you say your queen, Mary, knows your young man? Uh, she hasn't met Colin, but she knows his people. Oh... Your father is a cousin of Mary's father, James? My father served him until the day King James died. His Grace was generous, he granted my father large holdings, but... we're no relation. You come from former servants... My, what a rise your people have made. I do love a success story. Stay and tell me all about it. Oh, Lola, you should go find Mary, keep her on task so we can all enjoy the wedding. So Bash just happened upon you. You don't believe that. He has a terrible reputation with women, he knows no bounds. Maybe it runs in the family. Did something happen with Francis? No, no, nothing. Really, it's fine, and we need to get ready for the wedding.nothing. So go on... I'll tell the servants you're ready to be bathed and dressed. Thank you. Hello? Is anyone here? Taste of love and sorrow, but don't drink the wine. Don't. Who are you? We're very happy to be back at court. Your Grace. Beautiful evening, is it not? Why aren't you with Colin? What's he doing with Mary? She's his queen. He's just paying his respects. Let's raise a glass. To the happy couple. Hear, hear. ...don't drink the wine. Oh, Lola, no. Aylee, I want to go dance. You can't dance alone. I won't be alone. Lola, come dance with me. Take off you shoes. Come on. Dance with me. Take off you shoes. We're overrun by Scots. Dance with me! Come dance! Look... Elisabeth and Philip are leaving. It's time for the consummation; the ritual, the ceremony, the mystery. Aren't you curious? Shh... We can't actually watch them... you know. It's a tradition for royals. Well, we are not allowed. Don't you want to know what you're in for someday? With your Francis? Pax vobis. In nomini patri et fili et spiritus sancti. Amen. We're the only ones that matter here. Let's go. Come on. Go, before anyone sees us. ♪ Ah, ah, oh-oh, oh-oh ♪ Ah, ah, yo ♪ Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh ♪ Ah, ah, yo ♪ You're the one I follow, follow to the middle ♪ ♪ Middle of the shadows, far away from all the sorrows ♪ ♪ You're the one I follow, follow all the way-oh ♪ ♪ Way into the darkness where the sun is shining yellow...♪ ♪ You're the one I follow, follow all the way-oh ♪ ♪ Way into the darkness where the sun is shining yellow... ♪ Colin? ♪ Nah-nah, nah-nah ♪ Oh, oh, oh, nah-nah ♪ Honestly, honestly ♪ If any disaster needs a remedy ♪ ♪ Remedy, remedy, remedy, remedy ♪ ♪ Following...

There's something I need to say to you. When you came to my room, I-I shouldn't have said what I did. There were other ways of handling this. Handling what? Me? You do realize that we're going to be married someday, don't you? Believe me, I know. I know you had a life before I got here. It's not about that. Don't you think that we owe it to each other, to our families, to our countries, to give it a chance? It's not that simple. Not that simple? ! What's not simple? ! We've been engaged since we were six! It's all arranged. How awful must you find me to do this? It's not you. You're-You're beautiful and clever and unpredictable, but it doesn't matter. What matters is what's right for my country. France is not as strong as you might think, or care, which maybe you don't, but I do. I'm going to be king someday, responsible for my people. And right now, an alliance with Scotland could destroy France. You don't want to marry me. You don't want this at all. Things could change. Well, it isn't your decision, it's your father's. You don't see him pushing a wedding either, do you? All engagements really do is hold alliances. He's betting we might need Scotland, I'm betting we'll find more support elsewhere. I know it's not what you want to hear. But you won't love me. You won't let yourself. Love is irrelevant to people like us. We who are so privileged in so many ways with that. All I'm asking you to do is wait, see how things go. See how things go for France. I guess it is simple after all. But you aren't not the only one with a country to think of. Your Grace, please! Your Grace, please! No! Guards! Colin, no! Forgive me! I...! Come on, Colin... Please, Your Grace, forgive me! Move! I couldn't...! Your Grace, please! Come on! How could this happen? Where were the guards? Why didn't they stop him? I hope Mary did if they didn't. They'll question her virtue. If she's not a virgin, then she'll never be the queen of France, and our chances at court will be over. You don't know what happened, any of you. Tell me. I've spoken to him. He's being held. I bribed a guard. Colin's a good man; a boy still. What did he say? What possible defense could he have given you? He said he was forced. He wouldn't say by whom. He couldn't, he was so afraid. But he said there are people, powerful people, behind this, and he had no choice. What people? Here, in the castle. He wouldn't risk saying more. Do you believe him, Mary? He looked so surprised that I would fight back. That I would even wake. That you'd wake? He attacked you. The wine. I was told not to drink the wine. I was warned. Warned by whom? It doesn't matter now. I believe you. I believe Colin. Please help him. I thank you for your protection last night, but I need to speak with Colin. Speak to your assailant? Why? Because he is the love of my dear friend. And if there was any misunderstanding, if I sent the wrong message in my joy at the wedding... Take care, child. If anyone knew you were even asking this... Catherine, she needs to know. Gossip poisons too. It can poison a young queen's reputation, her heirs' right to the throne, an entire kingdom. You may have behaved foolishly, but you are not responsible for your countryman's actions. Colin McPhail is my subject. I am his queen, and I demand to speak with him. Witnesses have come forward. The boy played a role in an English plot to destroy your engagement and Scotland's alliance with France. An English plot, you're sure? You must know if he'd been successful in his assault, you'd be unfit to marry our son; to marry any royal. My dear, this was not an act of passion. It was treason. But it's all settled now. Colin's been executed. What? He was beheaded this morning. There was nothing I could do. I was too late. He wasn't a traitor. He wasn't a rapist. They said he was involved in an English plot. I don't know who to believe or to trust. I... I am so sorry, Lola. You're the reason he's dead. Anyone who's close to you lives in constant danger. We're disposable, all of us. No, you're not. I need you. You're my friends. Kenna's my friend. Greer and Aylee are my friends. You are my queen, and we're your subjects. We're here in service to you, whatever that means, whatever it costs us. I will protect you. You can't even protect yourself. I'll do better. I promise. Stirling! You found him. Oh, Stirling. What did I do? I'm sorry. It's just been so hard. I know. So much harder than I thought it would be. You're not alone here. I have my friends. I am not talking about your friends. I meant... I want you to be well, Your Grace. Thank you, Sebastian. Truly. Mother. Where did you find the dog? In the woods. It was drawn to the blood. How close did you get? Take care, my brave son, or you will bleed for a girl who will never be yours. You defended a boy they found in your bed? What was he doing there? You can tell me. I think I know already. You think I was with him to get back at you? I think you're impulsive and prideful. He's dead. Leave it be, I beg of you. You can't behave like this. Not at court. Can't you see what's at stake here? Because we're engaged. But you have no intention of marrying me. What if I told them that? Then this would be over. You wouldn't do that because it's not true; I-I might marry you. Someday, maybe, if. You said that you had a country to think about. Were you thinking about Scotland during any of this? I was thinking about myself, my friends, my safety... You could have ruined your reputation so that I couldn't marry you, even if things go the way we want them to. "The way we want them to"? And how would "we" want things to go? If you weren't the future king of France, and I was just a girl, not the queen of anything, would you want this? I can't do this. I won't. ♪ Lillian ♪ Don't hang your head ♪ Love should make you feel good ♪ ♪ In uniform ♪ You raised a man ♪ Who volunteered to stand... You said the potion would make her sleep like the dead. One glass of wine, and she'd wake with her virtue destroyed, this engagement over. There was nothing wrong with my potion. It was the delivery of it that failed. That stupid Scottish boy. A stupid, dead boy. All to protect his family. From you. I had no choice. The boy would've implicated me, and you. Have your visions altered? No. Mary will bring your son's death. You cannot relent. You must continue to sacrifice. I don't know who you are or why you hide, but your warning saved me. Danger surrounds me here, and I am in your debt. Are you in danger, too? THE HALF BROTHER Lift the back! Some say that only two stories exist: the Odyssey, the journey, and God an Jesus, the rebellion. That these stories are simple retold over and over. That just annoys me. Because where in the New Testament can you read, "The smoke of two cigarettes form white letters..." "Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall." I applied to a course in film history, a good idea for a screenwriter. But I soon quit. All they talked about there was truth. To be true to yourself and your characters. Never lie, tell it like it is. It was nothing for me. Because the truth is, I know why Fred left, and sometimes I think it's good that he's gone. - What is it? - Nothing. - Want to go to the movies today? - Why? - To see a film. - What, and talk about it? ADDRESS UNKNOWN "A boy came down a staircase, into a doorway." "across a street. He's taller than the houses." - Have you screwed her yet? - Huh? - What's with you? All distracted? - I was just thinking. About what? Vivian? Birds? - I've started writing. - Yeah? Yeah. - Where have you been? - Is Mom upset? Maybe I was with Willy. Why didn't you say Vivian was born in a car too? - Have you been talking to her? - Yeah. What, is that forbidden? - Why didn't you tell me? - Didn't think of it. If you're going to keep writing, you have to learn to think. - Where've you been? - Just out. For five days? - What are you doing, Barnum? - Writing. - About what? - "The Small Town". Nice title. - "A boy comes down the stars..." - Stairs. "Across a street." "He's taller than the houses," "he's taller than the..." "street lights. He's taller than the street lights." - "He strops..." - Stops. "He stops at a corner." - "He is alone." - He is alone. "Exterior. Fagerborg, night." Exterior means that it takes place outdoors and interior means it takes place indoors. This is the opening of "The Small Town". "Exterior. Fagerborg, night." "A drunk man crosses Kirkeveien. He's so small that he hardly exists." - That was good. - Nice. - Is there a bathroom here? - End of the hall on the left. I think Vivian is in love with you. Vivian is in love with you. - How do you know? - She's looked at you 86 times. It's probably just because you're an author. - She looks like Lauren Bacall - I've noticed. - And how do you like your brandy, sir? - In a glass. Read some more. "Exterior. Fagerborg, night." ""A drunk man crosses Kirkeveien." - What's this? - I invited the film industry - to an official opening. - Of what? - Barnum and Miils. The year's event. - Will anyone come? It's the hype that matters. For me. For you, seven pages a day. Peder, what do you think of this? - "One eye doesn't see the other." - Totally cool. "The Viking" is a great title. Companies are lining up to invest. Black Ridge wants the script by Christmas. You talked about my ideas? But then it won't happen! I can't sell a script about nothing! "The Viking" will be a film, I know it. - Have you told Vivian your secret? - No. - Can't you just tell it like it is? - She'll leave me. That's not a good enough reason. I think I know where Fred is. In Copenhagen. - You're kidding. - Driving a taxi. Do you want him to come home again? "Congratulations. We stand around you in a ring" "and sing with genuine jubilation." "Bow, nod, curtsey, swing us around. We dance for you all night long." "Wish you all the best all life long. We say with elation," "Congratulations!" - You like it? - I love it. - It goes with your new white shirt. - Thanks, Mom. Happy birthday! - This is from me. - Thank you, Boletta. - Hamsun. - A brand-new edition. We burned the old one. Hamsun was a disgrace during the war. Hapy bertday Love Fer - Now you just need paper to write on. - He just needs something to write. Next time I'll give you the best thing I have. - And what's that? - I don't really know yet. Don't promise more than you can deliver. "The Small Town" Hi. - Guess what. - What? Just guess. - You've grown eight centimeters. - Do I look like I have? I'm an author. I finished "The Small Town". Great! - Want to come inside? - And to say hi to your mother? OK. Barnum, you got a letter. Read it out loud. "Dear Barnum Nilsen. We are pleased to inform you" "that you have won the Oslo School Writing Competition for your grade." "The awards ceremony will be at the City Hall on January 20th at 1:00 pm." "We look forward to seeing you there." You sent in "The Small Town"? Congratulations, Barnum! Well done, Barnum. - It's all thanks to the typewriter. - Don't belittle yourself. Too bad Nilsen is a common name, or everyone would know I'm your brother. Do you want to go and celebrate? I have money. Do you remember when you told me to skip dance school and do the opposite of what people expected? Yes. What if you're doing the opposite of what you want? Then you'll go to hell, Barnum. I thought I'd go over to Vivian's for a while. Good. You and Vivian, that's good. We're so proud of you. Congratulations, Barnum! - Congratulations. - Thank you! - What is the moral of your story? - That everyone is big enough inside. - Do you have any literary idols? - I guess Hamsun. Let's see that diploma. Hold it up. Cheers! Cheers to Barnum, our little author. - She smelled good. - Musk. It makes you aroused. - I can't stay long. - I'll walk with you. - See you! - Take care! You smell of musk. Vivian! Musk. You smell of musk. - What are you talking about, Barnum? - Vivian. She's my girl. You only want her because she's mine. - Shut up, Barnum! - I won't let you. - Let her decide. - Just because you were born in a car, and you're taller, doesn't mean you can take her from me. - Suppose I like her? - You like her. She's my everything. I thought you said I could have the best thing you had. Vivian likes me. I'm a writer. You can't even write. You can't even box. Barnum? Barnum? Barnum? Barnum! Barnum? What happened? Where is Fred? Barnum, where is Fred? - Did you have a fight? - You think I want to fight Fred? He probably just went out. It doesn't look that way, Barnum. Fred went to sea. I talked to Willy. - He couldn't even teach Fred to box. - I called the shipper. It's not the worst thing that could happen. But he could've said goodbye. What kind of ship did he set sail on? Where did he go? The Polar Bear. Greenland. Must you send another telegram? This is the tenth. I'll keep sending telegrams until Fred answers. Boletta? - What are you doing here? - I just dropped by to visit. - I never thanked you for that money. - I want to apologize. I was wrong. Time got away from me, or maybe I never had it at all. Sometimes that's hard to know. It was the hight point of my day, seeing you pour the coffee. You're still absolutely stunning, Boletta. We'd like to send this telegram to the Polar Bear. It's a ship. I haven't seen your half brother for a while. - Fred ran off to sea. Greenland. - Damn. How long will he be gone? - No idea. Fred is a knacker. What's a knacker? It's a zombie, a living dead that eats virgins for dinner. No, a knacker is someone who abandons everyone he care about. - Do you have a shoot today? - No. I'm going to the attic to see how the renovation is going. I thought I'd pack a bit. So it's less stressful when we move. - Then there's the party. - It starts at 6:00. I'll be there. - It'll probably just be us three. - Then we won't run out of booze. I think I know where Fred is. It seems he's in Copenhagen, driving a taxi. Then why aren't you in Copenhagen? Maybe he doesn't want to be found. And it's better not knowing? Is it better going through your whole life not knowing? No. See you. Yeah. Fred? How's Mom? Fine. Why did you leave? Haven't you been happy with Barnum? I've been happy. - I've thought about you two. - What have you thought? That Barnum will be famous now. That you'll have children. That you'll have bought a house. I thought you were the kind of person who'd want kids. Barnum can't. I'm just going to get Vera's dress. - Have you heard from Vivian? - No. But I'm sure she'll be here. Relax a bit. Have fun. Mingle. Drink. - You're a mess, aren't you? - I'm not very tall either. - Full house. - Apparently hype is the trick. - Everyone's here. - Looks that way. - Where have you been? - Out. I'm glad you came. Even if you are a little late. In America everyone is late, at least 15 minutes. So, how would you like your brandy, sir? In a glass. Or not. Come on. THREE MONTHS LATER We're going to have a baby. Aren't you going to say anything? You know I wanted one. We can baptise him in Røst. You know it's a boy? No. But chocolate makes me feel sick. They say that means it's a boy. They do say that. Have you told anyone else? The doctor. The midwife. No one else? Not the custodian or the Norwegian Film Institute or Aftenposten? - Just the doctor and the midwife. - How nice. I'm only number three. - Yes? - Hi, Barnum. It's over. - Fred. - Did he come home? You remember his old peachskin jacket? They found it, in Copenhagen. In Nyhavn. It was just hanging over a railing on one of the bridges there. Isn't it great that I always sewed labels in your clothing? They've searched the canals, but found nothing. The current probably carried him away. I want you to give a eulogy, Barnum, at Fred's memorial service. Fred is dead. Vivian? Vivian? Have you seen my suit? At a check-up. See you at the church. You and Vivian, that's... That's good. - Where have you been? - Out. Why are you so late? I've always thought Fred would come back, just like Robert de Niro at New York's Central Station. But when we ask him what he's been doing, he won't say, "Went to bed early." He'll say, "I've been watching you." One night Fred came home with a coffin. Maybe he knew what was to come. Maybe it was a flash-forward, as it's called in my business. Because here today we don't have a coffin. All we have is a memory. And memory is nothing but a picture multiplied by time. My first memory of Fred... My first memory of Fred is being in the living room, listening to our great-grandmother reading Great-granddad's letter. I still know it by heart. "While we were on the ice, we often hunted seal." "We were quite successful." "You have to shoot while they're sunning themselves on the ice," "if they reach the water first the're hard to get." That's enough, Barnum. Fred taught me never to say thank you. But today I'm making an exception. Today I say thank you, Fred, because Vivian is finally going to have a baby. In my family we avoid conflict. Some fall into a stupor. Some become mute. Some get drunk. And some become knackers, abandoning everyone and just leaving. Kazoku Game (Family Game) Episode 1 List of candidates for firing Stock Seminar Age: 15 years Diary of Numata Shigeyuki Title: My tutor is the worst Contents: My tutor who is the worst came. His name is Yoshimoto Kouya. I won't lose to that weird bastard! why did you betray me? but I couldn't... I didn't know what to write. your tutor came. you thought of me as a friend. It isn't like that. You betrayed me... for many things... it was fun. It was really fun to hang out with you. I thought I had a friend for the first time. do you trust me? are you friends with me? Are you all right after a little while ago? I can be reached for help anytime. Sensei. This is the eighth time I've called you. I expect when you open your mouth... Sensei. Sensei. Sensei. Say something. in order to do this interview with you. For awhile now... - Shinichi. - Shouldn't you be in cram school? Huh? Weren't you seriously injured? - Huh? - Huh? My cram school teacher told me that a dresser fell on top of you and that you couldn't move. Nice to meet you. Did you run here from cram school? Yeah. Good. But who lied? It was me. I'm the one that contacted the cram school. It's a family interview so the family shouldn't be incomplete. Shigeyuki... I know. But this is a family interview. We won't start if the family isn't complete? Correct answer. Bring Shigeyuki. just bring him. Shige-chan? Sensei is here now. would you come greet him? It's okay if you don't want to. Is it okay if you don't have one? - A tutor? - Yeah. It isn't necessary. Seihoukan. He's also in the top ten of his grade. it's embarrassing. - It's not just academics. It's a pretty big deal. We're kites that gave birth to a hawk. It's surprising. - It is? - Yeah. I thought you'd have been more of a problem child. It was no good after all? he's coming. Then what's wrong? It's... I'm Numata Shigeyuki. Nice to meet you. - Shigeyuki! - Please stay calm. - But... - It doesn't bother me. Come and sit down. we'll start the family interview. What is this interview about? this interview is to assess if he's worth receiving my education. Worth receiving? This teacher is saying things really differently from others. Father. please tell me the reason you requested me. I found Yoshimoto-sensei's home page on the internet. Super Tutor Yoshimoto Kouya. Any student under my care has a 100% chance of going to Toudai. Ta-da! Idiot. I consulted with my husband about hiring you and then requested for you. I understand. Have you had any experience with tutors? You're the sixth. They all quit. As you can see this kid is rubbish. Father. He's very different from the eldest. Is there anything you want from this specifically? There is... the same high school as Shinichi. isn't it? - Why? and he has a habit of refusing to go to school. He hasn't gone to school since two weeks after third year started. everything was going well. Why does he no longer go to school? What? Bullying. - Is that so? - Is that so? Right? No comment. No comment. the goals are to get him to return to school and to get him to pass the exam for Seihoukan High School? It would be great if you could. can you tell me what your intentions are? Do you think you want to raise your grades? Computer out of control. Computer out of control. Do you think you want to raise your grades? Computer out of... Do you think... you want to raise your grades? I've decided to take care of Numata Shigeyuki-kun. Yoshimoto Kouya. Pleased to meet you. The tutor did? a slap. I was surprised. is really okay to hire that kind of guy? I also don't know what to think about raising a hand but somehow he has a 100% admission rate to Toudai. That sure is amazing. isn't he? Yeah. That's why I came up with some conditions. Shigeyuki has passed your interview. Now it's your turn. We don't want to waste a lot of money. 000 yen bonus. you'll be fired. We won't pay you. I won't need a week. 5 days will be sufficient. please don't interfere needlessly. That's fine. Um... forcibly taking him there with violence... I won't do that. I'll make him go back to school voluntarily. That's a big deal. I wonder if I should get him to do the same with my daughter. - She'll be taking exams for junior high next year. - Oh. Has she really gotten that big already? it's been a long time since we've been able to talk like this. Yeah. it's been hard to face the guys from the sales department. what kind of circumstances brought you here? Your name is in here. I'll be fired? I'm sorry. after all. it's easy to use the internet. Let's do it. It'll be cheaper if we all apply for it together. Hey. Kayoko-san is different from us. I doubt she has money problems. It's not like that. I might be able to go after all. Thank you. it's decided. Yeah. it seems like Shigeyuki-kun has been absent from school for awhile. his cold has lasted awhile. Sensei. Hello. Sensei? Yeah. Yoshimoto. right? for Shinichi-kun. that's right. - Let's go sensei. - Yes. - Bye. - Thank you. You came so early. Shigeyuki-kun has a cold? Talking to your neighbors must be hard. That's... What kind of things does Shigeyuki-kun like? Huh? what does he like to eat? To play? To watch on television? that's... I'll find out myself. I'm coming in. I'm honored Yoshimoto-sensei will be teaching me. Nice to meet you. Good. shall we start? Okay. All right. don't worry. cup ramen... you boil water with this. You have a variety of things. That's embarrassing. Please don't take too many pictures. Who is this? It's Maeshima Ami. Do you like her? I was reluctant to go so a friend forced me to. huh. please stop it. So you like her after all. Please give me a break. The photobook? Where is it? The one from that photo. I lost it. - There's no way you'd lose something that important. - It's true. Do you have a diary? Isn't it enough already? - Just let me read it. - No way. - Let me read it. - No way. You only have one friend. Sono-chan. Please stop it. who is Sono-chan? A classmate? - Isn't it about time to start the lesson? - Today is the first day so okay. tell me. let's play a game. Good. I'm home. Welcome home. Your father is working overtime. Wash your hands. Let's eat together. I ate out. I see. I'm sorry. I'll eat it tomorrow morning. you don't have to worry about it. - So strong. - I want to win. You're good. I'll be leaving now. Good work today. Thank you. What happened? hello. I need you to stamp the contract. Home tutor employment contract. it's embarrasing. Where should I sign? Then let's go over here. Please sign here. Did you come just for this? I had something to do close by. just use your fingerprint. how's it going with my idiot son? Please have the bonus prepared. You can say it easily. Then this is your copy. Please take it. How about going for a drink? Did you have errands to do? Yes. I'll be counting on you tomorrow as well. Okay. thank you. - Take care. - I'm going now. - Did you see the show yesterday? - Good morning. Good morning. We were talking about the show yesterday. - Turning round and round. - Yeah. the 9pm one. that's fine. - Thank you very much. Katsuno. idiot. It's delicious with the skin. Right? what's the new tutor like? he's strange. he played games till night with my brother. But doesn't that means they're friendly? It's good. he'll definitely be fired. you're really not going? then Moena and everyone else will be excited. Invite me again next time. Yeah. Do your best at cram school. See you later. - Excuse me. - Yeah? Why are we running now? It's because I rarely get the chance to run with an athlete at the national level. you said that right? I thought you'd have been more of a problem child. What did you mean by that? sensei. Did you do any sports? You weren't running. The day of the family interview. wasn't that a lie? it's 1km. taking a taxi or bus would be faster than running. But you didn't. I called the cram school at 2:55 just before coming to your house. You got there at 3:34. It's a fact that you weren't sweating. and he came home walking. wouldn't he? you made me run? The Numata family is the ideal family that everyone envies. the eldest son is an honor student in both academics and sports. the second son. That's how the neighborhood views this family. it really isn't. This family is flawed. How exciting. I'm home. I'm coming in. are you there? He is. He won't open the door. I see. You pretend to be friendly the first day and then do this. Good. do you want to play a game with me? If you leave the room before Friday I win. you win. I'll do one thing you ask of me. I can ask you to do anything? If I tell you to kill all my classmates? I'll kill them. Okay. Then please keep your promise. the deal is complete. he might really tell you to kill them. right? - I do. Do you have the town pages? All right! Huh? right? Yeah. It absolutely won't open. Good. here. - Thank you. Excuse me. Hello. what are you going? - It's a reform. Huh? what are you doing? I blocked all the exits of your room. - Why did you do this? - You are not going to leave your room anyway - so isn't it okay if it's blocked? - Of course not. then it isn't fair. This is the game. you can give up and return to school. - Stop joking. Someone will let me out. - I see. Do your best then. Please explain this to my husband yourself. good work today. What are you doing? Doing such a thing without permission. I told you not to interfere needlessly. - Even if you said that... - A breach of contract - results in a 10 million yen fine. - Huh? Didn't you look at the contract? Line 87 from the top of the second page. Wait a minute. Huh? It's so congested. Huh? That means a payment of 10 million yen. Wait a minute. I wonder. The holes from the drill might remain. isn't that cheap? If you say so. I'm at work now so let's calmly have a talk later. I'm off. See you later. Sorry. Was that the tutor? Yeah. Seems like he's overdone it. Then why not fire him like your doing with me? you've misjudged. You can do better somewhere else. Then prove to the company you're better. Make them regret this. I need a favor. What is it? Please cook dinner while I'm here. I'm the only one that can open that door. there's only about one hour left. That's... Being told that so suddenly. there is one more thing. This is the construction costs. there's an anime that I want to watch. - Please don't push me. - Please let me go home. father. - What's wrong? - I'll be leaving now. But in Shigeyuki's room that's right. isn't it fine? This kind of drastic thing is needed to remedy Shigeyuki. This is the construction cost. Can we talk? isn't there. I had to tell someone I joined the company with that he was being fired due to reconstructuring. He and I had competed to be the ace of the sales department. The two of us made several billion yen. I'm now in a position where I have to fire friends. It's because of that. working hard for my company. I've lost my motivation. It's because of that. There's no way I could afford spending such a large amount of money. Then how are you living in such a big house? I had to ask my wife's family for help. isn't it fine to ask them again? I can't do that. I have my honor. so I can't tell them. - You can tell them. - I can't tell them. You can tell them! - Just take it. - Just tell them. - I can't tell them. - Just tell them. I said just take it. Are you okay Shige-chan? I can't open this since I don't have the security code. he wouldn't tell me. the sensor will start ringing and the people from the security company will come. and I don't think that would be good for you. Huge responsibility. " " - More salad? - No thank you. " "I mean it's great, but you didn't put enough salt. " Aren't you going to answerit? I'll answer it. No it's the wrong number. No salt, right? Wrong number. "What's the age difference between you two?" " - Four. - Three and a half. " Do you have siblings? I have an olderbrother. Though we don't really get along. Really? Lale and I are very close. Now it's mine! I guess it's gonna ring in turn. "Lale yours will probably ring in a while. " What? Okay. I'll be right there. Is something wrong? There's a problem at the bar. No way. Sorry, I really have to go and check. Let's have some coffee first. Sorry, but it's urgent. It will take two minutes. Thanks, but maybe next time. If it's not too urgent... He says he has to go. "Thank you forthis lovely albeit short evening. " Let me get the screwdriver. Good night Lale. Good night. Okay speak. What do you have to say? "I don't understand why you're so asocial. " He's a good guy obviously. Well I don't get you! How can you be so chummy with him? "He comes fora screwdriverthen he's having wine!" Don't exaggerate. He's harmless. "Why talk? It's so obvious why you invited him. " You're in heat again aren't you? Don't be ridiculous! "You had such a stupid grin at the table. " "Enough! I can't take this shit anymore!" "Are we going to find a plumber orwhat!" It wasn't the wrong number. What? It was Ferit who called. He found the house number. Fuck. Why don't you just talk with him? I don't want to. Is it that hard to understand? "Breaking up with him like this, it's plain stupid. " He's gonna keep calling. You know it. What should I do? Tell him everything? "Orshall I be like you. Act like nothing everhappened. " I'm just trying to help you. When did you ever help me? I have to do everything on my own. "All you do is put pressure on me, nothing else!" Fuck you. I nevermeant to leave you alone. But I had to go. I couldn't deal with it. Ljust had to leave. Then I got the job offer. "Grandma wouldn't stop asking about you. " "Each time she asked, I had to defend you. " Where to? I'm gonna take a walk. Why? I just really need to walk. But... Who knows what's out there? "I'll be right back. Nothing to be scared of. " "Please don't go. I don't want to be alone. " Good evening. Are you lost Miss? Let's give you a ride. No need. Thanks. Oh come-on! "Where are you going all by yourself, this time of the night?" Hop in, we'll take you. I'm just walking. Is it a problem? "Don't be like that sweetheart. We just want to take you home. " Who are you calling sweetheart? Get out of here. "Don't be like this. We're trying do to do you a favorhere. " "Talking like that doesn't become you. " Who are you to do me a favor? Asshole. If I get out I'll fuck you up. Then get out of the car! Get out! Cunt... " - Get out, let's see what you will do! - I'm gonna kill you!" " - Get out, you jerk! - Let it go, dude. " I'll fuck you up, you cunt! Get out, you asshole! "She's a dumb bitch. Let's get out of here. " I'll fuck you up bitch! Fuck off jerk! Yasemin is that you? That was a nice walk. It's been an hour. You're really late. Let's go togethernext time. "Fine. Sit in this house forthe rest of yourlife. " Yasemin? Did something happen? Did you take your medicine? Yes. You need something? No. So go to bed. "The murdering of women just don't seem to stop. " "Just today, in Bursa, Kayseri and Kutahya... " "... three women were the victims of male violence. " "E.Y. Who ran away to herfamily from her violent husband... " ...was then stabbed by her brother. Good morning. " - How are you this morning? - What?" "I asked how you were doing this morning?" The same as always. "So you smoke first thing in the morning?" Me too. Can I have one? Sure. It's my grandmother's. It's real nice. Oh the screwdriver! Here. Where did you get the scarf? "I always get this sort of scarf formy girlfriend. " I can neverfind one so pretty. This... used to be my grandmother's. But listen: There was noise coming from the pipes. "I first thought they were from my pipes, but it's yours. " Sorry I... lost track. The waterpipes. Yes the pipes. We'll fix them. I know a plumber, he's great. He does the plumbing of the bar. You have his number? I'm going into town. I have some errands to run. I can take you to him. Let me ask Yasemin. Lale if your pipes burst... Both our houses will be wrecked. Can I... take this newspaper? Is it OK if I keep it for now? Sure, I'll be right back and we'll go. " - A loaf of bread please. - Sure" "Went out to find plumberwith Kerim. Lale. " Hello Ferit. This is Yasemin. How about we get some food? I should go back. Aren't you hungry? I'm starving. " - Is it close by? - Really close. " Just around the corner. OK. Can we order? "It must be hard being a doctor at a state hospital. " Sure, it's hard. But I like it. I could neverbe a doctor. I get queezy when I see my own blood. I feel like I'm going to faint. You get used to it. It doesn't last. Impossible, I could never. Yasemin? Don't you rememberme, child? I'm your aunt Selma... Yourgrandmother's old friend. "Of course I do Aunt Selma. How are you?" " - Oh dearie, my legs hurt. - I'm sorry. " But I'm well. Sweet child... You're all grown up! "It's been so long since we've seen you. " Yes, it's been a long time. So are you married now? No I'm not. How about yoursister? She's not either. You modern girls! Only thinking about yourcareers! So you're back from the States? Yes I'm back, Aunt Selma. "Yourgrandmothermissed you so very much!" You nevervisited her even once! "This valve has to change forsure sister. " "Even the end of these pipes have gone rusty. " Take a look. It's leaking... Yeah right there. I have to look at the othervalves. You mean inside? Yes, how else can we do it? Sure, right. Let me show you. Fuck. Now, listen sister... All the pipes intersect in this wall. I see. These pipes can go on forsome time. "But if they burst, the damage will be irreversible. " What should we do? Do we have to change them? "Yes, we'll have to put new pipes externally. " Lale! My sister is back. Yasemin, wait up we're coming. Mr. Muslum came to check the pipes. So you finally got what you wanted. All the pipes have to change. What? Unfortunately, sister. If these pipes burst... "The infrastructure of the house will be damaged. " Really? The sooner you do it the better. How much do you think it will cost? Around 3000. That much? I'll take care of it, don't worry. Did I ask you to take care of it? When can you do the job? We can start immediately. We're free these days. Then you can start tomorrow morning? Tomorrow morning? Yes. Is tomorrow all right? Sure. We can come around 10. Good. See you tomorrow sister. Don't worry. It's not as hard as it sounds. One can find a plumber if needed. As you can see. Actually it seems a bit weird to me. You didn't really like... Kerim. "I thought you wanted me to be more social. " Do whatever you want. Yasemin. What is it? I left a newspaper here. So? Didn't you look at it? What for? Lale! Sweetheart! My love. "I've been so worried. I've called you so many times!" Why aren't you answering my calls? Hold on... just a minute. How did you find this place? What do you mean? How did you find this place? Yoursistertold me. At least someone answered my calls. I don't believe it! How can you come here like this? "Lale, sweetie, I came here to talk. Tell me what happened. " "Something must have happened, This isn't like you. " Is it about yoursister? "You know you can tell me everything my love... " You look so thin. I was so worried! "Come let's go somewhere quiet and you can tell me what's going on. " Will you say something? I... I... Have nothing to say. There's nothing to say. Oh really? "Look I came all this way just to see you and talk. " You owe me some explanation! "I had to pull myself together... I needed to be alone for a while... " I had to get away from it all... "You cannot talk to me this way! I'm yourboyfriend!" "You can't talk to me like some one night stand you spread yourlegs for!" Go away! Go away! Fuck off! Go! Don't touch me! I'm done. You can come in. Why don't you come? I think you're right. About what? Nothing is as bad as it seems. I can try to be myself. I can pull myself together. Do you really mean that? Everything is gonna be OK. I promise. There's nothing to worry about. There isn't. Is there? There isn't. What's up? I'm going swimming. At this hour? Yes. So what? I feel like it. Where will you swim? From right here. "You can't see the rocks this late. You'll get hurt. " It will be fine. You jerk! You still fall forit! I was terrified! Come-on let's swim. What are you talking about! Kerim? How are you? OK, you? Good, thanks. "The plumberwill change the pipes tomorrow. " Thank you so much. Not at all. Actually I wanted to say... "Would you like to come overfor dinner?" "I'd love to but I have to go to the bar. " I tell you what: But right next to my bar, "there's a great fish place. I've got an hour. " We can have some nice seafood. All right. That would be great. Let me tell Yasemin. " - Ok good. - Ok see you tonight!" You won't have to cook tonight. Why is that? Kerim invited us for dinner. Really? "Apparently he knows a great fish place. " He insisted that we come. And you said yes? If it were up to me I wouldn't go. "But, he talked about how cute you were, all day. " I didn't want to ruin it. Are you serious? He kept asking about you. "Get ready. We have to be in Alacati in an hour. " You really think Kerim is into me? Well. Absolutely. I think he likes you. Where is Kerim? He'll be here. " - Hello, welcome. - Hello. " " - Table fortwo? - Three. " You can sit here. Thank you. What are you looking at? You're so beautiful. Really? Thanks! Hello. Here he is! Hello. " - What's up? - I'm good. You?" Good. Hello. Hello Kerim. Hi... Any trouble finding the place? Not at all. Hello Mr. Kerim. " - Hello. - How are you?" " - Fine. You? - Well thanks. " What kind fish do you have tonight? "We've got sea bass and fresh red mullet. " " - I'd like the sea bass. Girls? - I'll have the red mullet. " "Lale, you too right? She only eats red mullet. " Actually, I don't just eat red mullet. But yes, I'll have red mullet tonight. See! You don't eat any otherfish! "We'll have the usual mezes. How about some raki?" " - Sure, why not. - Let's get a 50 cc bottle. " Right away. I love this place. We can't thank you enough! Not at all, it's nothing. Where's your bar? On the right, around the corner. "You have to come to the opening next week!" Of course. "Were you always in the restaurant business?" Actually no, I used to study law. No way! Yes. But then I dropped out. "My dad went crazy. My whole family are lawyers. " I wanted to study literature. But both our parents were doctors. "So I ended up being a pharmacist. Same old story. " "How come you didn't want to be a doctor?" She couldn't get into med school. But she's a great pharmacist. "Before she came back, she was in New York," "working in a big pharmaceutical company. " So why did you come back? "She missed herfamily. Didn't you Yasemin?" "Your parents must be so happy to have you back. " "They were smashed to pieces in a car accident 5 years ago. " Yourraki, Mr. Kerim. Thank you. So do you live in Izmir? No I live in Istanbul. But I was born and raised in Izmir. You guys are from Istanbul right? "Actually ourfamily emigrated from Kavala, with the exchange. " But we grew up in Istanbul. My family also came from Kavala! Really? Now I know why I am so fond of you! "If you'll excuse me, I'm going to the rest room. " " - Is it downstairs? - Yes on the right. " "Be careful dearthe steps are really steep. " Is Lale OK? She seems a bit tense. She's a bit stressed out lately. She has to loosen up a little. Ok then. Cheers! It's really nice we're neighbors. I think the two of us... are going to have great fun together. Yes, I think we'll be great friends. My girlfriend is coming next week. "You'll meet hertoo, she's really sweet. You'll like her. " Yes, I'd love to meet her. Are you relieved now? Yes I'm relieved. Good. " - How are you? - I'm OK." " - You're flustered. - Really?" " - Is it hot? - No I'm fine. " Here are yourmezes. I'm starving! The calamari looks great. "I'm so tired of vegetables, that's all she cooks. " At least I keep you fed. Right Lale? Lale can't cook for a dime. At least I don't pretend I can cook. "You were happy devouring my beans the other day. " "Why don't we just enjoy our meal?" "Yes, why don't you just enjoy the food. " " - You won't find it again. - I'm sure yoursister... " Hold on Kerim. "It was nice lazing in your room, when mom and I were cooking. " Why do you have to bring up mom? "I can bring herup when I want. Was she only yourmom?" "Was she yourmom, when you didn't show up at herfuneral?" Fuck you Lale. I didn't do anything to deserve this. Sorry Kerim. "Sorry, I didn't know it would be like this. " Are you sure? Nevermind. You shouldn't let hergo by herself. "Sorry. See you. " Sure... see you. "How dare you talk to Ferit without asking me?" This is what you are! You should be thanking me! "I finally managed to do what you couldn't. So what?" "I don't need you telling me what to do. You're so selfish!" Don't try to pin this on me too! "I'm tired of being held responsible for all yourproblems. " Which road did you take? " - You know the roads betterthan me? - No I don't. " "That's why I'm asking! I've never seen this road!" Stop yelling at me! " - There are no lights, nothing! - I said stop yelling. " You took the wrong turn! "They all go to the same place anyway. Just shut up. " What just happened? The engine stalled can't you see. If you don't get it fixed... "... this is what will happen! This is what you get me into!" We're stuck in the middle of the dark! I can't breathe. Stop pretending Lale. I'm not pretending! I'm gonna go out. Okay calm down. Breathe slowly. Breathe. Stay calm. Okay calm. Calm down. "Don't tell me to calm down! I can't calm down!" Everything is broken here. It's just the car. We'll get it fixed. Am I talking about the car? You know what I'm talking about! You're not saying anything! "Please say something. Please, please say something. " The man is dead. He's dead. You killed him! You beat him to death! And I left him there to rot! Say something. Say something. "You're gonna say something! You have to say something!" He was hurting you Lale. I had to stop him. If you had come on time... "... he wouldn't have done anything to me. " He couldn't have! You were late. Why didn't you come on time? "Why aren't you everthere when I need you the most?" How can you say that? How can you be so selfish? It only happened to you, didn't it? "I wasn't there when that lowlife was hurting you, was I?" "I didn't see what he did to you, did I?" "I didn't kill him just to protect you, did I?" I'm only here to protect you, right? Who's gonna protect me? You? Do you realize what I did for you? Do you realize what I did for you? "You only see everything from yourside!" You're so busy with your own misery that you don't see anything else. You don't see me! You don't see me! You don't see me! "Sorry... Our carbroke down. Could you help us?" Sure. Let's take a look. This is really bad. I think the triggeris broken. "You have to get it checked. You can't drive it. " Where are you going? We were going to Sakizlikoy. "We'll drop you off. It's not a problem. " We can't leave you here by yourselves. I'll get the bags. SO, GIL, YOU NEED TO PREPARE A ZINGER FOR THE DEBATE. - WHY WOULD I DO THAT? - ARE YOU KIDDING? YOU KNOW WHAT A ZINGER IS, RIGHT? BRANDY AND CREME DE MENTHE. I'M NOT A RUBE, ANDY. NOT A... NOT A STINGER, A ZINGER. IT'S A COMEBACK LINE. YOU KNOW, LIKE, "I SERVED WITH JACK KENNEDY, "I KNEW JACK KENNEDY, "JACK KENNEDY FUCKED A WIFE OF MINE... BUT YOU, SENATOR..." "ARE NO JACK KENNEDY." YOU GAVE ME SIX CARDS. OH, COME ON, GIL JOHN, YOU GOTTA THINK PREEMPTIVELY. FOR INSTANCE, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF DIGGER WERE TO CALL YOU OUT FOR BEING, LIKE, A HOTHEAD OR A LOOSE CANNON? TELL HIM TO SUCK MY CANNON-SIZED... OH, OH, OH, NO, NO, SEE, YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO HIS POINT, RIGHT? YOU GOTTA TAKE THE HIT, ACCEPT IT, AND TURN IT AROUND AND USE IT AGAINST HIM, LIKE JUJITSU. - RIGHT? SO FOR INSTANCE, YOU COULD SAY, "WELL, I MAY BE A LOOSE CANNON, BUT AT LEAST I DON'T SHOOT BLANKS." GOOD ONE, ROBERT. THE MAN HAS SIX CHILDREN. IT'S A POLITICAL METAPHOR, NOT SEXUAL. AND YOU'LL BE THERE TO EXPLAIN IT TO EVERYONE? SHOULDN'T GIL JOHN BE USING, LIKE, BASKETBALL METAPHORS? LIKE "HOT HANDS" OR "GETTING GOOD LOOKS" - OR "TAKING IT TO THE HOLE." ENOUGH WITH THE KENNEDYS. THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS ASS-CLOWNERY. I GOTTA GET TO BED, OR DIGGER WILL CLEAN MY CLOCK TOMORROW. IF YOU THINK OF ANY MORE STINKERS, WRITE 'EM DOWN. - ZONKERS. - ZINGER. - WHATEVER. - HE'S GONNA BE FINE. NO, HE'S FUCKED. SENATOR BIGGS, DID YOU SUPPORT ADDING ANTI-ABORTION RESTRICTIONS TO THE NORTH CAROLINA MOTORCYCLE SAFETY BILL? I DID. THERE IS NO REASON YOU CAN'T SUPPORT TWO CONSTITUENCIES SIMULTANEOUSLY. IF YOU CAN FIT BOTH THE UNBORN AND BIKERS UNDER THE SAME BILL, THEN WHY WOULDN'T YOU? SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE UNBORN SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO WEAR HELMETS? - HUH? - ROBERT! WHAT? I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP IT LIGHT. HE'S TENSE. WELL, I WANT HIM TENSE. THIS IS A VERY BIG DEAL. THERE'S ONLY ONE DEBATE. - MADDIE... - IF GIL BLOWS IT, THIS TIME NEXT YEAR HE'LL BE SELLING REVERSE MORTGAGES. MADDIE, CAN'T YOU SEE THE MAN'S BRAIN'S ABOUT TO EXPLODE? HE'S NOT USED TO ALL THIS. YOU BOTH KNOW I'M SITTING RIGHT HERE, RIGHT? - SENATOR BIGGS... - QUICK QUESTION, SENATOR. MAY WE ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS? A MOMENT, SIR? WHAT? TURNS OUT THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF MISCOMMUNICATION. UM, UH... IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A DEBATE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HOW COULD IT NOT BE A DEBATE? IT'S A TOWN HALL. - A TOWN HALL? YOU MEAN WHERE A BUNCH OF YAHOOS CAN ASK ANY RANDOM, DUMBASS QUESTIONS THEY WANT? OH, SENATOR, WELL, IT'S NOT THAT BAD. THE, UM, YAHOOS ARE HAND-PICKED, AND THE DUMBASS QUESTIONS ARE SCREENED. WELL, THERE'S YOUR QUALITY CONTROL RIGHT THERE. YOU STILL GOT THIS, BIG GUY. NOW, A TOWN HALL IS NOT A DEBATE, IT'S A PERFORMANCE. IT'S ONE HALF SEDUCTION, ONE HALF MISDIRECTION, - What did you say? You shouldn't've told me you never slept with a man before. It must've been some wild night you getting married so fast. He couldn't really how to keep the goods hidden for a whole two days? What'd he do - tell you the little bobbly thing at the back of your throat was a clitoris? You married a man, you farm faggot! Shut your mouth! I'm Trish. Rape me! - Shut your mouth! - Rape me! You wanna be raped? Is that what you want? You wanna fucking be raped? You wanna play games? OK! This is 911. This is 911. Is this what you want? I'm gonna rape you. I'm gonna fucking rape you, bitch! Miss, miss. I'm tracing your call right now. You like it? Don't you wanna be raped? - You killed my husband! - God-damn right! You're God-damn right! You killed my husband! God-damn right I did! Alright. Miss, miss? I have located you and I have a car on the way. - I'm Trish. - Are you Trish? Fuck you! Fuck, fucking bitch! Fuck you! Is that what you want? You like it! What'd you find out? Lance Collier exists. In fact he continues to exist. He's the guy you described but he isn't dead. Right, so she stole her husband's money just like he told me. But the husband never filed a complaint. Look at the D.A.'s case Mike: you go into a man's apartment with a gun and a knife. That's intent to kill even if you hadn't confessed it. The wife is there, your girlfriend. That's motive. There's a rape on Police tape, along with a number of murderous threats all of which goes to establish a damn tight case. She gave me the keys to the apartment. She gave them to me! They were copies of the originals she possessed. The jury figures you could have had those made up at any time. But... There's not a trace of anyone's fingerprints on those keys but yours. The mace was hers! I believe you Mike. But a jury's gonna be looking for elecrical outlets. If we had one piece of hard evidence to support your version of her manoeuvrings that would be enought to raise reasonable doubt. A note she wrote, the plane ticket to Miami? Phone calls. She made phone calls from my office. Your office, and you made all but one of those calls. She probably faked that one. Believe me, You don't want a jury to hear about that night. THINK! There might be one thing... Hi. I'm Billy Ray Wetnapp for Pest Boys Extermination. And I'm Kelly, your friendly neighbourhood Verminator. And if you're lik e me there's nothing you love more than a good old-fashion cook out. But if there's one thing that fries my frankfurter it's sharing my buns with a bunch of pesky insects. Well, if bugs are making you sizzle just pick up a can of our newest insect repellent Pure-T-Poison. And to demonstrate just how effective it is we've sprayed the Verminator's left arm with it and if she wants her paycheque, she'll have to stick that left arm into this cage of ravenous Samoan dragon beetles and tak e it. - Left? - Right. Got you. Boy, I tell you, I'd rather have my ass caned in Singapore than get bit by one of them. Somebody shoot me! Shoot me, please! It's Manny, me and Ma here at Pest Boys, where our motto is: "The only good bugs is named Bunny." Although, we'd kill him too if you paid us. "Left? Right. Got you"? You know, if you were any dumber, my IQ would go down. Bud, spare me your icky boy opinions and let's get back to the side effects. Look, all it says is that Samoans use these beetles to make a kind of truth serum. Truth serum? Yeah, you know, it makes it impossible for you to lie. For instance, if someone was to ask you, "How much is two plus two?" Now, you would have to be honest and answer: Oh, yeah? Well, I may insult you back, but deep down inside I envy your intelligence and hope you can't see through me. Well, this could certainly be fun. What am I gonna do? - Hello? - Hi, Bud. Hi, Mom. How's everything in Wanker County? Oh, fine. Grandma's doing much better. It was just a mild heart attack, but it took us all by surprise. Oh, please. Jupiter's got moons that weigh less than she does. By the way, Mom, Kelly's been real anxious to talk to you. Yeah. Hold on a second. - No, I don't wanna... I don't wanna talk... - Take the phone! - Hi, Mom. - Hi, sweetheart. - How is everyone? - All right, I guess. Dad's at the shoe store and Bud is holding his own. - And how are you? - Well, fine. Especially considering what a horrible role model you were. But then again you were too busy watching TV and dyeing your hair, so... I'll see you in a few weeks, Mom. Yeah. Oh, my God. Those stupid beetles have me telling the truth to my own mother. That is a squaw that stroked the camel's sack. Why can't I have a job I love like everybody else? Oh, God, I hate my job. - Hey, Al? - I'm back here, Jefferson! Oh, hey, Al. What are you doing? I'm doing some inventory. What's going on with you? Oh, Marcie's in another one of her foul moods. PMS. - You know, post-MasterCard syndrome. - Yeah, I know. I mean, she can charge anything any time she wants but let me buy one stinking ivory-inlaid pool table... Oh, well. You wanna come over see what the limit on a Platinum card looks like before they haul it away? No, to tell you the truth, I'm looking forward to a great night of sex. - I thought Peggy was out of town. - She is, that's what makes it so good. Good one. Do me a favour, hand me that box of sandals over there, would you? Oh, sure. Hey, you know, maybe Marcie could use a pair of sandals... Hey! - Jefferson, are you okay? - I think I got whiplash. I don't have no insurance. Well, then I don't have whiplash. Now, wait a second, Al... Wait a second. There's a bunch of boxes back here, Al. - Give me a hand. - Move them over here. - Check this out. - Man. What the hell? Hey, Jefferson, maybe this is Al Capone's treasure. Why would Al Capone hide his treasure in the wall of a women's shoe store? Maybe he was dating J. Edgar Hoover. Come on, let's get this stuff outside. It's pretty heavy. Oh, please let it be money. It's gotta be money. I know it's money. - I know it, I know it, I know it... - It's shoes. I knew it. Shoes. Al, what kind of numskull would hide shoes in a shoe store? Me. I didn't like doing inventory in the '70s either. The '70s. The clothes, the shoes, the music. Boy, did they suck. Come on, help me wall this stuff back up. Oh, no, no, no. Wait a second, Al. Don't you know what's going on in the world? Oh, look at me, Jefferson. You know that I don't. Al, '70s fashions are back in style now. These shoes, my friend, are worth a lot of money. Yeah, right. These shoes cost less than 20 bucks back then. I know those shoes. They were called Foxy Ladies. I'll give you $200 for those. Who do I pay? Oh, yeah. Jefferson, 100 bucks each. You know what this means? You have to put great sex off for some other night? Put it off? Hell, I'm having it right now. Hi, I'm Terry Murphy with What's Hip in Chicago. And today I'm standing in what used to be called Gary's Shoes and Accessories, but thanks to the genius of one man... That's... That's two men. Two men. - The hip, the trendy and pathetic are flocking to Al Bundy's House of Sole. And now I'd like you to meet the shoe guru himself Mr. Al Bundy. Four touchdowns in one game, you say? My, isn't that something? But for the few viewers we have left, Mr. Bundy what inspired you to create this environment? Well, you see, Terr... You don't mind if I call you Terr, do you? Yes, I mind. Oh, well, you see, Terr, I think that the... I think the '70s symbolizes the very best in America. Take The Avengers, the Shelby Cobra, "Bad Moon Rising." That was the '60s. Well, take Miami Vice, the DeLorean, "Ebony and Ivory." That was the '80s. Well, what happened in the '70s? The Ford Pinto, Diff'rent Strok es and Billy Beer. This is Terry Murphy for What's Hip in Chicago wishing I were Terry Murphy for What's Hip in L.A. Diff'rent Strok es, really? Back to you, Bob. Cut. Well, Dad, as near as I can count you got 30 crates back there with 10 pair of shoes per crate. Oh, man. That's 30 times something shoes. That's exactly what Kelly said. Right after, she said your lack of parental guidance was directly responsible for her low self-esteem and has coloured her relationship with all men. Oh, and your feet stink. But she's still gonna model for me, isn't she? - Yeah. - Then what are you bothering me for? Go count some shoes. Hey, Al. We've cleared over 5 grand today already. And the more we raise the price, the more they want them. Oh, man. - Oh, women are idiots. - Yeah. - You gotta love them. - Yeah. I gotta have some. Not now, Marcie, I'm working. - What? - John Barnett is dead. No, I heard him screaming. I said John Barnett is dead. You understand? Go on, Crandall. Get outta here. There's nothing more to see here. You understand? I still don't get it. What does this have to do with us? Robbing ajewellery store is a federal crime. Thank you. I don't know. I got a call from a guy I worked with in Violent Crimes. Said it was important. Reggie! Reggie! Mulder! I hate it when you do that. This is Special Agent Scully. Reggie Purdue. - How are you? - Fine. What happened here? Lone gunman took out a salesgirl after she filled up a bag for him. You guys turn up anything? Not much, except this. It's gonna blow your mind. Why? I'm telling you, Mulder, this is going to blow... your... mind. - What is it? - Wait... wait a second. - See why I called you? - What about witness descriptions? White male, five-eleven to six feet, ski mask. - Damn it, Reggie. That's Barnett. - Yeah, but it can't be. Who's Barnett? It was my first case at the Bureau. Barnett was doing armed jobs all over DC and getting away with it. He killed seven people. There was this big task force. Reggie was my ASAC. I was 28 years old. Right out of the Academy. I had this theory on the case. Reggie thought I was full of it. I was full of it. - What was the theory? - That Barnett had an inside connection. An employee at the armoured car company was tipping him off. I was sort of right. Sort of? Yeah, we planted bogus waybills with the armoured car company to set a trap. But Barnett was way ahead of us. That's when the notes started. "Fox can't guard the chicken coop." Clever, huh? - So you never caught him? - No, we did. We did, but not... not clean. An agent died because I screwed up. And what happened to Barnett? He avoided the death penalty on a technicality, but he went down for every job he did. Consecutive terms: 340 years. The judge promised me he'd die in prison. So you think he escaped? No, that's just it. He did die in prison, four years ago. You're sure? I was paying attention. This guy a friend of yours? Yeah, I play golf with him every Sunday. What do you think? You just brought this in ten minutes ago. You're slipping, Henderson. Ten minutes may be enough time for you. Course, I wouldn't know from experience. Yeah... Seriously, what do you think? OK, first impressions: the ink is fresh, the note was written in the last 48 hours. Ballpoint, but you knew that. A right-hander. Let's see... Written by someone sitting down. Now I'm just showing off. Yeah. Does it match Barnett? I'd say it's him. But you're not sure? 95 per cent. Writing's sloppy. Some of the ascenders and descenders are heavier. Could it have been traced over an old note of Barnett's? Could be, but it's a damn good job if it is. - Thanks, Henderson. I owe you one. - Promises, promises. There's Barnett. We staked out an airport warehouse, but everything went to hell when Barnett took the driver of the armoured truck hostage. Where's Mulder? There, coming round back. Barnett doesn't see him. - He's got a clear shot. - Yeah. He should have taken it. But he couldn't. No, no, not with the hostage so close. Because it's not by the book. It would have saved one life, maybe two. Bastard Barnettjust started blasting away. So Mulder did shoot Barnett. Twice - in the shoulder and hand. But not before Barnett killed the driver and Agent Steve Wallenberg. Mulder... never forgave himself for that. You should have heard his testimony at Barnett's trial. Probably had a lot to do with the sentence Barnett got. I'll never forget Mulder coming down from the witness stand and Barnett turning and saying he'd get Mulder. To tell you the truth, I wish Mulder had killed Barnett right there in the warehouse. - What did Henderson come up with? - 95 per cent sure it's Barnett's handwriting. What's that? Federal Bureau of Prisons sent me a copy of his death certificate. Name of deceased: Barnett, John Irvine. Cause of death: cardiac arrest. Date: September 16th 1989. - Then it must be a very clever copycat. - The note was written in the last 48 hours. - Pull any prints? - No prints. Barnett had time in prison to plan this with someone on the outside. - Revenge from the grave? A neat trick. - He planned to get you, didn't he? I was just down talking to Agent Purdue. He show you the video tape? - You did the right thing, Mulder. - Did I? Steve Wallenberg had a wife and two kids. One boy is an all-star on his football team now. I shoot two seconds earlier and Wallenberg'd be here to see his kid play. Instead, I got some dead man robbing jewellery stores and sending me haikus. Let's go! Go, go, go. Right in there! Very good! Way to go, Alec. Two! One! Hut! I'll get you, you son of a bitch! I've been thinking about it, Mulder, and I think somebody is messing with your head. - Barnett said he'd get me. You were there. - l don't care what he said. He's dead. - Apparently not. - Aw, come on. There are a lot of guys who know that Barnett made the threat. It's Barnett, Reggie! - How could you say that? - l don't know. I just feel it. All this talk around here about Spooky Mulder, I never paid it much mind. I figured it was just talk about how paranoid you were an' all. And now? Remember the day you walked into my office wet from Quantico? You pissed me offjust looking at you, but then I saw how your mind worked. How you were always three jumps ahead. It was scary, Mulder. Everybody said so. - l've heard this story. - Well, maybe you ought to hear it again! You let a lot of people down here in the Bureau. They had big plans for you. A lot of people are saying that Spooky Mulder has become an embarrassment. A liability. What? Are you saying that somebody from the Bureau's behind this? Maybe, maybe not. Just always best to cover your ass. Sorry. This was just faxed. It's a copy of John Barnett's last will and testament. No surviving relatives. Left what little he had to another prisoner, a Joe Crandall, and instructions to be cremated. His will was executed six months after his death and this states that his ashes were spread along the bank of the Delaware River by an employee of the crematory used by the prison. Somebody's messing with your head. Killing a salesclerkjust to leave me a note? I'd say that's going a little out of your way. He's older now. He may have put on some weight. - How much older? - Five years. He could be wearing any kind of disguise. Take us back to the day in question. Was it your impression, Agent Mulder, that John Barnett took a perverse pleasure in his crimes? Didn't he send you notes to taunt you? Yes, I felt that he was daring us to catch him. That he killed his victims almost as if it were part of a game. Describe for the court, if you would, Agent Mulder, what happened when you finally caught John Barnett. We had a customs warehouse at the airport staked out. We knew Barnett had someone working for the armoured car transport tipping them off about large cash shipments. But we never figured he'd be inside the vehicle when it arrived. That's how Barnett was able to take the driver of the vehicle hostage. In other words, John Barnett used his own accomplice as a hostage? Yes, ma'am. And then what happened? We surrounded Barnett and we ordered him to surrender his hostage and his weapon. And where were you at this time, Agent Mulder? I was right behind Barnett. With a clear shot of the suspect? Yes, ma'am. But you didn't fire. Why? No. lt's against fbi regulations to unnecessarily endanger the life of a hostage. And I thought that with no means of escape Barnett would give up. But what happened instead? The suspect, John Barnett, fired his weapon point-blank at his hostage and then he turned his gun on Steve Wallenberg. Shot him in the face. Thank you, Agent Mulder. No further questions at this time. He gunned him down just for spite. Your Honour, we object! This was a man with a wife and two small children, and you shot him without... hesitation, without a conscience - or humanity! - Your Honour, do something! Which is why you should die like an animal, you son of a bitch! If you do not stop, it will be contempt of court. Order! If there's not order, I will be forced to clear the courtroom! Your Honour, this is inflammatory against the defendant. - l ask that it be stricken from the record. - Duly noted. The jury will disregard the witness's last statement. I'll... get... you. - l'll need print-outs of every variation. - Right. I just got off the phone with the prison. - What did they come up with? - No, I called them on a hunch. Barnett died of a heart attack. Or so it says on his death certificate. Well, I had them fax me all of his medical records. Barnett was admitted to the prison infirmary for an infection in his right hand. There isn't any indication or diagnosis of coronary complications. In fact, on his physical six months earlier he was given a clean bill of health. Crandall, someone to see you. I don't get many visitors. - You knew John Barnett? - Yes, sir. How well did you know him? Pretty well. He left you everything in his will. You must have known him better than "pretty well". I used to change his bandages and we just got to... know each other. Are you aware that Barnett died of cardiac arrest in this facility in 1989? - Cardiac arrest! Where's it say that? - On his death certificate. He ain't dead, is he? Why do you say that? Last time I saw John Barnett was right in that room over there. Doctor with a knife took his bad hand clean off. - What doctor? - Was it Dr Ridley? Yeah, it was Dr Ridley. That's the one. He told me Johnny was dead, but... I knew it was a lie. He put a knife up under my chin just for asking. How could you tell Barnett wasn't dead? I saw him looking at me. I saw him blink. I'll never forget those eyes. What are you gonna do? I know what I'm not gonna do. I'm not gonna wait for Barnett to send me another valentine. You mean the ghost of John Barnett? I didn't know you believed in ghosts, Scully. Hello? Yeah, just a minute. It's for you. Mulder. Fox Mulder. - Barnett? - l'll run a trace. - You sound surprised. - You know... Shouldn't I be? You know, it's illegal to tape another's phone call without their express permission. Isn't that what they call it? In some states. What makes you think I'm taping you? Same thing makes me think you're tracing this call. What state are you in? Same state you are! I stood next to you in line for coffee this morning. I don't think so. Man, I'm everywhere you are. Everywhere. I own you. How do I know it's really you? What did I say to you in the courtroom? Did you ever doubt me? I don't know. What did you tell me? Huh! If you think you're gonna keep me on this phone with this... clumsy act... Listen, by all accounts, John Barnett is a dead man. Oh, you're the dead man, Mulder! Fine. I just need confirmation that you are who you say you are. You want confirmation, you got it. Barnett... You there? - You lost him? - Yeah, he was hip to the trace. Was it Barnett? John Barnett was from New Hampshire. He had a slight accent. Listen to this. Fine. I just need confirmation that you are who you say you are. You want confirmation, you got it. - What did he mean by that? - l don't know, but that is... John Barnett. I'm sure of it. - Yeah? - Reggie, it's Mulder. What do you want? It's the middle of the night. It's only 10.45, Reggie. Yeah, well, I was sleeping. Listen, it doesn't look like Barnett's dead after all. Now what? I got an inmate at the prison who swears he saw Barnett alive the night they say he died. Mulder, go home. Get some rest. Just one thing doesn't make sense to me. What's that? Agent Henderson said that that note left at the jewellery store - was written by a right-hander. - Yeah. So? This inmate swears he saw Barnett's right hand amputated. Reggie, are you there? Hey, Reggie! Reggie, what's goin' on? Are you there? What the hell's goin' on, Reggie? Reggie! What happened? Hey, Reggie! Reggie! What's going on? Are you there? What the hell's goin' on, Reggie? I hope you brought your fine-tooth comb. I want every piece of lint analysed. If nothing turns up, run it through again. Mulder. His wife died of cancer six years ago. He never liked to talk about it. As long as I knew him, he was working on a mystery novel. He promised to show me it, but he never did. I think he was afraid I wouldn't like it. I'm probably the only guy in the Bureau he trusted enough to even ask. I'm sorry. I'm just thinking how different things would have been if I'd shot Barnett. Mulder, we're still not 100 per cent sure this is him. Fresh ink, slightly smeared. I hate to tell you, and I'm not known to be wrong, but this note was most certainly written by a right-handed person. You see the pressure points inside the pen grooves? It's a dead giveaway. Would you be able to tell if this was written by somebody using a prosthetic hand? Well, this fella - and I'm assuming from the cursive figures that it is a male suspect - he has a fairly nice, fluid style. Judging from the pressure variations in the connectors, they would need good finger dexterity. You won't get that with a prosthesis. You think it's the same person that wrote the first note? - This the guy you think killed Agent Purdue? - Yeah. Know what occurred to me? You never got any prints off those notes. If this guy was wearing a glove on his pen hand, note wouldn't be smeared like it is. For what it's worth. I was just trying to find you. Listen to this. According to the AMA, Dr Ridley, who signed Barnett's death certificate, hasn't officially been a doctor since 1979. - What do you mean? - His membership wasn't renewed after Maryland State revoked his medical licence for research malpractice and misuse of a government grant. - Where does it say that? - The National lnstitute of Health's journal. What kind of research? He was conducting experiments on children afflicted with a disease called progeria. The patient, you see, is an eight-year-old girl suffering from the advanced stages of progeria. She looks about 90. Only about 100 cases have ever been reported, so the disease is rare. But fatal. Some patients make it to early adulthood. Others become terminal aged seven or eight. What's the cause of death? Clinically it's cardiac or cerebral vascular disease, but actually these poor kids die of old age. is that Dr Ridley? Yes. ln 1974. Joe Ridley thought that he could take their accelerated ageing and slow it down. Initially, some of his lab work was promising, but then things got out of control. He wanted to begin human trials. Why wasn't he allowed to? Because he hadn't met the criteria. It was all too hypothetical, too dangerous! I mean... I knew Joe Ridley. He didn't care about those kids. He talked about them as if they were laboratory animals. This terrible disease, progeria - he saw it as a wonderful opportunity. He used those exact words with me once. An "opportunity" to unlock all the secrets. When they refused to allow the human trials, he became enraged. Do you know what they called Joe Ridley behind his back? - What? - Dr Mengele. So how did Dr Ridley eventually lose his medical licence? He went ahead with the human trials secretly, on an outpatient basis. When we learnt about it, we terminated his grant and filed charges with the state medical boards. I'm afraid your colleague Dr Ridley has dropped off the face of the earth. Yeah, although it's rumoured he went to South America to continue his work. - You don'tjust reverse ageing. - Ridley's found a way. He wanted human research subjects, right? Prisoners like John Barnett. It's science fiction. What would you have said 20 years ago about gene splicing? DNA fingerprinting? Cloning? Artificial intelligence? Maybe the man's not in his late forties. Maybe John Barnett has found the perfect disguise: youth. I wanna age him backwards now. Let's start with ten years. Now five years more. And add 20 pounds. A healthy 20 pounds. Ridley's notes from the human trials at nih indicate he didn't see ageing as inevitable, but as an opportunistic disease. A disease that could be prevented, reversed even, by changing the chemical cues that trigger certain genes. However, there is no evidence whatsoever that Ridley's work yielded any results, or that his theories, all hope to the contrary, hold any validity. According to scientific journals, projections on this kind of genetic engineering are at best speculative and futuristic. Who is it? Dr Joe Ridley. If you're really Dr Joseph Ridley, where have you been for the past five years? I originally continued my research in Mexico, but for the last three years I spent my time in Central America. ln Belize, to be exact. What about Barnett? He's the only patient left. The only one who survived the experiments. What about you? My appearance is deceiving. I have no more than a month to live as I am dying from a rare cerebral vascular disease. The disease that kills kids with progeria? That's right. An unfortunate side effect of the treatment. By using the genetic components of progeria, I was able to reverse the ageing process in the same way the disease expedited it. At the same time, I and my patients became susceptible to the same ailments a child of six or eight would if he had the disease. What about Barnett? John Barnett. If I didn't so personally detest the man, I might call him my one triumph. Barnett's not dying? Only his eyes - which, for some reason, do not respond to the gene therapy. Otherwise, John Barnett appears to be thriving. But how? I varied Barnett's treatment. Once I isolated the progeria receptors, I stumbled on something quite unexpected. These same genes related to myelin production. The material that insulates neurons in the body. Yes. Myelin is not present in the very young, and by reversing the effects of ageing I found with Barnett, I was able to regulate the production of myelin. Myelin being the material that prohibits you or I from, say, regenerating a new hand if we were to have ours... cut... off. You were able to grow John Barnett a new hand? Not exactly. Not a human hand anyway. I could never get the cells to divide or behave properly. l-l'm afraid to ask. - What kind of hand did you grow? - There'd been successful work in London. By taking samples of what we call cell morphogens from an amputated salamander arm and applying them to the back of the creature, they could grow a new limb on a different part of the body. But only on salamanders. - Until John Barnett? - Yeah. - Unbelievable. - My work has cost me dearly. I'm an outcast in the medical community. I was called Dr Mengele, Dr Frankenstein, but I didn't care. Because you knew that if your theories panned out... The man who owns the fountain of youth controls the world. When the AMA censured me, certain sponsors came out of the woodwork. One of them was the US government. They financed your research? You might be more surprised to learn how high up the ladder this dirty little secret goes. I know why you've contacted me. Listen and I'll explain. I am not proud of the way in which this matter was handled, but, like it or not, John Barnett is a fact of life. I wish Agent Purdue were around to appreciate the irony. The government knew full well that Barnett was in the country. You, of course, know that Barnett stole all of Ridley's research. What Ridley doesn't know is our government is bargaining with Barnett to buy it from him. What does he want? A lot of money, immunity, safe haven. Will he get it? He holds all the cards. You're aware that this... freak of science you're negotiating with is a murderer? The information he has could change the course of mankind. Consider the options. I will. Hi, this is Dana Scully. Please leave a message after the tone. Retrieving messages. Hi, Dana. lt's Mom. I just wanted to call and say hi. Um, give me a call whenever. OK, hon. Bye-bye. Hi, Dana. lt's Kathy. I hope you'll still meet me before my cello recital. What's that? It's my private answering machine, or at least it used to be. Meaning? This morning I heard someone dialling in my private code and replaying my messages. Last night I could have sworn someone was in my apartment, but when Ridley knocked I thought I'd mistaken the noise for him. - Scully... - l took this down to Prints before I came up. John Barnett's left index oblique is on the underside of this unit. Mulder. Barnett? Your new friend - Ridley. Don't grow too fond of him. He's gonna die soon, like the rest of your friends. The rest of my friends? One by one. You're not that smart. Tell me, you're not gonna make me prove it to you again, are you? Oh, well, no matter. It'll be your turn soon enough. But you won't get that chance. Oh, no? Who's gonna stop me, huh? Man! This is... this is the land of the free! Well, I'm just checking in. Bye... for now. What does Barnett know from your messages? That my mother called for no reason and I'm meeting a friend before her cello recital. Where's that? We're working at a disadvantage because we don't know exactly what Barnett looks like. Study each of these faces. Know them. - Particularly the eyes. - l'm including a diagram of the theatre. You have six front entrances and four more backstage. If he shows he'll key on Scully, so wherever she is, she should not leave your sight. We've got two hours before the performance. Know this place inside and out. We don't want any shots fired, if we can help it. We want to take Barnett alive. OK? How you feelin'? This is the first time I've ever played the target. Well, let's make sure it's not the last time. Gun! Down! Check her out! Get back, Mulder! Shut up! Back off! Back off! Don't even think about it. Just let her go. Go ahead and shoot! Go ahead, man! Shoot, Mulder. What are you afraid of, huh? What? It's against regulations, huh? No, man, you need me alive, don't you? Cos I'm the only one who knows where the research is, huh? So I could shoot her and you just have to live with it, don't you, huh? Shut up! How about it, Mulder? Just like old times, huh? - Call an ambulance! - l'll do it! Hear me? It's OK, Scully. An ambulance is on the way. Easy. You all right? Don't try to move. Where are they? Can you hear me? Barnett? Where did you hide them? - How you feeling? - Like somebody kicked me in the ribs. The bullet went through eight layers of Kevlar. You're lucky to be alive. What about him? They flew in three specialists to save his life. That guy in the ugly suit is probably cia. He's been trying to talk to him. - ls Barnett conscious? - Yeah, but he's not talking. Mulder, I know what you did wasn't by the book. Tells you a lot about the book, doesn't it? Where is it? Barnett! Come on! Where are the papers? 50 over palp. Vitals dropping. - OK, we're gonna have to hit him. - lntubate. Come on! Come on! Shock him. Shock him now! Got no pulse, no rhythm. They lost him. Bastard'll take that research with him to the grave. Where do you think it is? Who knows? If Barnett didn't destroy it, he could have stashed it anywhere. Which would have a certain cruel irony. Scientific knowledge that could change the course of mankind buried out in a field somewhere, or sitting in some safe-deposit box, getting old just like the rest of us. If he didn't destroy it, chances are somehow, someday, somebody will find it. And when they do, maybe he didn't get his revenge from beyond the grave, but somehow I feel like we haven't heard the last from John Barnett. Visiontext Subtitles by Natasha Cohn I made this! english Kill me! Kill me quickly! If you tell me where the survivors fled to, I'll think about it. Not a chance! I'm so pleased you said that. Ten brave terrorists destroyed the central control room at Persona Century headquarters. While it was a dummy control room, it was still quite an achievement. A dummy? You underestimated Persona Century's information network. Even if you kill me, more of my friends will come! You may have bought the world, but your time is coming to an end! That would be fascinating. Just once, I'd like to see surprise on the face of Lando Hozuki my father. But I wonder when that event will happen? And now you must pay us back for your courage. There's a chance we'll see waves coming from the fourth dimension? Yes, it's just an estimate, but... When? In 20 minutes. It will only last for 10 to the negative 20 seconds. In real terms, it's damn close to zero, but we can't ignore it. Tell Mr. Guren. It must be painful... To turn to gold while you're still alive. You're doing terrible things as usual, Tamaki. What's your business here, Guren? Shouldn't the oh-so-proper heir to Persona Century still be in bed? When I'm plunged into darkness, I don't need as much sleep. So you came to watch your sister play and have your first drink of the day. Don't interfere. I'm only concerned with how the business is running. I came down here to see the sight with my own eyes. What happened here? It'll happen in 120 seconds. The transmutation machine has stopped. Where did Katari go? ! These are the haunts of that huge lunatic sow. I've been looking for you, pretty boy. Come here, boy. We'll teach you real nice. Although, with your brain, you'll never understand what's going on. Katari! What's this? There was never any hole here before! It's been eighteen years since that time. What? What is this sound? What's that sound? It sounds like a horse-drawn carriage. From underground? Don't be stupid! What is that? Vanished... The hole disappeared. Just who are you? Thank you. He's from around here. Uh... What's your name? What is the name of this place? It's Kabuki-cho in Shinjuku. The Dark Side of Tokyo. Then that will be my name. "Darkside?" Is there a good place to stay around here? If you go south for two blocks, there are several. They're pretty cheap if you plan to live here. Thank you. As long as the world is under the influence of a correct social order, it will never fall to devastation. However, when the social order requires a lack of logic and mindless minions to survive the devastation appears as a world of its own. This is boring! Can't we liven things up a little, Mai? If that's the case, how about some music, Messiah people? Quit it. We don't have the time to listen to drunken wailing. Give me one, Mr. Delirium. Thank you. The Messiah Leader understands the world. Okay, what do you want? How about something dark? No, something desolate. Dark and cold. Something to freeze your soul. Fine, I've got just the thing. It's Persona. What's that? People from the Japanese branch headquarters? Never seen that before. He looks like some VIP from the main office. I am here to deliver a message from the main office of Persona Century. A few days ago, several terrorists broke into the main office trying to kill the president. Every terrorist was killed, with one exception. It seems a lone survivor returned to the surface and is hiding somewhere in this district. Therefore, we ask for your help, with the following provisions. First: Those who give us information leading to the arrest of the terrorist will receive a reward of 5000 and a management position at Persona Century's Japan office. Any person to bring in the body of the terrorist, dead or alive will get 100,000 and a position as Division Manager at Persona Century's main office. With that position, you can control one of America's states! So that means those terrorists hit 'em where it hurts! We ask your cooperation. Mai! Wait. Mai! Let her alone. You're just wasting your breath. You ass! Let go of me, Jingo! What business could you have with me, little insect? Insect? Pardon me. Did that disturb you? So, what exactly did you mean by "insect?" A slip of the tongue. I beg your forgiveness. What did you mean? Ninety percent of the Earth's dry land belongs to my company. And you all are parasites living off that land. So we're insects? But those living in this town are the final ten percent that you guys couldn't buy off. So... I'll teach you how to be polite in this town. So, this is what you call honor. I'm gonna make every human being colored with the darkness. Everyone. At the end of the winter sea where everyone feels so lonely. There was no other way back. It's only the way to the darkness. You don't have to suffer. Just leave with the world of Darkside. Hey, I know that song! It's the Anti-Persona Ballad from about thirty years ago. It was a revolutionary anthem. Darkness? You, you, you... Celebration of the vermilion feast. I stare out at death with hatred in my hands. Grieve for the peace by the bottom of your shoes. Here comes the time colored with the darkness. From this town, from this town. This town called Darkside. Are you a citizen of this town? Ever since yesterday night. I imagine we'll have to meet again someday. Mai, are you all right? Darkside! You're incredible! Who are you? I'd like to talk-- Thank you. Wait! I'd really like to talk to you. You ain't got a prayer, Kenzo. Shut up! You're kidding! I'm completely against it. There's no need for us to call Enji back from Africa. We call Enji and suffer a short-term risk. We don't call him and suffer a long-term risk. Which would you choose? The man with the carriage... With an opponent like that... He was so pretty, I thought he was an illusion. Just who was he, Father? No matter. I just don't like the way Enji works. Father, it's okay if I go below, right? There are a lot of terrorists below. Have you forgotten that they even attacked our main office? You forget. I'm the one who foiled their plans. And I seem to remember somebody going down secretly himself. Who could you be talking about? You're such troublesome children. By the way, what is going on with Sayo? Well... She seems to disappear every now and again without warning. In some ways she's even more trouble than Tamaki. The Mirror of Arvis. He came out from here, right? I never expected him to grow up after we sealed him away. You're pretty lazy. - Is that bad? - Not really, but... Nobody would believe that the leader of the Messiah would just sit staring at the moon. So, a delinquent never Looks at the moon? Keep a lid on it. Even babies shut up at the name of Messiah-- Kenzo? Want a kiss? Mai! Did you just say something aggressive in casual conversation? Go ahead. See? Here I come! Wow! You sure know how to make an entrance. Is he the terrorist they're looking for? The guy who attacked the Persona main office? Give the guy a cigar. Whoops... Good evening. Hi. Kiddo, do you have business with this guy? No. Is he your boyfriend? Nope. Really? That's good. Then I'll take him. Be my guest. Please! You can have this! Save me! Save me, please! What's wrong, Mai? Then I'll bid you good night, you clever girl. Sorry, Mister. Looks like I'm not so clever after all. I guess you're right. An "enhanced" human. Makes me sick. I pass on monsters. I'll leave it to my leader. Listen, you! I see. The leader of the Messiah isn't just a figurehead. I underestimated you. You catch on quick. Damn! Until next time. That was creepy. Nicely done. Turns out you didn't need me after all. Quit patting yourself on the back and carry this guy. We've got to get him to a doctor. Me? Why? It's dangerous to get involved with terrorists. Leave him be. I took his money. If you won't help, I'll do it alone. But, in exchange you'll never see me again. Okay, I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm sorry, Selia, but I had to bring him to somebody I trust. I imagine so. He has burns from a high-power laser in five spots. Bullet wounds in four spots. Stab wounds... Shock-rod wounds... Is this that terrorist? If he eats nutritious foods, he can be on his feet in 3 days. You've gotten better, Ms. Former Nurse. Yeah, you never should have been forced to resign-- Keep your big mouth shut! It's all right. I'm just happy people remember me that way. But this is all I can do. Take him home. Selia... I've finally accepted it. I know. Thank you, Selia. Kenzo? Yas'm. I's just a horse to carry yer baggage. Thanks for your help. Give me back my clothes. You can't. If you tried to get up now, your wounds would reopen. I've had wounds like these for the last three or four years. And where do you plan to go? The whole town is crawling with Persona killers. Outside Shinjuku, their private guards are everywhere. The only place in Tokyo that they don't own is right here. No choice. I can't give you any more trouble. If so, I wish you never hired us in the first place. When you buy the Messiah's loyalty with money it means you've bought your life back. I'm sorry. Maybe that was a little corny. Not just a little. Have any friends? Yeah, but I can't reach them since I lost my one communicator. It uses a special carrier wave. I can't make one. Leave that to us. This guy may look like a Sumo wrestler but he majored in electrical engineering. But I don't have any money. Just pay us later. Hey! I'm not taking on any pain-in-the-ass jobs. It's not a matter of money! One more bill. Listen, you... Stay here if you want. Until they build the communicator. But... However, you are not allowed to enter my room. Thank you. Selia, you... Renew yourself! Renew yourself! Number eleven, Crystal Street... That way? Katari! I'm on the first floor, but there's light coming from the skylight. It's beautiful. As if a crystal were melting in the moonlight. Ah, how poetic. Darkside! How strange. When a person comes in from the front hall they go directly to your room? You had business with me, so you came to my room. Those who wish to go to other rooms, go there. Hmm? That's convenient. What is your business? It doesn't seem like renewal. Renewal? You mean Dream Treatment? So, what is this Dream Treatment? Did you treat Katari? Katari? You rescued him that night. He just left here, right? First time I've ever seen him with such a vivacious look on his face. That boy was dreaming a very bad dream up until now. It's not our brains which suppress our souls but dark phantoms. Can you renew me? What do you see? Nothing. I only see the darkness. There are no dreams of darkness. You don't feel sorrow or hatred... You're lying! You're lying! I... I... This isn't sorrow? It isn't hatred? It's a sorrow over sorrow. A hatred of your hatred intensifying. For you, renewal is unnecessary. Come again. Wait! Yes, in these first-world nations, there are a lot of pretty girls. Yo, Babe, let's party tonight. Enji got away? I'm very sorry. He disappeared from a shuttle flying 5000 m above Tokyo. Did he jump out? Yes, without a flying unit or a parachute. We have the Japan office looking for him at the moment. Let him be. Enji is Enji. When he's tired of his games, he'll come back. The end. And with that, the young man pretending to be a white knight is gone for good. It's 'cuz you don't want to go on a date that this happened. Now you'll come with us. We're all at that age where we want some company. Wait a second. That's impossible! Every bone in his body should be broken! Yes, these first-world nations are nothing like Africa. There are a lot of pretty girls, and a lot of stupid men. Dammit! Kill him! You okay? Thank you. No problem. Men just rescue pretty women naturally. I'll take you home. Don't look so worried. Despite appearances, I'm a gentleman. See, I had a pretty strict childhood. You're pretty agreeable. I could get a crush on you. Is this it, Sister? Yo, Sister? Hey, Granny. The lady with me went "poof." She went to the room to which she intended to go. You had no intended room, so you are stuck in the lobby. It's only natural. That was supposed to mean something? This is the Mirage Hotel, and this is its nature. Sorry, but I'm going to take a look-see. Well, in this whole wide world... Is he the guy, Guren? Mr. Vice President, we have an estimate concerning the maturing of the aforementioned man. Put it on my A/V panel. Yes, sir. Alchemist Pigero's special potion, Re-health. It will cure any wound. Thank you, Master Pigero. Please wait, Selia. Take this, too. It's free. But, sir! It's too-- It's okay. I'm hoping you won't need it, but... Thank you. Laser cannons? Damn. I wish that kid lived in a time of peace. He's a strange guy. Any normal person would've gone insane or withered away by now. I'm going all-out! He is a life form who was sealed in a different dimension when he was a baby of just three years, eighteen years ago. His maturation rate was incredibly rapid... Incalculable. What? Really, Guren? Is he someone even you are afraid of? I'm going to call it quits today. I just got a message from heaven. This is my calling card. So, you've got red blood? I'm relieved. Everything was born of the darkness. Renewal comes from the darkness as well. You win. I'm so impressed, you're giving me chills. Let's do this again sometime. If you want treatment. That's out of the question. My weak point is that I'm too thick-skulled. Sorry, Sister. I lost interest in playing games with ladies. Later. Sorry to bother you. It was nothing. If his target was someone other than you then Crystal Street might have been reduced to rubble. We were lucky to suffer so little. Why don't I do something for your cat? Don't bother. It's had its fill of happiness, fun, pain, and sadness. But now that it's seen you it seems to want to live a little longer. You'll make things a little more interesting in this meaningless world of light. That woman's face was darker than my darkness. Hello. What's this? Re-health. I'd like you to put your violent toys away, though. Oh. Sorry. That's your prized possession? Not exactly. Strangely, it always seems to be with me. Algeria, Valna, Mozambique. And then to the Persona Main Office? You're a reckless man to attack the main office. You're right. How many died? Eight. One was captured. And the survivor was sent to Tamaki? "Miss Strangler." She's a true sadist. You're pretty well-informed. The Hozukis. A family of monsters. This is good. It's really good. And I'm not just saying that. I'm always on the run, so my food is always rations. And sometimes you eat weeds and rats. That's right. Dog-meat tastes pretty bad. You got that right. How do you know? You couldn't be a member of the Anti-Persona? An AP Man? I'm glad for that. I've had too many friends die. Sorry. That's something normal people don't want to talk about, right? Is it something to do with your family? Family? My parents are living happily in Vancouver. They decided that I died when I was fifteen. You became a terrorist even though your parents or family weren't killed? You're a strange person. You're probably right. But I can't allow this. People shouldn't be controlling other people! Even if you've got some overriding reason. We can only have peace under benevolent rulership. The governing principle of humanity since it evolved. An ideal that humanity's been striving for. And Persona Century may be the savior that we've been waiting for. Peace under a dictatorship makes us simply minions! Don't give the name of peace to people who gain control through oppression and murder! A misguided nuclear strike was Launched against Iceland. Carnivorous plant fertilizer and herbicides were given to the Congo. An outbreak of the New AIDS virus decimated Shanghai. Who do you think was behind all that? Where people make history, there must be opposition! As long as we're here... As long as our will lasts... Those people who "talk" of peace will have to deal with disgrace! Sorry. I got carried away. It's a quiet world. Everything is filled with that glaring light. I could die from boredom. Are the guys who rescued me your friends? A long time ago. They're still on fire. I couldn't stand the heat, so I ran away. People have a right to live in peace. Even if the peace is rotten to the core? Can't say anything to that. People start battles of their own will. What? Get out of here! They're Persona battle robots. Hurry! Damn! Tatsuya! This way! I've got an escape route to the roof! Where did you get that rifle? Who cares? ! Hurry! The gunfire stopped. Let's go. That's strange. Nobody's here. What's that smell? Upstairs! Search upstairs! What's wrong? What was going on here? Some sort of artificial appetite enhancer? It's nothing more than a hallucinogenic. The Guard can't even handle an assignment like this? It's fine with me, Ben. This only increases the size of our reward. "Kabuki-Cho." "Kabuki-Cho" This place is incredible. "Kabuki-Cho" It's Kabuki-cho in Shinjuku. The most dangerous town on Earth. It's Kabuki-cho in Shinjuku. The most dangerous town on Earth. At the same time, it's the place on Earth with the most freedom. Nobody tries to control anybody else. Nobody tries to force their own will on others. But how did they know where we were? I don't know. Maybe they followed Mai. Maybe... They could have observed us with the ultra-high vision camera installed on their orbital main office 36,000 km above us. They're a tough enemy. But you want to fight them anyway? Selia! Wait here. I'm going to contact Mai. Hey, hey, hey! I'm in a bad mood today! I won't be satisfied with just a sprain! What's wrong with you? You're the suicide hot-line poster child today. Suicide? My old self may have died long ago. Up she goes. It's the phone! Mama! I've got my hands full. Get it yourself! Hello, Junko's Jailhouse. Oh, Selia. You figured me out pretty good. Huh? What did you say? I got it. Stay where you are! Mai! Where are you going? To the old hideout. You can't be going to see that Kabuki-cho jerk-- idiot! When you're finished with your warm-up exercises, come along. Call Chris, too! Yeah, sure. You-- Hold it! Tatsuya? Tatsuya! It started on its own. Just when that girl left my sight. You're an outsider? If you've got something, share it with us. We're just poor beggars. What? You're a friend of Katari's? I guess I was wrong. Don't take it hard. As an apology, you can call me anytime you're in trouble. I'll help you out. I'm surprised. I never met such a small big-man. Do you live alone? Uhh, mister... Katari. I'm Tatsuya. They're all required reading for AP Men. I haven't even read them all myself yet. Thank you. You've read these? What do you think of them? Someday we'll have to end this. What did they say, Mai? Are you that worried? It looks like Tatsuya is with Katari. - That's good. - Not so good. The informant told me that some man asked for the same information. The assassin that you fought? Probably. Who's there? A friend of yours? I came to bring you something you left behind. Excuse me. I examined you without your permission. Examine? Are you a doctor? I killed him. The reward is mine! Who the hell are you? That's impossible! A 500,000 degree heat ray doesn't get you? Are you an assassin from Persona Century? You forgot something. Who are you? When a concept isn't completed, it is passed on. But that inheritor must receive a renewal. Wait a second! Is that the result of your examination? What is this "renewal?" Katari! You ass! What did you run away for? Do you know how worried Selia was? Sorry. I didn't want to inconvenience her any further. But you can "inconvenience" me as much as you want? Thanks for your consideration. No! That's not what I... The assassin! Did you...? No, some doctor in black. Darkside? Where is he? Inside? He left. Didn't you see him on your way in? These two are the people I talked about on the phone. Anti-Persona Century soldiers. Please take care of them until the heat is off. Mai! I'm not involved with the AP Men! They don't believe that. Give up, and impose on the sisters! We can't do much, but we'll do all we can. Thank you very much. But for how long? How long are the Persona Guard going to be in town? I'll leave you alone. Sister! If I don't know, I won't be able to tell anyone. I must avoid endangering the children. She's pretty impressive. Orphans aren't the only ones she saves. She's saved more than a hundred fugitives from the police and the Guard. You can trust her. What's this? God! You forgot already? A communicator. But something this small will never reach the Himalayas-- I mean, never reach Headquarters. I made it, so it should be all right. But the only problem is it'll also reach something 36,000 km above us. The Persona Century radio interception sensor. They'll be able to hear everything. But can you block the sensor for one minute? Impossible! It's like finding a single quill on a porcupine. We'll never know which antenna to block! We'll be so sorry if we get the wrong one... Right? Right. God, this is such a pain! Okay, you two. Spend a restful night in your honeymoon suite. Don't say that! I can't, Mai! Hold it a second! Don't impose too much. They don't have the space for single rooms. That's not what I meant. I know I brought this on you but you guys are going to be targets of Persona Century, too! You're probably right. So you should stay with us... Selia, ask them... Selia? You should work on telling good people from bad. We're just juvenile delinquents. We fit right into this town. So, where do a group of Messiah delinquents go to show their stuff? Fools and delinquents go to high places, like the fool on the hill. Good idea. It's a strange world where delinquents do the work of terrorists. So, why do you own that rifle? It's a violent town. Is that the only reason? My father was a member of the AP Men. He was too enthusiastic, and he caught their attention. One day, he was targeted from 36,000 km above. Just our house. With a quantum cannon. Everything was turned to ashes. My mother... My sister... Stay back! It's strange that this was left unharmed. Is it a I had my eye on you all night long. He's right this time. FATHEAD: See what a little fame does to Null and Void? Anybody seen that fine-Iooking gal in the yellow dress? -You hear this man? -You snooze, you lose. jimmy: We're going to dock your pay. That's $2 off your busride. [Slow jazzy music] WlLBUR: All right, who's next? It's a shame, Jimmy. You're just gonna piss this up your arm. Don't tell me what to do with my money. Come on. Step up. The one-dollar sensation. You want to keep counting? What's the matter with you, boy? $50 ain't good enough for you? That ain't $50. Keep counting. I guess you want charity, since that record of yours ain't selling. [Men yelling] Break it up! What the hell is going on in here? The blind sensation don't like his pay! -He's cheating me! I quit! -You lying son of a bitch! Don't be fighting nobody that can see! I won't run around finding singles for this chump! -There's $50 here. -You see that, fool? Shut up, Wilbur! Ray, from now on, I'll handle your pay myself. I'm tired of this! I'll tell Jack to find you somebody else! You sure? It's cold out there. Don't worry about me, I can take care of myself. LOWELL: Damn it, Wilbur! WlLBUR: Let him go! What are we gonna do now? RAY: "After the death of Moses, the Lord spake unto Joshua saying: "'Moses my servant is dead. RAY: "'Now therefore arise. Go over to Jordan. "'Be not afraid, for the Lord thy God is with thee."' AHMET: Mr. Charles? Who is it? AHMET: My name is Ahmet Ertegun. May I have a moment of your time? What do you want? I'm at church. I'm sorry. I'll come back later. You're here now. What do you want? My company, Atlantic Records... has acquired your contract from Swing Time. I'd like to discuss your future. Hold on. Don't jive me now. I ain't for sale. May I sit down? You see, Mr. Charles... Jack Lauderdale has found himself... shall we say, a little overextended... and has had to unload some of his talent. When your name came up, I jumped at the chance... to work with you. I'm a big fan. What if I want to go to another company? RAY: There's a guy out there willing to pay me... seven cents a record. Can you do that? Man, I could promise you 15 cents a record... but you won't get it any more than he'll pay you seven. What I will do is promise you five cents a record... and pay you five cents a record. If you think pennies, Mr. Charles, you get pennies. You think dollars... you get dollars. I like how you put things together, man. RAY: You know what? Omelet, you're all right with me. Ahmet. -What kind of name is that? -I'm Turkish. Well, I guess Jack Lauderdale's bad luck is my good fortune. I knew that Atlantic Records was bigger than Swing Time. You guys do good music. I dig Atlantic. You could have fooled me. I have to keep my eye on you city boys. Down home, we call it "country dumb." [Ray laughs heartily] Hey, man, it ain't Turkish. [Ray singing romantic jazz song] What do you think? Nobody wants another Nat King Cole. [Ray singing bluesy song] Ahmet, it's just like Charles Brown. Okay, I'll talk to him. All right, fellas, that's a cut. Fellas! TOM: [On intercom] Band can take five. JESSE: He just don't get it. You either sound original, or you got nothing. RAY: Ahmet, what'd you think of that? I want to tell you something, and don't take it wrong. Then give it to me right. I signed you because I sensed something special in you... not because you sound like Nat Cole or Charles Brown. I thought you like what I do. We love the timbre of your voice... we like your virtuosity, your energy-- -But not my music. -Come on, I didn't say that. Ahmet, this is what I do. I got to make a living. People want this. I don't know no other way. We got to help you find one. Let's try a little change of pace. You're familiar with stride piano? You kidding? The man who taught me piano is a stride player. I got a song. It's called The Mess Around. The Mess Around. Cute title. Who wrote it? I did. You wrote it. -Well, sing it to me. -Sing it? I can't read the lyrics. Okay. Well, it's the key of G. Key of G. [Slow piano music playing] But it's a kind of Pete Johnson thing. [Lively piano music playing] Yeah, that's it. RAY: You like that? Here we go. Two, three, four. [Singing] You can talk about the pit barbecue The band was jumpin', the people, too They're doin' the mess around They're doin' the mess around Everybody doin' the mess around That's good. Let me take it from here. [Singing lively jazzy song] -Now we got something! -That's all right. RAY: What do you think, Ahmet? AHMET: Great, Ray! -Unbelievable! -Who's that? Ray, I want you to meet my new partner, Jerry. Mr. Ray Charles, Jerry Wexler. Don't worry, Ray. I'm going to step back, watch... and learn how to produce a record. I'm in awe. That was out of sight. That's some running and riffing, man! Well, this'll make you shout, man. [Upbeat piano music playing] king BEE: We're listening to Mess Around... by Atlantic recording artist, Ray Charles. And we have the gentleman live here in the KCOH studios. So, when you're not making your own music... what do you listen to? The fact is, I really and truly love gospel. RAY: One of my favorite groups is from right here in Houston: the Cecil Shaw Singers. You heard it: Ray Charles endorses Houston's own Cecil Shaw. We'll be playing gospel all day Sunday... but right now, let's hear some more of that Mess Around by Ray Charles. technician: K.B., line 1. king BEE: King Bee. king BEE: Yeah, he's right here. Miss Della Antwine of the Cecil Shaw Singers. Hello, Miss Antwine. RAY: You sung tenor in Jesus Is My Shepherd, right? Yes. How did you pick me out? Actually, I hear like you see. Like that hummingbird outside the window, for instance. -I can't hear her. -You have to listen. Yes. RAY: Yes, you can. -You hear that? -What? Her heart just skipped a beat. Did you like my record? RAY: The one that King Bee was playing? It was very nice. DELLA: Different than the others. I've heard a lot of your music. Was it very nice, too? RAY: Look, if you don't really like the record... you ain't got to beat around the bush with me. My mama never did. DELLA: It's not that I don't enjoy your music. It's just that I feel I've heard it before. I keep wondering what the real Ray Charles sounds like. Ray Charles? Who's he? Nobody, if you don't know. Sorry. I should have kept my mouth shut. No, then you wouldn't be you. It's not like I haven't heard that before. I guess I just never really listened, that's all. Ain't nobody ever put it that sweet, I guess. RAY: You know what, Miss Della Bea Antwine? RAY: You really are a country girl. Yes. How did you know? I could tell by the way you ordered. "Let me get molasses with my cornbread." Were you raised on a farm? My mother did a little sharecropping in Florida. ls she still there? God bless her heart, she passed away when I went to school. Ray, I'm sorry. RAY: She never was real healthy. RAY: She just worked herself to death, poor thing. RAY: That's why she didn't want me carrying around no tin cup. The kids I went to school with were doing basket weaving... and wickerwork. But not you. Because of your gift. Because of my ears. I can mimic damn near anybody... and I make a pretty decent living at it. It's just, if I change my style up and people really don't dig it... what am I left with? I mean, when you're blind, Miss Antwine... you ain't got that many choices. Seems to me like you got all the choices in the world. God gave you the gift to sound like anybody you please, even yourself. We're here. This is where I live. Do you think the preacher would let me in? I'm a sinner, but I need a little prayer. His wife don't like me having male company. Tell him there's a soul out here that needs saving. RAY: You know, Miss Antwine, you really got me thinking. About what? About my life. About my music. RAY: About everything. Ray, don't you think we're moving a little fast? I'm going to go to New York for a couple of weeks... and when I get back... you can take it as slow as you want. All right, Mr. Charles. All right, Miss Antwine. I'll see you in a couple of weeks. Hold on, let me call you a cab. RAY: I got it. Three blocks up, left for two, right for one. RAY: Fifteen giant steps, and I'm at the Crystal White Hotel. Hello. AHMET: Mess Around was a positive step for us, Ray. We're making progress. RAY: Come on, Ahmet, you've been nice to me. RAY: But I haven't given you guys any hits. Atlantic has been good to me, but if you want something special... I'm gonna need my own band. Oh, man. Taking a band out on the road costs a mint, Ray. Even Joe Morris is struggling. His band's had a hit record. But, Ahmet, I'm not Joe Morris. You told me if I think pennies, I get pennies. I'm thinking dollars. Ruth Brown's got a tour booked in Georgia. JERRY: She needs a band. RAY: I'll take it. I could write the charts for her, do backup, and also be an opening act. Okay. AHMET: But you're going to be financially responsible. You'll have to make it work. I'm gonna make it do what it do, baby. Ray? Miss Antwine, it's been two weeks. It's been three. Where's the preacher at? And the wife? They in Dallas till Monday. RAY: Well, hallelujah! Della Bea. Kind of like a honey bee, right? Can I call you Bea? Yeah, I'd like that. There's only been two cats that I ever really trusted in my life. There's Jeff Brown, he's going to be my tour manager... Fathead Newman, my tenor man... and now you. But you gotta do me a favor. You gotta always tell me the truth... just like you did before. Don't feel sorry for me just 'cause I'm blind. How could I pity someone I admire? -Can I play something for you? -Now? -No, Ray. -Yeah, right now. DELLA: It's right there. You got it. RAY: Yeah, this will work. Now you go ahead and play. I'm going to close these drapes. DELLA: I don't want no neighbors looking in. [Singing upbeat song] Ray. Ray, that's sacrilegious. What? It's a gospel song. I know what it is. I wrote it. You told me to find my own voice. Bea, this is it. But it ain't right to be changing gospel music into this. Into what? ls it devil music? Evil music? Do you think I'm evil, Bea? Look, I've been performing gospel and blues all my life. It's who I am. And if I'm gonna do my own thing, I got to be natural, right? I'm singing about my feelings for you. About how I love you. What could be more natural than that? Tell me. More natural than me and you. Ray. [Singing softly] JERRY: We bite the bullet, cancel the tour dates. But what will we tell Ray? AHMET: We'll tell him the truth: Ruth Brown's pregnant, so there's no tour. What about LaVern Baker? Get her to take the tour. She has no record. There's nothing to promote. You and Jesse write a couple of songs, let's get her in the studio. AHMET: It'll take a month to put that-- JERRY: What'll we do? We got to do something. JERRY: Ray's got a new band up there. JERRY: How'd he put together a band so fast? Boss! Boss, they're here. RAY: Come on. Let's get together so we can show them this. AHMET: I'll let you break this to Ray. You're gonna let me break it to him? -Why me? -Because Ruth Brown was your idea. Ruth Brown is a good idea, was a good idea... and still is a good idea. [Ray singing R B song] -Ahmet. -Yeah. We got to get this on wax. Oh, yeah. Hear that, New York? The sound is huge! But there's only seven cats on this record. ALAN FREED: This is the new Ray Charles, baby... and there's nothing out there like it! And you heard it first on The Moondog Show! [Upbeat R B song playing] The Shaw Agency's the best booker on The Chitlin' Circuit... that's my opinion. Milt Shaw, meet Ray Charles. AHMET: It was Milt's dad, Billy... who first drew my attention to a certain blind pianist... when he was booking Lowell Fulson. We believe in your talent. We want to be in the Ray Charles business. We've already booked you on a 1 0-city tour... with Roy Milton's Solid Senders... I love Roy Milton. ...and Tangula the Exotic Shake Dancer. She is gorgeous. Ray, I gotta tell you, we think you're onto something very big here. Nobody's ever combined R B and gospel before. I've Got A Woman is a smash. You better start thinking about a follow-up. This sounds good. I gotta run to Texas... and take care of some business, and I'll be back. Make it fast. I'm ready to sell, sell, sell. As long as you book me in front of Tangula. JEFF: Della, hold on! Let me get my camera. Let me get one picture. JEFF: Y'all stay right there! Ray! Della, let me get one picture! One picture, Della! Come on. FATHEAD: Be careful, Ray. These are your last steps of freedom, man. FATHEAD: Don't open that door. FATHEAD: You got to carry her over the threshold. [All talking excitedly] To the right, Ray! To the right! FATHEAD: Ray, you need some help? You sure you know what you're doing? [Upbeat R B song] DELLA: Ray? [Knocking on door] DELLA: Can I come in? RAY: Hold on. DELLA: What's going on, Ray? Open this door. Why are you locking doors on me, Ray? You know the place is small. We gotta have a little privacy. What we need is a little more room. We're gonna need some space while we start a family. You know I'll be on the road for most of the year. I'm just thinking, what if I'm not a good father? My daddy was never around. He had three different families. Well, you... are going to have one, starting right now. Right now? What do you think? That's what I know. [Singing jazzy song] MAN: Stop it! Y'all done lost your minds! Stop all this stuff! WOMAN: You need to be saved! I can't take it no more. Stop it! MAN: I can't take it! JEFF: Hold on. Take your hands off me! MAN: This ain't right! JEFF: Just let the people hear the music. Y'all sitting here, listening to this devil! You're giving your money to Satan, that's what you're doing. RAY: hold on, you got a problem? MAN: Yeah, I got a problem! That's gospel you're singing! You're turning God's music into sex. You're making money off the Lord! WOMAN: Don't smile at me! Y'all are in it, too! All of y'all are going straight to hell! She's right. No, this here's wrong. The whole thing's wrong. RAY: It's okay. Let him go. You got a right to believe in what you believe. You can go to hell by yourself! Boss, you want to cancel the show? No. Just find me a bari player by tomorrow. I just want to ask the folks right now: If y'all want me to keep playing, let me hear you say "Amen." ALL: Amen! While you're at it, find me a girl... with church-training that can sing... -but without the church attitude. -All right. Let's go, y'all. Keep it going. [Upbeat jazzy music] [Car horn honking] DELLA: Ray, you got your watch? RAY: Yeah. DELLA: Good. All right, baby, your blue shirts are on top... the pants in between, and the white shirts are on the bottom. Here's your glasses. There you go. [Car horn honking] Why don't you come on the road with us? Baby, what would I do on the road? You'd do what I say you do, that's what. I've been trying to get a female voice in the band, anyway. Can't you just picture me wobbling around on that stage... big as a house? Well, I can't picture you, you know that. But I know what I can do. DELLA: Come on, now. Don't start nothing you can't finish. Jeff is waiting. DELLA: I can't go on the road with you... not with your baby inside me. I'm gonna get your shaving kit. Bea, I got it. Bea, hold on. Bea, let me get it. How long you been hiding this from me? I'm your wife! Bea, I was just so excited to see you. I forgot to leave it with the band, that's all. Let me get it. It's just a little medicine, that's all, baby. That ain't medicine to nobody. Don't be lying to yourself. It ain't like I'm dealing it. I just use it to get a little taste. You don't taste poison, Ray. It kills you. You got to stop. I ain't got to do a goddamn thing! What about me? What about your baby? It ain't like I'm new to this. If I felt like this was jeopardizing my music, or you... or providing for that baby... I'd stop in a minute. But I know it won't. How do you know that, Ray? You can talk till you're blue in the face... it don't matter. I'm not gonna stop. DELLA: Then I'm coming with you. RAY: No. -But you just said-- -No. You know what it is, Bea. I think it's like you said. I don't think that the road is a place for you and the baby. What are you saying to me, Ray? What I'm saying is that when I get home... I hope that you're here at my house. Your house? RAY: Jeff, come get this bag. JEFF: All right, Ray. Hey, Della Bea. You all right? [Singing upbeat song] That's good, thank you. -How does she look? -Very pretty. Brown skin. [Ray cheers and claps] Yeah, that's great. I really dig your sound. What was your name again, sweetheart? Mary Ann Fisher. How would you feel if I asked you to sing a torch song... with a gospel feel to it? Gospel's all about love anyway, isn't it? Would it make you feel like a sinner? Mr. Charles, I love the Lord, the Lord loves me. But I ain't no hypocrite. Hello. You know, it's hard to fool me... but it's impossible to fool the Almighty, ain't it? RAY: Why don't we rehearse the song a little bit? MARY ANN: Okay. Boss, we got to go. Go ahead. I'll be with you in a minute. RAY: I just really feel your spirit. JEFF: Boss, are you sure? Let's go. [Ray singing soulful tune] You're amazing. So are you, baby. Come sit next to me. So, what do you think? [Knocking on door] JEFF: Ray, telephone. RAY: Take a message. It's Della Bea. Damn it. Tell her I'm busy. Come on, man, I ain't lying to Bea. -Is that the wife? -Shut up. I'll be there in a second. Don't mess with this junk, all right? All it'll do is make you sick. Does he have all his fingers and toes? Yes, he does. Can he.... Can he see? Yes. -You want to hold him? -No, I can't. -Come on, Ray. -I wouldn't know what to do. That's what you came here for. Use this hand to hold his head. Okay. Right there. [Baby crying] [Della shushing] That's your daddy. He ain't no bigger than a loaf of bread. Thank you. He's not my gift to you, Ray. He's your son. You know I'm gonna take care of both of you, right? I love you. I love you, too, Ray. But there's something I got to say. I know you're a working musician... but don't bring the road into our home again. The home I'm making for you and our children. Bea, I promise I won't do that. -It's just there's some things-- -Don't say no more. I ain't no fool. You know, you're the only woman I'll ever love. RAY: Mama! Mama, help! Mama, help, please! I need you! Mama, help! [Cow mooing] [Cricket chirps] [Cricket chirping] I hear you, too, Mama. You're right there. ARETHA: Yes, I am. Why are you crying, Mama? 'Cause I'm happy. JEFF: It's Uncle Jeff! Got my camera! JEFF: Sarah! Come on in. Put the flowers right there behind them. JEFF: All right, big smiles, everybody. [Upbeat jazzy song playing] Hi, Junior. Come on, Ray, let's get this boy home so he can eat. I have those cookies you like. We try to make it through these cracker speed traps... we'll be a little late. RAY: Yeah, just stay within the limits. JEFF: All right. Why don't we get that spot in Memphis? We could have our own place. Baby, I'm not leaving Houston. I bet she don't do this. Baby, hold on. Goodbye don't mean gone, okay? I'm not gonna leave my family. Okay, baby, okay. No need to get sore. How about we give me a little more to do in the show? How about a solo? You just don't stop, do you? Look, I'm going up to New York to do some publicity. You stay here, find some material... and when I get back, we can talk about it. Okay. [Upbeat jazzy song continues] [All cheering and clapping] RAY: I dig New York. Everybody here's making their own sound. JERRY: They loved it. Ray, they loved you. We're gonna get the cover of Billboard. I want to do a session while I'm here. How about tomorrow? -You got the band here? -Yeah. Everybody except Mary Ann... because I need a different background. I've been hearing this thing in my head... like a dance between a man and three women. Sounds fun. Can I watch? It's a dance of voices, Ahmet. What do you have in mind? Like three Mary Anns? No. That's too smooth. I need something that's more raw. The Cookies. What about The Cookies? Yeah, Cookies are sweet. [Lively music] Jesus, he's on fire. Maybe we should sign these girls up. If I know Ray, we won't get a chance. TOM: It doesn't get better than that. RAY: I love it! RAY: We gonna put it out like that. I never got a record in one take before! You Cookies sound sweet. When it's happening, baby, it just feels right. I know what you mean. I got the shivers in this studio tonight. That's 'cause they ain't paid the heating bill. RAY: I have a question for all of you: How would you like to go on the road with me? [Screaming excitedly] How much you gonna pay us? -Ahmet takes care of all of that. -You mean he don't listen to you? You better know he does. Don't worry about it. Brother Ray'll take care of you. My mama taught me to take care of myself. ls your mother here? -No, she's not, but I speak for us. -No, you don't. Okay, Speak for Us, how about $20 a week? -$20 a week is good. -We'll take $40. Each. RAY: $40 each? MARGlE: You heard me. No. How about $25? We'll take $30. I have to say yeah before you talk me out of my drawers. MARGlE: $30 a week! Deal? Oh! Yeah. Margie, right? RAY: Look, Margie, from now on... you guys are going to be called The Raelettes. Does that mean we have to "Let Ray"? -What am I going to do with you? -I'm sure you'll think of something. PAT: $30 a week! MARGlE: We're going to be The Raelettes! [Playing classical piano music] [Girls chattering] JEFF: Fathead, come on, you're on the clock. Come on, Bob, you're late. RAY: Hold on, Jeff. Listen up. From now on, we're gonna sing four-part harmony. Ethel, you sing alto. Margie, you sing tenor. Pat, soprano, and Mary Ann, bass. I ain't no bass. I'm a soprano. I'll sing bass. Where we come from, we can sing anything. We're talking about singing, sugar, not hog calling. That's cold. Who are you calling a hog? If the corncob fits.... You better shut your mouth before you get-- RAY: What is all the cackling for? Mary Ann, sweetheart, I wrote something special for you: a solo. A solo? Come on down here, let me play it for you. [Slow piano music playing] [Singing soulful song] JEFF: Ethel! Come here and see this new piano Ray got. -It's called a Wurlitzer. -A what? JEFF: You got to see this thing. It's out of sight. Baby, I got your drink here for you. MARGlE: Don't play that. RAY: She want me to play something else. [Soulful singing continues] We got some hell going on, gentlemen! Now, this is a car. This is a car! Looks like a damn Wieniemobile! MARGlE: Lookie here! JEFF: Let's take it for a spin. RAY: Since I'm the boss, you got to let me drive. Don't hit nothing, Ray. -You okay? -Yeah. -What room are you in? -69. Honey, you are so nasty. That's what I love about you. MARGlE: No, seriously, what room are you in? RAY: I'm in 626. MARGlE: 624. MARGlE: Baby, I can't wait till we get to your room. Here's 626. Right here. -Where's the key? -You have to get it. I have to find it? -Is that it? -It might be. MARGlE: I'm not going to unbuckle your pants yet. Let's get you in. RAY: Miss Mary Ann Fisher, ladies and gentlemen. FATHEAD: Wait till you see what's in the goodie bag. RAY: Goodie bag? FATHEAD: Gonna fly you to the moon, baby. Let me get your hand, Ray. FATHEAD: There go three. That's for you. I thought you was my friend. The weight is off. Don't start with me, Ray. -The weight is off. -It ain't off. When you get high and try to cop... dealers will spank your ass. You need discipline. You know what? I ain't messing up my high tonight... sitting here with you, arguing about nothing. Look, Fathead, just tie me off. Come on, Fathead. Take care of your bad self, you know so damn much. FATHEAD: Later, Margie. MARGlE: Bye, Fathead. Damn. Ain't nothing free in the world but Jesus. [Ray gasps in fear] Yeah? What do you want? RAY: Do me a favor, sweetheart, and pick that up for me. RAY: You're going to have to get me off. I'll do it, if you let me try some. This ain't for no little girls. I ain't no little girl! I understand. It's just that this stuff will take you places... you don't want to go. I want to share that with you. Listen to me! If I ever hear about you doing drugs... you're through, you hear me? You believe that more than you believe in Jesus! Don't say that, Ray. I watch your show every single night. And every night is new to me. Maybe because it's new to you. It's like you live every single word... and then you bend some crazy note... and damn if you don't break my heart. You got genius, baby. I just want to be a part of that. [inviting jazzy song] [Singing inviting jazzy song] Look at him. Look at his knees shaking. He's got that junkie itch. He's totally hooked. But listen to that sound. He's brilliant. You can never trust a junkie. What do you want me to do? Listen to him. [Continues singing inviting song] -Happy birthday! -Happy birthday, Ray. You know what to do. Take a deep breath. Go ahead. -He blow them out? -Every single one. [inviting jazzy song continues] [All cheering and clapping] I want to thank you so very much. Please, another round of applause for Miss Margie Hendricks. Thank you so much, and good night. MANAGER: You see what time it is? JEFF: What's the problem? The problem is on the contract. Ray! You still got 20 minutes left. RAY: What you want to do? That fool's holding us to every second of the contract. Go baby-sit him. I'll take care of it. It's okay. They say we got a little more work to do. That was the last song in the book. It's never the last song. Band, follow me and do what I do, say what I say. This is how we gonna do it. [Lively piano music playing] [Singing lively song] Where can I get that record from? I don't know. It doesn't exist yet. I'll tell Ray he should record it. [Lively song playing back] Yeah, that's it. I'm telling you, that is out of sight. That's a hit. It's fantastic. But what are we gonna do... with this? It's too damn long. Every night we play this, we bring the house down. It's guaranteed. Tom, cut the playback! Come on out here. Ray, you're probably right. I'm sure you're right. I've never heard a sound like this before. But how do we market it? We could cut the second verse, pop back into the chorus. You cut that, I'll cut you in half. All right, all right. We could split it up. Do a Side A/Side B type of thing. It's been done before. What the hell, right? It's sexual. It's just too damn sexual for kids. Let's do it. Yeah! That's why I love y'all. JERRY: All right. What the hell? It's Atlantic, right? We'll release it in the summer. There's less censorship. School's out. The kids are ready to kick loose. Tom, let's see if we can cut this pumpkin in two. Show me what your genius is all about. TOM: You got it, boss. You put one on Side A, another on Side B. That's out of sight. How you feeling? I feel groovy, baby. I'm talking about the junk. AHMET: It's starting to show. You're scratching all the time. You can't sit still. Have I ever missed a date? No, you never have. Who's the one who delivers a record in one take? AHMET: You deliver better than anybody I know... but I'm not talking to you as a businessman. AHMET: Now come on, listen to me. I'm worried about you. As a friend, I'm telling you, man, your slip is hanging. "Your slip is hanging." You been hanging out with us country boys too much. Don't worry about this. If this monkey gets too heavy on my back... I'll get an organ grinder and put him to work. MlLT: He's off the Chitlin' Circuit. Down Beat voted him Best Male Jazz Vocalist by a 2-to-1 margin. If you want him in Philadelphia... you're going to find him a bigger venue. What'd I Say! Forget second billing. Ray Charles headlines at $1,000 per... or no deal. Terrific. [Upbeat lively music] DELLA: I'm having second thoughts about this. I don't know nobody in L.A. RAY: Bea, I don't want my kids growing up in the South. L.A. is where a Negro can spread his wings and fly. DELLA: Ray, my whole family's in Texas. RAY: That's why we're moving to L.A. Tell the boys they can go ahead and start their vacation right now. JEFF: All right, boss. Once I get you inside. DELLA: Look at that huge coconut tree! That ain't no coconut tree. That's a palm tree. There's thousands of them. Here's the keys to your life, a brand-new life. Oh, Ray. Ray, this is too much. Have you seen the dining room? But, baby, it's October. RAY: I wanted to celebrate early, because the band will be playing... during the holidays. DELLA: You're unbelievable. RAY: Look at your presents. Baby, look at what Santa brought you. You must have been good. Go ahead! Christmas is early, baby! RAY: Go get it. RAY: What's he taken? DELLA: A guitar. RAY: A musician like your daddy. DELLA: Can you play? [Phone ringing] DELLA: What else you got? JEFF: Hello? How'd you get this number? How do you think I got it? Put Ray on the phone. Ray, telephone. Deal with it, man. Ray, it's important. Telephone. -I'll be right back. -All right. Who is it? [Whispering] It's Margie. Junior, come help your mama change your brother's diaper. RAY JR.: I don't want to go. I want to stay and open my presents. I don't want to go. DELLA: I don't care. Don't let me tell you twice. RAY: Hello. MARGlE: Hey, baby. Surprise! I came to L.A. to surprise you. Surprise me? Are you out of your mind? I'm with my wife and kids. On the road, I'm Mrs. Ray Charles. That's on the road. But, baby, come on, I got everything set up for us. Did you hear what I just said to you? Wait a minute, I got a bottle of Bols, and-- RAY: Shut up. Listen, we record in two weeks. I'll see you then. MARGlE: Wait a minute, Ray! RAY: Bye. Ray! [Soulful song] [Singing soulful song] Hold on, wait. RAY: Cut. You know that sounds off. The three-part harmony is off. Let's start it all over from the top with the band. [Singing] Whoa, pardner! What was that? TOM: I knew you'd like that. It's an eight-track. We can record each part separately. Whoa, Nellie! I can't wait to see that. RAY: What's so funny? MARGlE: Nothing, "pardner." Margie's drunk. Jeff? Go home and sleep it off. Let me take you home. No. I'll leave when I'm good and ready! She's good and ready right now. Why don't you make me leave, sucker! Teach you to treat me like some piece of meat! I ain't shutting up! -Should we get in there? -No. RAY: Get them all out, now. You'll have to make me leave! You know what? Get all of them out of here. You're a cold-ass bastard! Let go of me, Jeff! You're a cold-ass bastard! He wouldn't spit on me if my ass was on fire! Damn right I wouldn't. MARGlE: Put me down, Jeff! Damn it! You dropped your shoe. Come on, let's get back to work. RAY: Tom, this is what I want. We'll lay my vocals down... and finish the harmony parts. How will we do the harmonies, Ray? You sent the girls home. I know what I did. Let me take care of that. Turn that eight-track on, and I'll do the girls' parts myself. And go out and find me an "Oh, Johnny" girl. One minute. What the hell's an "Oh, Johnny" girl? I think I've got an idea. [Singing soulful song] [Singing in female voice] MILT: The sky's the limit, Ray. I got you a $5,000-a-night raise. They'll up you to 15 per. Rehearsal in 1 0 minutes. Jeff, could you get me some cigarettes? Okay, boss. Fifteen per? Your contract with Atlantic is expiring in four months. I got the contract with me. They're going to double my royalties. Before we jump back in that pond... I thought I'd find out what else was out there. I had a very productive chat with ABC-Paramount yesterday. ABC? Who told you to do that? Atlantic is family, just like the Shaw Agency. My job is to get you the best deal possible. ABC is very interested. No. How interested? How about a $50,000 advance each year for three years? You produce your own records. They'll deduct recording costs and give you... 75%. Ahmet and Jerry are flying in tonight so... will you put them off until I can talk things out with ABC? My mama said, ain't nothing wrong with talking. SAM: Enough of the formalities. Let's go back into the office, Ray. I hope I can call you Ray. I want you to be comfortable here. I'll tell you something, everything is gonna be better at ABC. Moving from an indie to a major... means you can sell a lot more records... as well as attract much larger crowds, both white and Negro. Mr. Clark, I've been at Atlantic for so long... I just want to give them a chance to at least match the offer. Certainly. But I doubt they'll be able to. We're giving you a state-of-the-art deal. Since I'm producing my own records, I was wondering if I could... own my masters, too. Ray, we've never done that before. No record company has. I think I'm going to have to have it that way... for me to leave Atlantic Records. JERRY: Ahmet and I believe we're family at Atlantic. Obviously, you don't! Ahmet wouldn't believe it. JERRY: You know what he said? He said... you would never turn your back on us. Never for a schlockmeister like Sam Clark! That's rich. Sam Clark's a corporate slug... who wouldn't know the difference between Earl Hines and Art Tatum! We let you grow here, Ray. Nobody's taking credit for �our talent, but we nourished it. We let you do your thing. God damn it! We deserve better than this. Don't think I don't appreciate everything you guys have done. I'm very proud of the work that we've done here together. Atlantic has done pretty good money-wise on my records, right? Yes, we've done very well. You were the ones that taught me that making a record is business... and find the best business deal you can. Seventy-five cents of every dollar, and owning... my own masters is a pretty damn good deal. Can you match it? Ray, we would love to match it, but we just can't. That's a better deal than Sinatra gets. I'm very proud of you. Looks like those boys are going to get a taste of country dumb. He'll be all right. You guys always do find the best. [Slow instrumental music playing] [Singing sentimental song] Listen to that crap. Thought you said that ABC wasn't going to force nothing on him. They didn't. It was Ray's idea. Something new. What are we then, Jeff? Something old? Yeah, what about us? We got to eat, too. [Continues singing sentimental song] [People cheering and whistling] RAY: It's a hit record. What is wrong with that? REPORTER: Critics say you've gone middle-of-the-road. The orchestra, the choir, The Perry Como Show? If I feel the music, that means it's real. No, it ain't. Ray Charles is a sellout. The blind Liberace, leaving those Rocking Chair roots behind. Quincy Jones. Can we get a picture of these two? -Six-nine! -Hey, boy. Look, this interview is over. REPORTER: I'd love to get you two together. QUlNCY: Some other time. Look at you. How's it going, man? You look good. RAY: Let me look at you. You look good, too. You hear what they're saying about me? That I can't do it no more. I've gone middle-of-the-road. QUlNCY: So crank out another hit. Let me tell you something, it ain't easy to keep on being greezy, kid. RAY: Where you blow in from? Paris. RAY: Bonjour. QUlNCY: Yeah, man. France is where it's at. Yeah. All that stuff you've been playing is really out of sight. We gotta record something together. People will really dig it. Where you going after the Festival? I go to D.C., Richmond, Virginia, Georgia. Once you get the record out there, �ou gotta sell it. The South, man? I'm not doing that no more. Come on, kid, that's where the money is, baby. When I left Seattle with Hamp... we went down there. It felt like I walked into a prison cell. A black man is a "boy" in Mississippi, right? Even if he's 80 years old. I'm never playing to Jim Crow again. Ever. If that's what you feel, baby. I'm serious, Ray. We gotta do something. Well, you know, what the hell, man. You're just going to leave a lot more money on the table for me. QUlNCY: You're welcome to it, man. [Piano music playing] You ready to work? Work on what? Get over here, you gotta help me with this. Percy just sent me some new music. [Margie vomiting] Know what they're saying about me? Said I've lost something, I've gone middle-of-the-road. They may as well say the same about you. You were the soul of this band. Now every time �ou're around, �ou're drunk. Drunk soul of a blind junkie. What a lovely couple. Why don't you just get out of here? I ain't drunk, Ray. I'm pregnant. That's right. I'm having your baby. You ain't really.... You can't do that. I'm gonna have to talk to the doctor. You gotta get rid of it. My God! What, because I'm not your precious Bea? I'm not good enough to have this baby? You lay up in my bed every night. My bed! I'm gonna have this baby, Ray. No, Ray! No! RAY: Just listen to me. You know I care about you. I won't let nothing happen to you. -I'll pay for everything. -No! MARGlE: It'll cost you more than money. I want you to leave her, Ray. Come be with our baby. You out of your damn mind. You knew the rules when you got into this. You know goddamn well I ain't gonna leave my family. Leave your family? You are a damn fool, you know that? Between the dope and the music and me... you already done left your damn family! And the sad part about it is, Ray, �ou don't even know it. You know what? From now on, it's strictly business between you and me. That's it. Keep that anger. [Singing fast-paced song] [Singing angrily] [Fast-paced song continues] Ray, it's Sam. Can you hear me? It's Sam! Hit the Road is our second number one. Yeah. ABC is taking out ads in all the trades. And congrats on your Grammy nomination. No, I know you're going to win. Hey, you feeling all right? Come on, baby, be happy. You're doing good. [Drunkenly] Thank you, Sam. I really am happy about that. Yeah. I'll stop by Jeff's room and get my money on my way out. Ray. Margie, you ain't gotta leave, baby. I'm on your hit record. If I'm ever going to go solo, then now's the time. I don't want you.... I don't want you to go solo. Ray, for once, I'm doing something for me. You remember the hummingbird? What? The hummingbird, Bea. I don't want you to go. [Melancholic instrumental music] ARETHA: Somebody'll fetch you when your bus gets to St. Augustine. When you get there, show them this sign... and tell them you're Ray Charles Robinson. And don't eat them sandwiches I made all at once. Don't make me go away. I'll keep up with the normal kids. I'll be good, just like George. This ain't got nothing to do with George. I've taken you as far as I can. ARETHA: Them teachers at that blind school can teach you things I can't. You need an education. -I don't want no education! -Don't say that! I don't! I want to stay with you! Stop it! I won't have you living hand-to-mouth like me, you hear? If you want to do something to make your mama proud... promise me you'll never let nobody turn you into no cripple. ARETHA: You won't become no charity case. You'll stand on your own two feet. I promise. I love you, baby. I'm so proud of you. [Sobbing] PROTESTORS: No more segregation! [Police siren wailing] PROMOTER: Welcome back to Augusta, Ray! Good to see you. Do you believe in the protest, Ray? Get out of here! Ray, I'm sorry about this. Hurry on up inside. We got refreshments waiting. PROTESTOR: Mr. Charles! You know tonight's show is segregated? The dance floor is whites only. Negroes can't leave the balcony. That's how it is, man. This is Georgia. You think we don't know that? Negroes are persecuted in this state every day! Ain't nothing I can do about that. I'm an entertainer. We all play Jim Crow down here. Right. Now get out of here, boy. It doesn't have to be that way. You could change things... right here and now! I'm sorry, son. Ain't nothing I can do. You hear that, boy? That's the way things are. Now get your black ass out, and take that trash with you! Hold on. He's right. Get them on the bus. JEFF: You sure? RAY: Get them back on the bus! Y'all heard Ray! Back on the bus! Are you serious? Get them on the bus. I can't do nothing here. Ray, you know me. I'm not gonna lose money just because you suddenly got religion. Ain't nothing I can do. PROMOTER: We have a contra�t. You break it, I'll sue you! PROMOTER: I'll win! RAY: You gotta do what you gotta do. I'll win big! I'll own your ass, Ray! [Protestors yelling] Thank you, Mr. Charles. You could be the first. No, thank you, son. You were right. You're right. You'll never work Georgia again! MlLT: He filed a lawsuit and it's more than a fine, Ray. This guy's got juice. He can get you barred from... ever playing Georgia again. But he's willing to drop the suit if you'll make up the gig. Not if it's segregated. I admire what you're doing, but you can't afford this. Georgia is our highest-grossing state. I'm not playing any Jim Crow joints ever again, you got that? Yeah. I got it. Jeff, get those people in here so we can rehearse. [Jazzy music] [People cheering and whistling] Go ahead and dance! Let's dance, everybody! Let's dance now! -You okay? -Yeah. What's going on? Just kids onstage dancing. Let them dance. That's what they're here for. Please don't hurt them! Just keep dancing! Keep going! [Singing upbeat song] [People cheering] COP 1: Mr. Charles, it's Western Union! We have a telegram for you. COP 1: You have to sign for it, sir. RAY: I'm coming. Indianapolis police. Got a report of loud music coming from here. COP 2: Where do you think you're going, pal? I'm just going to the bathroom. Handcuff this son of a bitch. Recognize this, Ray? Heroin's a felony. It ain't like I'm dealing it, man. I'm not hurting nobody. You're hurting everybody. Your jungle music is poisoning... our kids' minds. I'm gonna put your black ass away forever. You have to understand. I got a wife, kids. I got responsibilities. Why don't you tell that story to these people. Bring them in! REPORTER 1: Was it a setup? REPORTER 2: How long you been on heroin? REPORTER 3: Come on. What did they charge you with? [Reporters clamoring] [Bluesy music] [Singing bluesy song] -Hi, baby. -David. RAY: Bea, he can stay. DELLA: No. Baby, come on. RAY: Bea? DELLA: What? -Since I got back-- -Since you got out. Since I got here, you haven't said more than two words to me. Ray, what am I supposed to say? My words don't mean much to you anymore. Maybe they never did. -Come on, Bea, you know I love you. -Are you gonna stop then? Bea, what you don't understand... is there's a lot of mean-spirited people out there. Yeah. Ray? I had to bring Junior home from school today... because of what the other kids said. They got mean-ass kids here. We should move to Beverly Hills. No, Ray, we're not moving. It's not about where we live. It's about what you're doing to yourself. Those boys worship �ou. You want them to end up using that poison, too? Bea, that's not fair. What's not fair, Ray? That's a low blow. RAY: Don't jive me, Milt. Don't jive me, man! RAY: Really? Good. Tell Sam I said thank you. RAY: All right, then. What, Ray? What? Come on, now. Tell me what happened. ABC got the case dropped. The police didn't have a warrant. They bought them off. Damn it, Bea, do you want me to go to prison? No. I want you to stop lying to yourself... and they are making that impossible. You don't understand. Then make me understand! When I walk out that door, I walk out alone in the dark! RAY: I'm trying to do something nobody's ever done... in music and business. But I can't do it if I'm alone everywhere I go. I don't want to be alone here, Bea. Not in my own home. Bea, if you don't understand me... then who will? [David crying] I don't know, Ray. David? I'm coming! Mama's coming! Ray, we pull you out of the fire, and you want country music? I've sung country music all my life. I used to play with the Florida Playboys. We made a big investment in you and it's paying off handsomely. For both of us. We don't want to lose �our fan base. You got a point there, but I actually think... that we have more to gain... than we do to lose. Ray, it's a bad idea. When I came to ABC, you put in the contract... that I can choose my own music. You want to read that paragraph? RAY: It's on Page 3. I don't need to see it. [Upbeat jazz instrumental music] JOE: Good evening, Saint Louis. JOE: It's time for the main attra�tion. The innovator of soul. The genius himself. Ray Charles! [People cheering] Thank �ou so much. I know that a lot of y'all don't know... that I was brought up in the South. Every time �ou turn on the radio there, you hear the Grand Ole Opry. That's what I grew up singing, so I hope �ou don't mind... I want to sing something to give �ou a taste of my country roots. MAN: Unchain My Heart! Georgia On My Mind! The lights up top and on the mezzanine... let's take everything down and hit Ray with a follow spot. Do it on my count. [Singing slow country song] In five, four.... [Car horn honking] RAY JR.: Jeff's here. Dad, if you can't see, how can you choose the right color socks? RAY: I'll show you. Let me show you something. See? Right here? RAY: The two, I got it sewn in thick, so I can feel it. RAY: Two is brown. RAY: One is black. Three is blue. Where's four? Nowhere. There ain't no four. You're right. [Continues singing slow country song] [Audience cheering] JEFF: Guys, we got 1 0 minutes to load out! Change back at the hotel. They bought that country jive hook, line and sinker. Ray, man, you're amazing. You know why they like country music? The stories. They got great stories. Hey, Joe. Ray, meet Joe Adams. Hal Ziegler hired Joe... as the announcer for the rest of the tour. I know you, Mayor of Melody. I listened to your radio show in L.A. in the '50s. We've both come a ways since then. What was that counting you were doing back there? Cueing down the lights. That shuts up the audience... so you can sing your ballad instead of having to scream it. I'll be damned. Who told you to do that? No one. It just needed to be done. That's what I'm talking about. I like to hear a person say: "It needed to be done"... as opposed to a person saying, "It ain't my job." Tell me about Central Avenue. I know �ou know Jack Lauderdale. Hello, New York! Hello, Boston! JOE: Hello, Saint Louis! Good evening, San Francisco! Ray, I got some good news for you. We got the cover of Cash Box. JOE: "The nation's hottest album: Modern Sounds of Country Western." -You are hotter than hell. -That's what they say. Your albums are going through the roof... your concerts are always selling out. You'll need shelters for your money. You're in a new tax bracket. JEFF: Keep your drawers on, Fathead! I got the instruments! Jeff, Joe was in the film Carmen Jones. Who was the director again? Otto Preminger. He was also on Broadway with Lena Horne. She was the star. I was supporting. ls that a fa�t? JOE: Prepare for an extraordinary evening of music. Perhaps the most innovative, unique and energetic musical voice today. Please welcome to the stage.... It is my pleasure.... Please welcome the one-of-a-kind.... I present Mr. Ray Charles! [Singing lively country song] [Joe speaking in French] [Joe speaking in Italian] [Joe speaking in Japanese] [Audience cheering] JOE: There's a park at the end of the street. JOE: You can see the L.A. basin from there. JOE: Even Beverly Hills doesn't have these views. RAY: How does it look, Bea? Do you like it? DELLA: I don't know. I haven't seen it. RAY: You got to like it. JOE: Voilà. This foyer is designed to impress anybody who walks through the door. It has a big winding staircase, just like Gone With the Wind. We should get our portraits painted, like Rhett and Scarlett. Bea, bring him in here. Wait till you hear what's waiting in the living room. RAY: What is it? I had them build you a solid marble fireplace, two stories high. Hot damn! How do you like it? It's awful big. JOE: Sure is: 8,500 square feet. RAY: Biggest house in the neighborhood. JOE: So, does this meet with your approval? Man, this is a palace. JOE: You think this is big? Wait until �ou see 30,000 square feet of RPM Incorporated. RAY: Yeah, headquarters! This is it, Ray. Your brand-new recording studio. Did you get everything I asked for? Totally state-of-the-art. Tom Dowd built... an eight-track mixing console, two recorders, the works. This room is bigger than most people's houses. Your private bathroom is to your left. Behind you is my adjoining office. JOE: Your private bar is to your left. Bottle of Bols in the center. RAY: You know me pretty good. JOE: If you run out, shout, I'm right next door. RAY: This is nice, right here. -It's the house that Ray built. -Yes, it is. [Soulful song] DELLA: Ray Junior, slow down! This ain't no baseball diamond! HOUSEKEEPER: Charles residence. Mr. Charles? Bring that boy over here! I got a hot dog with his name on it! Hello. Yes, I know who you are. What? Oh, God, no. I'll get on a plane and be there as soon as I can. What happened? Margie's dead. Oh, God! How? She overdosed. I didn't start her, Bea. I didn't let her do dope around me. I wouldn't let that happen. I'm sure, Ray. I'm sure you set a fine example. What about her baby? You knew? His name is Charles Wayne. He was born October 1, in New York City. He's 3 years old. The baby's fine. He's at her sister's. I'll start sending them some money. You don't have to. I send them money every month. [Ray sobbing] JOE: In five minutes, Mr. Charles will be here. He'll be ready to go. JOE: The charts Jeff is handing out... should be turned in at the conclusion of.... You're late, that's a $50 fine. I ain't late. I give them a 1 0-minute grace period, Joe. 2:05. He's late. He'll be charged $50. What? Where's Ray? You don't have to talk to Ray, you're talking to me. I'll talk to whoever I damn well please... and it sure as hell ain't you. FATHEAD: Jive jerk. Ray, this fool Joe Adams is trying to fine me for being late. What time did you get here? What? Just now. The band's still setting up. -Jeff don't-- -I'm not Jeff. That's a fact, Jack! Ray, you said the band was my thing. It is. Then, Fathead, go on back to rehearsal. [Scoffs] You know how it is, you've been there. JEFF: Go on now. Let me handle this. Fathead, go on now. What the hell is going on, Ray? I'm not doing anything I haven't been asked to. Ray's running a business. He shouldn't have to waste time hearing why people were late. I'm not talking to you, Joe. I'm talking to Ray. I know you think I'm soft on the band... but those cats would do whatever I ask. If you come in with this "running a business" crap... you'll lose some good people. There are musicians waiting in line to play with Ray. Not for long, once they get a taste of you. Ray, you're the leader. Be one! Come on. Things have changed, Jeff. It ain't like the days of The Chitlin' Circuit. If you weren't busy building a bowling alley, you'd see that. So you know about that? I know about everything. I'm just trying to figure out how you did it. You think I'm stealing from you? If the Shaw Agency gives you a cut of the 1 0% I pay them... I might as well keep the goddamn money in my pocket. Leave us alone. We need to talk. Ray? You can step outside, Joe. I'll be in my office. I know that jealous bastard planted that lie in your head... but I have never stolen from you, Ray, and I never will. I got a small business loan... and Milt Shaw gave me a little extra, but I'm no thief. Then what about that? RAY: A promoter swearing you did side deals with him to split my overages! How could you do that to me? We've been through so much, we're like brothers. You know what? If we were like brothers... why are you paying Joe more than you're paying me? Damn that! You broke my heart. You know what, Ray? You broke mine a long goddamn time ago! Well, then there it is. You know something, Ray? You're going to get yours one day. And I pray God has mercy on your soul, you son of a bitch! [Door slamming shut] Everything all right, Ray? How the hell do you think it is? [Car horn honking] Go tell him. Tell him! Dad, I made the all-star team! The game's on Thursday. That's great. Damn! I'm not gonna be in town. I'm on tour. What if I buy �ou guys new uniforms? Tell the coach I don't care how much they cost. -Okay. -All right. Take your dad's briefcase inside. The plane to Montreal leaves at 11:00. I'll pick you up at 8:30. Did you hear what Ray Junior said to you? You know how much making the all-star team means to him? I know, but I got things on my mind. We had to fire Jeff. -What? -He was stealing. Jeff? I don't believe it. We're better without him. [Singing soulful song] [Jazzy instrumental music] CUSTOMS AGENT: Excuse me! U.S. customs! We'll need identification, please. CUSTOMS AGENT: You just arrived from Montreal? ls there a problem? We were alerted there might be drugs on this plane. That's outrageous! I'm calling our lawyer. No lawyers at international checkpoints. We'll have to search everyone on this plane. Mr. Charles, we'd like to start with �ou. I'd like to see me Pharaoh. - Any sign of her? - None. - She must have given up. - Uh uh. Not convinced. Let's make it home alive then I'll be convinced; time to wake Summerlee... -...and for us to get going. - Give him a minute. He could use the rest. Nonsense my child I'm as fit as a fiddle. Of course you are, let's go. Are you all right? Just tweaked my back should settle in a minute. Oh he's all right, aren't you Summerlee? I tell you what Veronica and I will take point you watch our backs. In case that things still out there. Thank you John, you can count on me. Good man. Run Summerlee! Move it! Come on. come on. come on! We are Ramses risen from the dead. Osiris himself kneeled before us. Bidding us return from the underworld to lead our people into a new age of conquest, of glory. Blessed by Ra our power is infinite. Demon you are cursed not blessed. Devil - perversion of darkness. Now.now who had who buried alive? No killing her Ramses that was the deal. But of course not that would be barbaric. A conscious now from the monster who murdered his own father. - What? - Oops. - Murder? Why do I get the feeling we backed the wrong horse. I'll see your corpse rot for this brother. You won't be seeing anything for much longer dear sister. Perhaps you should have let me kill her. You evil son of a bitch. I am Pharaoh beyond good and evil. Here, ample compensation for your trouble. and your weapons. This has not been a good day. Ramses manipulated us from the moment we dug him up. Yeah, that was our first mistake. We can't leave him in power. Was I at the wrong party or did we actually have a choice in the matter? - We have to go back. - Wait Challenger how do you plan to dethrone him? - I don't know. - Brilliant! - Why didn't we think of that? - Do you realize what we've done? Yes thank you I am well aware. All I am saying is there's some things you can't undo. He's right Marguerite we've got to try. How? In case you've forgotten he took our guns. We'd be lucky to make it back to the treehouse alive. Let's at least rearm ourselves before we play cavalry. It would be too late by then as long as Nefertiti is alive she's a danger to him. - He's right we don't have a choice. - Fine! You two want to go off and get yourselves killed have fun. It's a matter of honor. What good is honor to you if you're too dead to enjoy it? Hey! I'm not going with you. I'm not. George Don Quixote, as if there aren't enough ways to die out here already. - We'll never out run it. - I'm slowing you down. - No, I didn't mean it like that. - No time to argue people. Roxton what on earth are you doing? We're going to need a tourniquet. - For what? - Blood it's the strongest scent of all. - There's got to be another way. - Well I'd do it myself... I'm sorry Summerlee but it's you she wants. I'm afraid he's right Professor. The more blood around the less likely she'll be able to pick up the real trail. It's your curse you're just too charming; - ...you're her man. - Just do it. Hot isn't it? Not exactly the kind of stones I was hoping for. Thanks for coming back to warn us. You kidding? It had nothing to do with you. Really? If I show up without the two of you what was I supposed to tell the others? More trouble that it's worth. If it means anything, I'm proud of you. Thank you - it doesn't. Uh.uh not that way. You can't be serious. We can be the hunter or the hunted; it's your choice. I don't see Nefertiti. He must have sealed her inside the pyramid. * - Let's go find out. - No, first things first. Let's get our weapons back then we can dig her out. - She could be dead by then. - She's probably dead now. Come on. Why do I bother? Just a few more inches. Help would be appreciated. That's it we've almost got it. Well what are you waiting for? - Ladies first. - Age before beauty. - Well technically I was born in 1895 so. - Don't make me hurt you. There she is. Its okay we're here to help. What is it? Who's there? Three people who've made a terrible mistake. Just get her unraveled so we can get out of here. I don't think so. I suspected something when my guards failed to return. Maybe they took a wrong turn. - Seal them in! - No! Save it, its solid stone and a foot thick. Wait it's ...a foot thick. The tomb is sealed, it's air tight. There is another exit for the Pharaohs spirit to pass beyond. Well, anytime now. The way will be revealed after death. Mind if we don't wait that long? Sorry about the climb Professor. At least this is one terrain she is not suited for. We'll soon find out. - Well maybe she's given up. - Would you? Her babies are dead. Dammit what's it gonna take to lose that thing? Me. You can't be serious? Oh yes I am child. It's my scent the mother has in her brain. No reason to sacrifice the two of you as well. Professor you're coming with us. I'll carry you if I have to. We're all in this together. I wish you'd reconsider my plan. Dying is not part of the plan, let's go. Dammit, there's no way around it no way over it. Apparently your right John, we are all in this together. Anything yet? Yeah, the crops came in nicely. Oh a few wars won woman and slaves taken; man stuff mostly. You? Nothing that says exit. Can you give us a better idea of what we're looking for? It won't be a single word. It's not something meant to be read by the living. Great. How do you talk to the dead? In a prayer. Yeah a prayer, but to who? Apis guide to the underworld. Is this guy tall,thin, short what? He's a bull. Got him Come and read this. Ra's love will deliver you. It's the same here. It's on all of them. Yes this one too. That's what these remind me of the mirrors in a periscope. But Ra's love. What does Ra love? The sun. Get the torches bring them to the mirror. Hold them close. It worked. - Ramses.Ramses? - He's gone. We're too late; my people are doomed. Not if we can stop him. Impossible, you don't know his power. We've seen worse. Even if I return, he'll divide my people with civil war. He holds the scepter of Ra. Listen lady nobody buries me alive and gets away with it. We'll have to travel quickly. I can see shadows, light. Your retinas are seared. Do you think you can keep up with us? If there's a chance to save my people. Let's see, Ramses has our guns... magic scepter; armed guards. We have a blind woman and two swords any ideas? Maybe, give me a minute. Well the wind shifted our scent. She's confused but not for long. Marvelous creature really. A bit too stubborn from my liking. You were right I should have told Ned. You'll get your chance. You have a plan? Seems you were right Professor. There is only one way to stop her. What? There that should do it. This is the largest one I could find. Yes, that'll do. There's not much time. Get it up. Let me see your arm. You need more blood; anything for the cause. Not this time; just your bandage. Summerlee? Come on. There, I'd say you never looked better. And just in time. Stop Ramses I command you! I too have returned from the dead brother. Down! You have returned for the last time you blind pretender. Seize her! Don't tell me another surprise return. A resurrection really. - You should have stayed buried. - I could say the same about you. I command you Ra show them your power. The light is mine! - Now! - No! Queen. Well forgive me if I don't find it amusing. - Oh you wouldn't precious one. - Malone. Well let's face it Marguerite he had you fooled. While you two saw right through him; please. Ned? You're back. Yeah we were out with a Pharaoh. - I'll tell you all about it later. - Ned wait - I ah... - What, something wrong? No. I missed you. Yeah? Yeah. Ah there she is; the woman who would be Queen. So you've heard. Congratulations ever heard of knocking? I guess that Pharaoh guy well... he was pretty sweet on you huh? You find something humorous in that? Me? No. It may interest you to know that some men... appreciate the finer qualities in a woman. Well, do tell. Oh a certain air of distinction; a noble bearing of gentility... a sensuous passion ... smoldering beneath a thin veil of civility. I see. Of course it takes a special man to ... appreciate these things. Apparently. It's just a damn shame it took a ... power mad homicidal maniac to bring out the best in you. Well so much for civility. Why are you here? I just wanted to say hello. Consider it said; anything else? Yes... welcome home. * Pretty good fella, but not good enough. - Homo! - Yeah, because I rule, basically... Shit bender. Ah, Kelly, you're stankin'! What about you, you sweaty fuck! Aargh! Get away, you scummer. Later then! What you think of that, then? Tone? What? Think of what? The moves... Me, Jonno and Kel worked it out. It's OK. Hey! Nothing to worry about, dude. Yeah? Yeah. It's all right. Everything's cool. - Hi, Maxxie. - Hey. Hi. Who's that? That's Tony. What's up with you? I had a traumatic subdural haematoma with motor and perceptional complications. Are you mental? Yes. I'd still give you one. Totally. He's well fit. Yeah, Queenie? Yeah. He's buff. Hey come on, Tone.

I wanna leave college and audition for musicals in London. You're getting qualifications and you're coming to me on the building. But how's a history A-level gonna help me be a builder? You'll be an educated builder. Dad, I want to be a dancer. They have dancing every Thursday down the centre. You love that. - No, but... - Pastimes. That's what we're into. - Dad... - The rest isn't for us. Get the dog. Taz. Fucking turd burglar. Watch out, Dale. Fucking dog! Quiet, boy. You got something to say, kidder? Say what I like.

Great. How are you, lad? Better, thanks. She's got warm hands. Oh, they're lovely and warm. Always say that. So you're all dancing the night away tonight, huh? Yeah... bit of a party! - It's not really a party. - Yeah, that's right. What party? Look, sorry, Tone. But your mum says we gotta take you home. Maybe your folks think it's a bit too soon to be going out. Fuck my folks. Where's Sid? He couldn't make it, mate. His dad made him stay in and... Mow the grass. Yeah, that's it. He's mowing the grass. He couldn't make it, Tony. All right? Sid couldn't make it... Hey! Hi, Sid! When are you coming to see me? Everyone's so lovely in Elgin. Here's my new friends, Rory and Lachlan. - All right, wee man? - Hello there, Sidney. Rory's going to let me blow his chanter later. It's easy. Ye just need to learn tae finger it. And I've already been beating Lachlan's bodhran. Magic! Aye! - What? ! - I'm not very good. Aye, ye are! Anyway, there's a present in there, Sid. And watch what I can do. Mighty fucking Scotland. Hoots! Don't you care what I want? ! Don't I get to decide? Yeah. You're gonna decide to be a builder who dances in his spare time. I don't want to be a fucking builder! - What's wrong with it? - Nothing. Nothing. I just... I can do this, Dad! You don't think I can do it, do you? No, lad. Fucking hell! Thanks, Dad.

Don't wanna go home. # Groove upon the party # Yo, when I'm cruising in my Lamborghini # The chicks see me, they go, # "Mmm, wow, he's so sexy" # And I might get my shot for the end of the night # Cos pussy is pussy and baby, you're pussy for life # I wanna fuck you, fuck you # You already know # I wanna fuck you, fuck you... # Argh! Ow! Oh... Fuckin' hell... Sorry. I gotta remember to stand pimp in these. What's happening, "blood"? I'm in for some serious slippy-slidey todger action at this party, man! It's not... really a party. Are you pissing me? It's the biggest night of the year. Everybody's going! Yeah, except Tony. Shame, man. It's gonna be... Tony can't go. Remember? Fuckers... Come on, mate. I told you to keep quiet about the sodding rave. And why are you dressed as a crack dealer? You think it's too much? If I'd just met you, I'd rather slit my wrists than give you one. That's because you don't give anyone one. Watch out or they'll take your tits into care. Because they don't get out enough. You geddit? Your tits... Hello, Mr Stonem. Wondered where you were. Thanks for bringing him back. That's all right. No problem. Maybe we'll pop round... tomorrow. Let's go get fucked. Are you not going to have anything, Tony? No. OK. So, um, what did you get up to today? He shouldn't be going out! He's wandering around, God knows where... We don't even know who he's with! He could have a bleed or a fit or... Yeah, Jim. He's here. Oh, fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. All right, all right. Just... for Christ's sake, eat something! Look, Mum's made it easy. It's all... lovely and... bite-sized. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Come on, let's talk about something else. Come on. Yeah, yeah. What do you want to talk about? Dirty jokes. What? Maxxie's mum says your jokes are filthy. You saw Jackie Oliver today? Jackie probably was thinking about someone else. Right, Anthea? Yeah, yeah... Anyway... This mate of mine's been going to the doctor. Who's that? Er, don't think you know him. Um, anyway he had to have some tests, had palpitations or something... So, he eventually goes back to the doctor to get the results and, er, the doctor says, "Sit down. I'm afraid there's good news and there's bad news. "The bad news is you've only got a month to live." My mate's like, devastated, he's gutted. But he pulls himself together and he says, "What's the good news?" And the doctor says, "See my new receptionist? "Blonde. Great arse. Huge tits. "Well, I'm fucking her." That's crap. Yeah... My name's Anthea Stonem. Thank you and good night. They'll take her tits into care... They're gonna... They don't get out enough! I got it! I got it! Look, I've told you before, he's not leaving college. That's it! You don't need to be such a monster man about it! Who's being a monster man? You is. What's eating you, you big old bully! ? Nothing! Nothing. Just leave it alone. He's not leaving, that's final. All right, Walter. Bandy... How you doin'? Only passable, Walter. It seems like my Dale has overstepped his mouth. Little misunderstanding, that's it. What have you gotta say, dildohead? Sorry, Mr Oliver. And...? Sorry, Max. He's baked a cake of remorse. Very nice. So we're all right then, Walter? Water under the bridge, Bandy. How's the wife? Oh, not bad. They gave her early release. Still gotta wear the electronic tag, of course. Bummer. And they've banned her for life from operating a concrete mixer or a cattle prod. It's probably for the best. Oh, Tony! For fuck's sake. Come on! Fucking hell. Get off! Oh, fuck. Tony? Are you all right? No. Nobody wants me to come out any more. Oh, fuck it. Come anyway. My dad won't let me go back to college. And mine won't let me leave. We're both bummed, bruv.

I can't keep him in. But... He's not right. Who is? Everything's mental. This competition last week. Fucking break-dancing chihuahua. I mean, what's it come to? Right. You never know what's gonna happen till you're sitting in a hospital. And I'm thinking, I've really, really fucked up here, because I'm supposed to stop this happening. And now I don't know where he is. Something happens, suddenly you've lost them. His friends'll look after him. What you on? Cass sent me a tab. She misses you, right? I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I go to see him. I went to see him. Well, I suppose you deserve some fun. Those guys just like my tits. Oh. Sweet. You're avoiding me. You make me think about him. You're not the only one, Chelle. I was there every day trying to get him to say something. And everybody really, really fucked up and I'm just trying to... And nobody comes but me cos it's so terrible. You should have fucking helped me. All right! When it happened... before the bus he was on the phone, ... he was on the phone I don't think he remembers. - But he said... - Chelle. Fuck's sake, I'm trying to tell you this! Oh, Jesus! Tony? Hello. Wait, I'll go back with you. Effy's taking me. I will remember everything. Where are you going? Not now, Sid! Got lost. Where do I fucking live? Walter will run him round in the morning. Look, don't worry yourselves, OK. She's a bit upset. Yeah. College starts today. He's in there, love. Talking, not shouting. OK. Lovely bit of cake, that. Young Dale's got the magic touch. He's got that all right. You're good enough. Yeah. I am. I'm bloody good. Get it from your old man, probably. Reckon? I'm artistic, yeah. Not as artistic as you, mind. Some things is just the way they are. Yup. I got lucky, didn't I? You didn't turn out like the fucking ASBO Army out there. No, Dad. I feel like taking some fucking credit for it. OK? I'm never gonna be a builder, Dad. You'll understand this one day, kid. You're everything I've got to show for my life. And I'm not ready for you to go, because I fucking love you too much. I'm an idiot, I know. I love you too, Dad. So if you're not coming building, back to college. Give me the last year. And then it's game on. All right? All right. Taz. On your bed. At least the sodding dog does what he's told. I can register if I write my name. It's more than that, Tony. It's not just signing your name. Then fucking help me! Or are you gonna be a complete fucking arse-wit like everyone fucking else I know? Whoa! He speaks. You gotta slow it down. Stop trying to write. It's just a shape your hand makes. Close your eyes and just kinda... dance it. Tone. Do I have to gay you now? Resync: Nathbot Who are you? Shit! Hang on... You're fucking crazy!

Yeah, she's just gone to get some stamps. Good timing. There you go. You're late today. Just felt my... Beeper go off. You... Sure it was your beeper? I got to go. What? Something wrong? Yeah, I just got another call from the dean. Apparently, matt and kelly's parents still haven't heard from them. Kids partying go incommunicado all the time. It's been 2 weeks, claudia. Must've been a hot party. They were checking in twice a week. Have you spoken to the new orleans police department? Yeah, they didn't come up with anything. You didn't force them to go to new orleans for their research. But I encouraged them to. They're my students, nigel. Can you try again, please? Okay. (phone ringing) { Advertisement } (professor richard:) the thing is, you see, Voodoo takes the basic tenets of catholicism And incorporates practices from a variety of african traditions: The fon, nago, ibos, the dahomeans, the congos -- Oh, and the senegalese. Professor richard, we really need to talk about matt and kelly. {pos(192,200)}Oh, right, right. You sounded concerned on the phone. Well, we haven't heard from them for a while. {pos(192,200)}Well, they've been doing some very good work. {pos(192,200)}They're very sharp. They came up with information {pos(192,200)}On haitian rituals that even I didn't know about. When was the last time you saw them? {pos(192,200)}Oh, a couple of weeks ago, maybe. (prof. Richard:) actually, I was quite surprised when you called. I assumed they'd left new orleans by now. (landlord:) they ain't been here for a while. {pos(192,200)}Still owe me for last month. {pos(192,200)}Kicked them out before with all the gris gris was hanging in there. {pos(192,200)}Gris gris? {pos(192,200)}Don't get me wrong. I like to pass a good time myself, But they done left the place beaucoups crasseux. Do you have any idea what he's talking about? You english? Uh huh. I had a friend move over there about 6 years ago named beau, Beau la croix. You know him? No, no, I don't think so. Huh? No. Your friend was into some strange stuff. What kind of strange stuff? See for yourself. (sydney:)looks like matt and kelly were getting into their research. Some of their notes. Have you any idea where they might have gone? If I did, I'd send the cops over to get my money. You see them, you tell them they want their camera back, They'd best clean this mess up and get me the rest of the rent. Camera? (landlord:)only thing worth a damn they left behind. But I'll be lucky if it and the security deposit cover this mess. There's a tape inside. How much? $500. $500 for a tape? Afraid it only comes as a set. Take a cheque? Only cash. Of course. (nigel:)did you see those mutton chops? The man looked like captain queeg. And then when he asked me if I knew beau -- beau? Just because I've lived in England is like asking me If I know the queen. Let's just hope there's something here we can use. Yeah, so do I for $500. Why don't you check these notes while I call claudia? (sydney:)looks like someone broke in, nigel. (sydney:) nigel. (nigel:) sorry. It doesn't look like there's anything missing. You all right? Did she see you take her brush? This woman needs a taste of the power of uto. (speaking in french) (kelly:) wait, let me get the camera steady. Okay, matt. (matt:) all right, it's Tuesday, November the twelfth. We're in the voodoo church of legba, duvall, louisiana. This is so awesome. Right up here, it's the cross of the uto. No one has seen it for over a hundred years And kelly and I might be the first ones to find it. So, man, we are so stoked. Now, we've got to go back to new orleans tonight To meet up with professor richard And then we'll be back here tomorrow morning. The last time professor richard met with them. We met this voodoo priest... (kelly:) matt. He told us not to say anything. Put the camera on the tripod for a second and come up here. Kelly's a little freaked out. I think she's taking her job a little too seriously. Yeah, why don't you tell us your theories, agent scully? I'm not being paranoid Because a lot of strange things have been happening lately. Right, like satan and his voodoo posse Might carjack us on the way home. It's not funny, matt. I'm serious. Kelly looked pretty scared. Cross of uto? Yeah. It's a voodoo icon, as I recall. I thought it was supposed to be in haiti. Yeah. I looked through matt and kelly's notes. They say there's a voodoo sect here that worships uto. Probably in that church that was on the video. What else? Well, there are two symbols that represent these sects, A spider and a serpent. The serpent represents the second in command, A sort of lieutenant. Then there's the leader, the... The sect's king. It's represented by a spider. I think we should head down to duvall, See what we can find out. Maybe we can find the church. Maybe we can find the priest they're talking about. I think we should run this tape by professor richard first, See what he has to say. (gasping in pain) Sydney? My shoulder. (gasping in pain) I believe your professor's in some discomfort. { Advertisement } (claudia:) hey, wait, where are you going? Come back. Don't I have to sign for this? (recording)the cellular customer you are trying to reach Is not available or has travelled beyond the service area. (matt on video:) right up here is the cross of the uto. No one has seen it for over a hundred years And kelly and I might be the first ones to find it. So, man, we are so stoked. Now, we've got to go back to new orleans tonight To meet up with professor richard, Then we'll be back here... The cross of uto. It's amazing. It's been missing for over a hundred years. I had no idea they were onto its location. Your students really are very good. We also found some notes of matt and kelly's. Have you heard anything about a sect worshipping uto here? No, I didn't even know that the cross was in the country. Legend has it that it's still in haiti. You all right? Yeah, just a little sore. What's the matter? Someone broke into our room. I must've sprained a muscle. Someone broke into your room? We should get going if we want an early start to duvall tomorrow. Sydney, duvall isn't new orleans. They're not very receptive to outsiders there. There can be some very unfriendly elements in voodoo. We'll be careful. Goodbye. (nigel:)so this is duvall. (sydney:)yeah. I guess professor richard was right. They're not exactly rolling out the red carpet. Yeah. I don't see anything that looks like a church. (sydney:)kind of strange. No church in a small town like this. (nigel:)let's see if there's someone in that store we can talk to. (nigel:)I'm getting a very strange feeling. Like we're being watched? Yeah. Yeah. Let's keep going. There's got to be someone here that'll talk to us. You want to know about the cross and the students. How did you know? Look for a fire in the woods tonight, An hour after sundown, south of the motel. Wait. Not here. Tonight, in the woods. (nigel:)sun's going down. Should be getting dark pretty soon. (sydney:)our accommodations for the evening. (nigel:)I don't suppose the building inspectors Get out to the swamp very often. Sydney, about meeting this man tonight, With what the professor said and all, Don't you think it could be a little bit... Dangerous? Mm. Uh huh. Thanks again. All I wanted was a nice teaching job. You've been avoiding me. No, I... Tell me something. What's wrong? I am a... Healthy red-blooded woman, Don't seem to have any problems getting dates. So tell me, what is the problem here? Nothing, it's just... It's against my religion. Oh, please. I've seen you partying at the pub. I have a girlfriend. You and sharon broke up a month ago. I don't even know you. Nothing escapes me on this campus. Do you hear that? Fire drill. Well, you really should... Very well, you leave me no choice. Ow, my hair. What are you, nuts? I will have that man. (nigel:) there we go. Not taking a shower in this room. (claudia on phone:) hello? (nigel:) claudia. (claudia:) nigel, where are you? I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours. I'm sorry, claudia. There doesn't seem to be a lot of reception For cell phones in deliverance-land. Thought you were on bourbon street. (nigel:) no, it's a long story. What's so urgent? I got a package from matt and kelly in new orleans. What's in it? I don't know. I would never open one of sydney's personal packages without her... Claudia. It's a bunch of paperwork. What kind of paperwork? I don't know. There's like 300 pages here. (claudia:) looks like research or something. Overnight it to the hotel in new orleans as soon as you can. Okay. I missed today's pickup But I'll send it out first thing tomorrow. Thank you. (knocking) You might want to put a jacket on before we go out. What do you mean? I can't seem to find my hairbrush. Can I borrow yours? Sure. Nice bird. Thanks. Thank you. (nigel:) do you think there are snakes out here? (sydney:) yeah, but only a couple whose species are poisonous. Oh, that's real reassuring, thank you, yes. Oh, don't worry. They scurry away when they hear people coming. Really? Now, the alligators, they could be a problem. I think I see something. What is it? Not sure. What do you think? Does that look like a fire to you? Maybe. (nigel:) something's not right. It's very quiet. Yeah, I think we're onto something. Did you see that? No. Exactly. (sydney:) fire. Looks like a... Huh. (nigel:) sydney! { Advertisement } (gasping in pain) You all right? Yeah. I guess that flash must have scared them off. I guess. (nigel:) I just can't believe that those creatures Are the same matt and kelly I saw in your class 2 weeks ago. It was them. Or some form of who they were. And now they've turned into some sort of zombie? No, zombies are the living dead. Your friends are still very much alive, But deveraux has them under a strong spell. Who's deveraux? A powerful bokor. A bokor is like a sorcerer. This will help with the pain. The cross of uto gives deveraux his power. What kind of power? The cross can be used for evil by men like deveraux, Gives them great strength and control of others. They are under his spell and will do whatever he wishes. (nigel:)this deveraux must have known That matt and kelly were close to finding it. The cross can also be used to heal the sick And break spells cast by a bokor. And now, it is the only thing that can save your friends. (sydney:) where can we find it? Legend says the cross was stolen from haiti By deveraux's ancestors and brought here. They hid it with a spell that gives him his dark power, Supposedly somewhere in this very bayou. To break the power, we must find the cross. Did I do something wrong? Your hair. It's brown. Yeah, yes, it is. You must change it before the next full moon. Change it to what? Not brown. (nigel:) matt and kelly mentioned they were coming to see you. (nigel:) the symbols look african. (witch doctor:) fulani. (nigel:)it has tribal roots in northern senegal. The symbols on the carvings show where the cross might be. Half of it seems to have broken off. It is only half. When complete, the carving shows the location Of four talismans placed near the cross. They are part of the spell. Only by locating the talismans can we find the cross. So, who has the other half? It was lost long ago in battle. But your friends discovered it in their research. They were bringing it to me, but deveraux got to them first. I'm not sure if he got the carving. I was hoping that maybe you had it. We searched their apartment. There was no wood carving, nothing that looked like this. Then it is hopeless. Maybe not. The package matt and kelly sent to the office. It's still at the office. Let's go back to the motel, call claudia. Syd', it's 2:00 in the morning. I am not happy about this. Yes, I'm sorry, claudia, but it's very important. Now, you're sure there's not a wood carving in the package? I'm positive. It's just paper. But they must've made a copy. It's standard research protocol. Probably made a rubbing of it. Claudia, look for a rubbing. It's like an impression taken of an engraved object. Okay. And it should have african writing on it. Have you been a witch doctor long? I mean, I'm... I'm sure you don't go to school for it Or anything like that, not in a university sense. I mean, can you imagine a bachelor of science From harvard in witch doctoring? Poof. Not brown. No. Wait a minute, I think I found something. Great. Scan it and e-mail it to nigel. It's on its way. It says the cross is buried in a chamber under the ground. It must remain there for deveraux to keep his power. But we have to find the talismans first. Yes. The first is located on an oak tree At the mouth of silver creek. Silver creek is not far from here. (nigel:) the first talisman. (sydney:)pentagram. Let's mark it. Now, all we need to do is find the other 3. (nigel:) okay, we're more or less in the centre of the 4 talismans. (sydney:) I don't see anything that would mark an altar. (nigel:) the carving says the talismans hold the cross' power in place. Well, then the logical place would be the centre. You don't believe that, do you? Well where else would it be? Hold this. Now, the talismans are supposed to show us The location of the cross, right? These are the 4 locations of the talismans we've already found. Each of those talismans has happened to be a pentagram. So if we connect these and finish it as a pentagram, The fifth point is where the cross should be. The top of the pentagram Is the point of strongest magical energy. The other 4 points support it. Now, a pentagram's points are equidistant from the centre. If we measure the distance from here To any one of these torches, The fifth point must be the same distance in that direction. To save your friends, You must place the cross to the front of their heads And chant this prayer: Umbala netay uto. (together:)umbala netay uto. Where are you going? Deveraux will try to stop us. I can perform a ceremony that may counter his power, But I must go back to my hut. Start measuring. From that one? Yeah. (sydney:) 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50. Well, this is the same distance. Probably somewhere around here. Nigel. What if we align it with the direction of the points we found? Stay on my tail, we'll go slow. { Advertisement } (nigel:) pentagrams. The tablet says pentagrams Hold the cross' power in place. Is that it? The spider and the serpent. The leader and his lieutenant, Like in matt and kelly's notes. Strange. Feels like there's an electrical current Running through it. Here. No, no, thanks. Let's just take it upstairs And go find matt and kelly. What? This was way too easy getting in here. Where's this deveraux guy? (creaking) What's that? (creaking) Nigel, the cross. I know about the cross, but what about the words? (nigel:) I can't remember the words. Umbala... Umbala netay uto. Umbala netay uto. Thanks. (deveraux:) now, you didn't think I was just going to let You walk out of here with my cross, did you? Deveraux. Looks like a snake to me. Let me show you how it's done. Don't be discouraged. You did hurt me. In here. Umbala netay uto. Where are we? (sydney:)don't worry, you'll be all right from now on. Let's go. Nigel, why don't you take them back to the motel? If deveraux is the serpent, we have the spider to worry about. I'm going to go visit our witch doctor. Okay. Come on. (sydney:) hello? Hello? Richard. (knocking) Sydney got back early. (nigel:)mr. Richard. Hello. I... I was concerned about you and sydney and... You found them? Matt, kelly, you're okay. (nigel:)they're a little disoriented, But I... I think they'll be all right. Please come in. Thank you. What on earth happened to you two? We're not really sure. Our memories are really weak. (richard:) well, I'm just glad that the two of you are all right. As I recall, once the cross is removed from the chamber, The power it gives you and deveraux is gone. (sydney:) nigel, richard is... The spider. (nigel:)not anymore. His power is gone. (kelly:)I don't think we'll be able to use this for our thesis. A thesis which happens to be 3 weeks late. They convicted him of assault and kidnapping. (sydney:)well, that should put him out of business for a long time. Yes. So tell me about this voodoo ceremony That the priest performed on the cross. It was amazing. Yeah, they put the cross in this shrine in the church. The sun just beamed off it And threw this awesome light show on the wall. (matt:)and then they recited this protection spell Using animal bones and... And potions. And the priest said that any bokors won't be able to touch it After the blessing ritual they did. Well, it's good to know that it's in the right hands. Yes. Oh, and there's one more thing that we want to show you. Oh, my goodness, congratulations. Yes, well, we thought about living together For a little while longer. Right, but then we figured We pretty much had seen each other at our worst. (kelly:) yeah. Nigel, the gangsta look is so over. And besides, you're supposed to wear it like this. Well, it's only 12 hours until the full moon. For the most beautiful woman in the world. (claudia:)for me? You shouldn't have. So I'll see you tonight then. 7:00? Seems like an eternity away from you. I don't understand. What did you do to that poor man? What do you mean? Well, a week ago, He didn't want to come within 3 miles of you. Now, he's practically proposing marriage. How did you do it? I wore him down.

You didn't only silence the children.. ...but your speech, first of all... was very moving and impressive indeed! Nah...nah... Most especially the part about the third path. It made me think deeply. Ya see... I learned them from the ups and downs of my life. So again... 'Pow-thwak-bangbang,' arite? This guy's getting carried away. In all my 20 years of teaching, I've never been this impressed. Young man, we'd like you to work for us! -Eh? Me as a teacher? -Yes! Nah, nah.. your offer is kind but it ain't for me. I know ya guys... work so hard. You have given us so much encouragement, Shirota-san. Nah, nah... Ya see... Though I don't wanna... I had no choice but to do this. Somehow, in this world, I found myself doing what I ain't supposed to do. Is that so? Indeed! You truly are the rising star of child counseling centers! 'Rising star? ' I LIKE THAT~! You're the only one who thinks that. Speakin of 'star'... I like that 'Best Star' truck of Sugawara Bunta.* [*from the 'Truck Yaro' movies of the 70's] That doesn't even have anything to do with this. Come in. Excuse me. What is it, Iwakura-sensei? Actually, I want to consult the child counseling center about a student of mine. -What is it about? I'm the homeroom teacher of 2nd year level Class 1, Iwakura Takako. Iwakura Takako... Did ya... go to Kitanaka High School? Uh... yes. -Is yer nickname, 'Otaka? ' -How do you know my nickname? Do ya remember Sabashima? ...Sabashima Jin! Sabashima... Yes, I remember him... Wow... Long time, no see, eh? -What do you mean, Shirota? -Eh? Oh, uh... this person and Sabashima-san used to be classmates in junior high, amirite? How would he even know that? Ya haven't changed much, eh... Ah, by the way, ya mind if I take yer picture? Oi, Sachiko, c'mon, take our picture. Smile smile, arite? Yep. So you want to consult us on something? Actually, there's a student in my class who hasn't come to school yet this 2nd semester. So is this a case of truancy? I have been encouraging him to come to school but I wasn't quite successful. Please tell us all the details Otaka. Translation and fine timing: earthcolors Raw provider and retiming: furransu Special thanks to: hina_camui ~DON QUIXOTE~ : Episode 8: "The Shout for Love Drive-by" Alex, I bought you some tasty food. Huh? Alex! What are those black lumps? Alex! Are you ok? AALLLEXXXX~! Oh... he just has diarrhea. Leave it alone, and he'll be ok. Excuse me... Is this a quince monitor lizard.... But... he looks so weak... Excuse me, may I see him? Uh, yes. Oh... It's because of the hot weather. You can give relief to his tummy and intestines by giving him supplements, then he'll be better in a week. Are you sure? I'm so glad. Do you... like geckos? Yes, Alex is my best friend. Oh, did I say something funny? No, it's just that it's my first time to have heard that a person's best friend is a gecko. -I know it sounds strange, right? -Oh, no, not at all! Uh I think it's nice. The school principal sounded very happy on the phone. They want you to come again at the closing ceremony of their second semester. Oh, is that so? Well, then I'll talk about the '3 vows' in my next speech. Chief, I've already contacted the parent of Takahashi Keita regarding his truancy. -They'll come here for the interview tomorrow. -Alright. So summer vacation has already ended, but this child hasn't returned to school, huh? So, Chief... I wanna be at the interview meeting tomorrow, too. What's this? Why are you so suddenly eager? You're up to something again, aren't you? Listen ya guys, in this Child Counseling Center, I am known as what do they call me, Nishi-yan? -'The rising star? ' -Damn right, I'm the risin star. So who's better for the job besides me? Only me, amirite? Fine fine... so tomorrow, please do your best, Shirota-kun. -Yep! -Yup. Really? So you got reunited with your childhood friend. Yeah, I didn't expect I'd meet her at that place. That sounds like a nice story. Ah, so this is her... Too bad that it's my face that's there. Not if I can freakin help it. Oh... I see what you mean. This woman was the chairperson of our class. She had a real annoying mouth. She was very frank with me... nagging me about my fighting my studies and hygiene. Well looking back now, I think she was a pretty solid gal. You sound as if you liked her, Sabashima-san? -Do I? Ya think so? -Yes. But ya know... frankly, this person is someone I coulda loved. Ah... 'love.' Not like that, man... I'm talking about the time during junior high. But keep it a secret from Ayumi, okay? Okay. Oh, that's right. Ah... THAT'S RIGHT! Eh? Did you remember something? But he just went a step further, he was a little smarter. You know who I lied to? I lied to Jeff Probst, the host. That's who I lied to. Well, so did Susan. Yeah, well, had to though. Susan, you were a bad liar, too. A terrible liar. Oh, I'm, like awful. I even told these guys, oh, I lie so bad. You looked right at him and went, "No. No." It was bad. It was bad. So, I was glad to have that opportunity. SEAN: Listen, I needed the alliance to stay alive and I knew it was going on, believe me. We have another question up here. Yes, young lady? Um, this question is for the whole group. How do you feel now that you've seen the show on television? Awesome. Love the show. Great. Great show. A lot of what you see out there- - I'm sorry, Jenn. A lot of what you see out there is very manufactured. I mean, while my, you know, lightheartedness and whatever you want to say about my intellect, is a close approximation of the real thing, everyone here, including myself, is a lot deeper character than anything that you saw on television. Does anyone think they were depicted in a fashion that was either unfair or inaccurate? GRETCHEN: Not myself, but I think Greg was. Oh, I would agree with that. He was a lot more boisterous. He's very intelligent and he's not like a goofball... And I got to stick up for Sean. Sean is actually very intelligent. BRYANT: Sean is not goofy? He is not. He's very intelligent. SEAN: Thank you very much. You know, he said the show is manufactured. I don't want people to get the wrong idea, because I think they really did a good job at depicting the sequence and the process pretty accurately. I mean, CBS, Mark Burnett, and Craig Piligian, those people put together a program... You got the million, Rich. You don't need to do this. No, amazing. You got the million. ( applause ) The camera phone... out of this world. Coming up... coming up, we're going to talk about romance on the island-- what did and didn't happen. ( audience whooping ) And Jeff Probst joins us from Australia with the first look at what lies in store for the next Survivor castaways. That's right after this. ( cheers and applause ) But in my years growing up on a Wisconsin dairy farm, I've learned many different survival techniques. For instance, hunting for firewood. ( cocks gun ) Freeze, firewood, now! On the ground! ( cheers and applause ) That was good! That's the first time I've seen that since I made it. My mom was so disappointed with that film. She didn't like it so much it's the only thing she wouldn't copy, out of this whole thing. After that, they put you on the island with us? Yeah, well, I mean, I'm good with a shotgun. BRYANT: Imagine what the people who are applying for the second one are thinking. They've seen yours, they've seen Sean's. I mean, my goodness. B.B.: We're going to have some fruitcakes. Let's go back for another question. Yes, ma'am? Yes, my question is for Colleen and Greg. Was there a budding romance going on between you two while you were on the island, and is there something going on now? ( all oohing ) BRYANT: A two-part question. I've talked about it enough. And, uh, and so, I'm going to pass the... pass the buck. Well, um... Actually, I want it back. Nothing happened. ( laughter ) Nothing happened. I was covering for another relationship going on. ( crowd gasping ) All I'm going to say. That's all I'm going to say. Okay. Pick a number. ( laughing ) Pick a number. How would you characterize the relationship on the island with Colleen? With Colleen, um... Yeah. It was excellent; we had a great time together, and, uh... it wouldn't have been the same at all. We both... played really well together and, uh, inspired each other to have a great time. GUMBEL: Well, who's idea was it to tease the audience and-and leave everyone thinking that maybe something happened? We were there to make a TV show, I mean... we were there. Is that to say it was your idea? Sex and violence. Duh! ( cheering and applause ) They want it. They got it. So it was your idea? I wouldn't say it was either person's idea-- we just had fun. It was all a joke, real... I mean, w-when people ask you questions, you know what they want, so give 'em the answer. I-It's more interesting and exciting. What about the second part of the lady's question? What about since the island? No. Are you going to tell the truth this time? I live in Miami; he lives in Colorado. So what? ( laughing ) They don't have planes in either place is what you're telling us? I... I mean, I'm-I'm 23. Did I miss something? She's-she's... trying to say "No, there isn't, at this point." I mean, you know, young, have fun, see lots of people. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, there are a lot of people who thought strange things. They thought Sean... and Jenna. See, now, we did have sex. ( cheering and applause ) No. Okay, we made an agreement... That's... not to talk about that. That's sarcasm. I do think we should talk a little bit about, um, Joel and Gervase. Yes! You know... It had to come out. Let's bring it out. GUMBEL: Oh, my God, they're out. Well, now, wait a second, though. I did read that Richard... Richard said that on the day before Colleen was complaining about him walking around buck nekkid, Absolutely. that Colleen and Gervase and Greg And Greg. had been sitting around the fire nekkid. GREG: Lying around on top of each other near the fire. True? GREG: Yeah. Sans clothes? Sans clothing? Clothes... Clothing, sans clothing? Yeah. Other languages. I mean, it's raining; you're drying off, but I'm not going to play that game, like, "You were naked, too." You know, I mean, come on. Oh! Oh! RICHARD: ...More naked than she is. GUMBEL: You were naked? COLLEEN: I mean, yeah, I was. ...There you are. All right, not like that, though, not like that. What was the deal there, Richard? Um, nudity is just something I'm comfortable with. I mean, it's, uh... and it's a deserted island, 110 degrees in the middle of the South... South Sea... Deserted? ( all talking over each other ) A few people on the camera crew, and I've got to say, "Hey, Chris." My son. I forgot to say hi to my son. Hey, you. It didn't bother you that it might've offended some folks? Um, when it did offend some people, I immediately put my clothes back on. It was my birthday; I'd intended to spend the entire day nude. So it was your birthday suit. Yeah, absolutely. We intended to kick you off the island. Absolutely. They tried. But I... but I... but my intention isn't to offend. It was just to be comfortable, and, actually, the Tagi team had plenty of time to get used to that, and got... and didn't... Once we combined, it changed a little bit, so I had no trouble putting clothing on Yeah. most of the time. Being from Tagi, I-I would think that you'd be more in the alliance thing, and I think that was everybody's problem-- was that you were alone... and naked, like, naked and alone... where Gervase and I were purely trying to come to the bottom of an age-old myth, and Colleen was judging. ( laughing ) ( cheering and applause ) GREG: We worked together. There were a couple of people naked. Let's-let's get another... let's get another question. Yes, what's your question? Um, so, what was it like eating the bugs: the live worms and stuff? Whoo! Gervase should answer that. Gerv. Stacey. Yeah, Gerv and Stacey. Stacey. Um... everybody just said, "Why not show my poker face?" and that was my poker face. That was your poker face? Oh, yeah. I want to play with you. Yeah. That was the worst thing I've ever done you live here? Even animals clean their places before sitting. Fool, Will you clean quietly or taunt me? Nobody has time these days. Food cooked my mother.

But Mr. Khote, I'm not angry With you. You did the right thing. You only did your duty. But Mr. Khote, you did your duty.. ..and We fulfilled our relationships. If you talk so emotionally, I can never nab any criminal. Let it be. Tell me, how did you get this idea of collecting evidence? Look at this. If people can marry under Water, in air..

Everyone in village say that I too dance very Well. And Bulbul bar is downstairs. If you say.. -Keep quiet. That isn't right. Can We ever forget Khote? God save us from such people! Who is it now? Brother Madan Went to find a house for us. He came so soon. Get the door. -Ok. You? Devaki Nandan Tripathi. Oh! You're celebrating your first night. Ok. I Won't disturb you much. show me the papers of the house. Sir, papers.. You stay here? -Yes. So you must've some paper. Leave and license or ownership? I got news that this flat Was squatted. Got it? show me the papers. Bring the proof. Mithlesh. The distance has become long again. Tom, are you ready? We're gonna miss the opening band. Why? Who's the opening band? I don't know. Some group I've never heard of. I'm cold. Are you cold? No. But then I'm wearing a shirt. Yeah, yeah. I got sweaty; took it off. Yeah, yeah. Are you OK? I'm fine. Got a little something in the back of my throat. OK, so get some water. And dinner tasted weird. And my feet are clammy. You get clammy feet? Only when I'm getting sick. Oh crap. I'm getting sick. Maybe we should just stay home. No, no. You've been looking forward to this concert for like a month. Oh please. There'll be other concerts. Yeah, but not with your fourth favourite band and that other group. Well, Carter and Ava are waiting. And I wouldn't want to disappoint them. OK. Love you. Bye! I forgot my purse. * Can't we find a way that we could be together? * * Is there any way that we could be together? * * And oh by the way, baby, do you love me? * * Yes, I do! Yes, I do! Yes, I do! * Sub made possible by Adriano_CSI Look at this. We got the Hills' mail mixed in with ours again. So just bring it over to Phil. It's bad enough I have to live next to the guy, now I've got to deliver his mail as well? Might as well give him a sponge bath while I'm at it. How do you go from "Hi, here's your mail" to "Hello, want a sponge bath?" To hell with him. I'm keeping his car wash coupon. Ha ha. That can't be right. Hm? No, it is. They have Lyle Lovett stamps now for some reason. No, no, no. It's from MENSA. The intellectual society. Phil's getting mail from MENSA? So? So Phil can't be getting mail from MENSA. I'm a judge and I'm not in MENSA. Phil's just a... whatever the hell Phil is. I guess anything's possible. No it's not. Clearly it's a mix up. Yeah, see, that's what I thought about the Lyle Lovett stamps at first, but then: no. Morning. Morning. You look tired. I didn't sleep. Something keeping you up? More like someone. Tom was up all night coughing and blowing his nose. Tom is sick? A little. I'm sure it's just- Step aside; I'm on it. The orange juice has pulp but I can strain that out. All right. Let's see. I've got Tom's favourite nose drops. We'll just have to find that new digital thermometer. Very accurate. Goes right in his ear. Tom has favourite nose drops? Oh God, I have to call my dentist. I was supposed to have a root canal but obviously that's going to have to wait. Soup! I came as soon as I heard. Sweet. My favourite nose drops. Do you have to do that out here? My porch, my rules. Yeah. I got some of your mail mixed in with ours again. Ah, thanks! I couldn't help but notice you got a letter from MENSA there. Yeah. Trying to rope me into speaking at the next meeting. So you are a member. Six years. Why, aren't you? No. Not as of yet. Really? Yeah. Wow. And you're a judge. Hey, honey. Ben brought us mail. Agh! Damn mailman. Tara's having a bit of a war with the carrier. He started it. Can't you read? Of course I can't read because I'm just a mailman. Don't be obtuse. You know what I'm talking about. Oh, so now I'm illiterate and obtuse. Although I don't know what obtuse means because I'm just a stupid mailman. I'll just go and bone up on this... ow! You did dig your nails into his arm. Could've been a dog bite. He can't prove a thing. I've got it. It's a different kind of MENSA, isn't it? Some sort of a non-profit organization that recycles shoes into rope or rope into shoes or some such thing or... Right? See you, Ben. You should have seen Tom's mom. She was like Wonder Woman. Except instead of the Lasso of Truth, she had a serving tray. Yeah, why does Superman get to shoot lasers out of his eyes and all Wonder Woman gets is a rope? Stay with me, Ava. Right. So you just...you left him alone with his mother? Don't get me wrong; I love Tom to death. I'm just not that good around sick people. Germaphobe? No. I just find them irritating. Aw, that's sweet. You think I'm a horrible person. No, no. I think you lack the nursemaid gene. Nursemaid gene? Yeah. Some people have it; some people don't. It's like curly hair or an extra toe. Oh. Well, Tom's mother has it. Huh. What? You don't like this shirt? Jess, this is a territory issue. You let her take over now and pretty soon she'll be folding your laundry. Well, that doesn't sound so bad. What? Linen wrinkles. Just to be fair, she did have an invisible jet. Huh? Wonder woman. Oh, we're back on that? Ah. There we go. I don't think you can join MENSA on-line. I know that, Wendy. I'm just taking the sample test here to prove that- For fun. For fun; just for fun. Ben, let it go. Just because Phil's in MENSA doesn't make him any smarter than you. Actually... It does. Of course, he's not smarter. It's just that questions are too easy. Here. Look. "If it were two hours later, it would be half as long until midnight as it would be if it were an hour later. What time is it now?" Time for a harder question. Achoo! That's great, Tom! Why don't you just walk around and lick everybody? What are you doing out of bed? Jessie thought maybe we should go for a walk. Yeah, you know. Get some fresh air. Stretch his legs. That is so sweet, Jessie. Seriously, Tom. Don't be an idiot! You'll catch your death out there! Maybe you're right. Listen, you get back upstairs and I'm gonna make you some nice hot tea. Oooh, chamomile? "Apple is to pear as potato is to... Oh God. We had a harder time getting into our country club. Anti-semite bastards. Hey! Hey! Excuse me! Wait a minute! Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah. These aren't mine. They're the Wongs. They live three blocks down the road. You're gonna want to keep that address because that's where all your mail is. What is your problem? I just don't like your type. High society, nose in the air. Always thinking you're better than everybody else. Whoa, whoa. Hey. I am not high society. I happen to be against junk mail because it's environmentally unsound. And for your information, I am very pro-union. Oooh. Mmm. Pro-union. Oh, friend of the working man! Hey everybody! Norma Rae over here! Norma Rae! And you know what? Don't think I didn't see the pages of my Harper's missing! Why would I take them? I can't read, remember? Oh! Jesus! Maybe you can try another tactic. What? Hit him with a shovel? No. Do something nice. Kill him with kindness. Oh. So we're passing on the shovel idea, are we? Can I ask you guys something? When I was a kid and I got sick, did you, like, go nuts over me? No. You never got sick. Really? That doesn't sound right. Yeah, no; it's true. You only ate organic; your immune system was impenetrable. Yeah. Excuse me. I'm sure I remember getting colds. You did, but I took care of you. Your mother's a very loving person, Jess; she's just not very good around sickness. Ah! She was born without the nursemaid gene, right? No. It's just how she's wired. You make it sound like she has an extra toe or something. Ah, Jessie. You're just in time. For what? Oh, your father thinks he's so MENSA. We'll see how MENSA he is. I MENSA'd the hell out of this. "Would you like your results?" No, I want the hockey scores. Of course, I want my results. There we go. That can't be right. What are you looking at? Nothing. What are you looking at? Hm? Hey, baby. I just got back from a nice long walk and I think I have an idea of how we can make you feel better. Shhh. Don't wake him. I just got him off to sleep. These Vitamin C packets will clear you right up. It's concentrated. Mom already gave me like a gallon of orange juice. Which is loaded with sugar. What would you rather have, a cold or diabetes? Are those my only options? Chicken soup is ready. Oh. Mom already made a batch. Did you try it? It's fantastic. This is better than homemade. How so? Because it says so on the box, sweetie. Now. Have some of this and in a couple of hours you'll be on your feet and back to- Well hello, Judith. Jessie. I see you have your tray. Tom said he was hungry. Well, I can take it from here. Oh. It's no trouble. No really, I insist. It's my pleasure. You've done enough. Well, perhaps we should let Tom decide. I'm afraid Tom is delirious due to dangerously high blood sugar. What is that supposed to mean? Guys, guys! It's not a competition. The important thing is that I get better. That's right. * Hey, Ben. Ben! How'd it go? How did what go? The MENSA test. Jessie mentioned you were gonna take it. Oh. It was great. Oh yeah? What was your score? You cheated, didn't you? Huh? You are one big fat cheating cheater and you cheated. Oh. You didn't pass, dude. Now that is seriously bogus. I'm fine. If it makes you feel any better that on-line test isn't a really good barometer anyway. It's not? Nah. The real test is quite a bit harder actually. But forget about the stupid test! Maybe I could pull some strings. I could make some calls. Be great to have a buddy in the club, huh? God, you are one arrogant son of a bitch! I got all your favourites. Maxim, Details, Rolling Stone. Hey, they have an article with the guy on the postage stamp. Check it out, Tomcat. I got you all the SAW movies, plus the first season of Robot Chicken. Oh, thanks baby. That's so thoughtful. Too come! Why? Why must I not go? Forgive me, but allow me this moment of speaking to you unseen. Unseen? Yes, so we may grope for our path of love. I dimly see your lovely self as I stand in the shadows. You are my light, my all. At last, I feel I can let my own heart speak. Lady Moon kindly hid her face. So now I pour out my pent-up emotions to you. I am so happy! A new-born strength is welling up in me. My blood is tingling with ardor. And I offer you my heart and all of me completely. We'II miss you. When do you leave? early in tomorrow morning. I see. Anything wrong in Edo? No, Sire. May I take my leave of the Princess? You are welcome to. Did you tell her of my proposal? She is an orphan... Then I will tell her myself. shall I take you? No, I know where she is. Yes, I tremble, I weep and I Iove you! I'm shaking now. I have to tell you something! I am yours, all yours! I am a captive of your beautiful words! You honor me! Wait, Jurota! Where am I? Who're you? Wait. I am thinking. Aha, this is the Earth, but in what part am I? Komaki! You know me? Who're you? Oh, you're that haughty mustachio who was at Okuni's show. Business? Your business? I'm from the milky Way. milky Way? That's right. RudeIy shattered from my dream of love, I fell down. A bit mad. You do not understand the poetry of words. Go! No, Heihachiro of the Nose is standing guard for lovers. You shall not pass! A strange man. Yes, I must be! But the world's full of us. It's strange for you, a Tokugawa samurai, to be here so late. Absurd! Strange... the land's torn in two! What's that? It's a Iong known fact. There's a front and back; black and white. There's heaven and earth; man and woman. Two make a perfect whole. I know that! Just listen... plain woman, homely man; light and shadow. Drunk? Toyotomi; Tokugawa. What? A head and rear; sword and scabbard. Lord and vassal! Stop it! But some are not perfect. I'm a poet. Some men are the opposite. You look great, bit you're not. Drawing your sword in the Chief CounciIor's home? You're groaning. Someone! Is someone around? An intruder! A strange man! A very strange man! The battle of Sekigahara Victory smiled on the Tokugawa Forces I'm afraid the Tokugawa forces will win... I am not concerned. only for his safety. He wrote from the battlefield, so he is safe. Jurota... Thank of her, and it will lighten your heart. She's no Ionger mine. Absurd! You've sent her letters so she knows you're safe. She's yours now. Stop your nonsense. She loves only you. No. You're young and handsome. It means nothing. Her heart is full with my letters which you wrote. tell me. You loved her, didn't you? No! The truth! fool! Look at me! How could she...! I'm sorry! I should have noticed that. I'm sorry. You...! You're...! Who's there? A deserter! Wait, wait, wait! Let him go. He thinks he's safe, but he'II be caught and killed, anyway. Yes, it's death either way, so let's die bravely. I remember that Sake shop. Heihachiro... do me a favor. What? Did you? You are a smart girl. They told me I'll be ready to take a job in about three months. Lotta. How would you like to go to Chicago to work? Pa would hate it in Chicago. Karie wouldn't like it either. I don't think. I wasn't thinking of them. I mean you. Alone? I'd be lonesome. I'd be scared to be in Chicago alone. I'd be there. I mean. I'd come down often on business trips. We could go to the theater together. Have dinner. You'd like that. Wouldn't you? Yes. But you being a married man and all. People would think it was funny. People wouldn't know. - I guess you don't think much of me if... - Lotta. Darling. I love you. No. You don't. Mr. Glasgow. Don't talk like that. You think just because I'm a young girl... Do you think that I'm old. Lotta? Because I'm not. - I love you. I'll do anything for you. - You mustn't. You must have known how I felt about you the moment I first saw you. No. I thought it was on account of my father. Well. Anyway. I did at first. It was you. Lotta. You're what I've missed all my life. I need you. I've got to have you. I made a mistake once. But now it's going to be different. - Lotta. You and I... - Don't. Mr. Glasgow. You mustn't say these things. It's wrong. You mean because I'm married? I'll get a divorce if you'll only wait. I'll take you away from here. I'll make you happy. I'll do anything that I... I'll see you tomorrow night at the annual party. We'll talk about it then. Well. I'm glad we didn't eat them all up. - Thank you. - They're the best I've ever made. - Glad to see you. - Glad to see you. How are you doing? Captain of the baseball team. - Hello. Barney. - Hello. George. How are you? How do you do? Good to see you. - How are you? - Good evening. How are you? - How are you doing? - How do you do? Hello. Charlie. How are you. Mrs. Schultz? Who are you looking for. Richard? Oh. Just looking. Hello. How are you? How do you do. Mrs. Bolger? Hello. Bert. Glad to see you. Well. Hello. Schwerke. Good evening. Mr. Glasgow. This is my mother and father. - How do you do? - Fine. Thank you. Mr. Glasgow. How are you. Sir? This is Mrs. Glasgow. Mr. And Mrs. Schwerke. - How do you do? - Well. Thank you. Mrs. Glasgow. - I'm glad to see you. - Glad to see you. Mrs. Glasgow. You know Richard. Of course. And this is Tony Schwerke. Yes. I guessed as much. You've got a paper cup and my daughter wants to marry you. I don't want to marry him just because he has a paper cup. Mother. Have you had anything to drink yet? Well. You have something. George. Come here a minute. Come. Schwerke. Have some for yourself. The more I think about that paper cup of yours. The better I like it. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Richard. Oh. Hello. The family's waiting up there. Oh. ja. Now. About free silver... - Hey. Barney. - Hello. Swan! How are you? Hello. Mr. Glasgow. This is wonderful. Where's Lotta? Did you bring her? She just went over there with Richard. By George. Barney. This nice party. Yes. Will you excuse me a minute? Get yourself a drink. Won't you? Hello. Josie. Are you having a good time? Lovely. Well. I'm glad to hear it. Well. Here we are. You were so late coming. I was about to go after you. - I almost didn't come. - Why? - Well. I'm not an employee of the mill. - I know. But Karie and Swan are. Thank you. Richard. Pa and Karie and I are going back to Iron Ridge. - You don't like it here? - We love it. But... But what? It wasn't because of anything I said the other night. Was it? N o a a a a p Yes. Yes. You know. I'm kind of glad it happened. Though. Why? Because it made you so mad that you had to take notice of me. - I noticed you before that. - Did you? And what's all this guff about going back to Iron Ridge? - I've got to go. - But why? - Well. Because... - Because why? Because Pa misses the woods. He's used to an outdoor life... hunting and fishing. Well. You're not going. - You don't belong up there. - I don't know where I belong. Well. I'll tell you. You belong with me. I'm going to New York to live. And you're coming with me. We'll crash New York together. Just a couple of rubes from the Middle West. Mr. And Mrs. Richard Glasgow have taken an apartment at the Waldorf. - Can I help you. Mr. Glasgow? - No. Thank you. - Come out of there. - Now wait a minute. Father. Come on and fight. Because I'm going to lick the everlasting daylights out of you! Father. You crazy? You out of your mind? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! I'm in love with Lotta and she's in love with me. We're going to be married. And there's nothing you can do about it. Don't. Richard. Don't! He's your father. He's an old man. Get out of here. Both of you. Come on. Lotta. Bernard! Bernard! There you are. I've been looking... What's the matter? What is it? What's the matter? - That precious son of yours. - What... - I threw him out of the house. - Why? He's going to marry that girl. Is that all? Is that all? You don't care? No. As long as it isn't you. I thought it was you. Maybe. But then. Perhaps even you can't have everything you want. There. You look better now. The tables are all ready. But they won't sit down. See if you can get them to come in and eat. Barney! Barney. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Nothing's the matter. Swan. I'm an old man. Swan. An old fool. Come and get it! Come and get it! Come and get it. Or we'll throw it to the dogs! Come and get it! Come and get it. Or we'll throw it to the dogs! Come and get it! His Excellency the prime minister, Count Taaffe. I've been waiting five minutes. Forgive me, Your Majesty, but I was detained. Fine. Proceed. The wedding preparations are all in order: procession, carriages, accolades, police. Next matter. I must draw Your Majesty's attention to the intolerable student demonstrations. Still? With greater frequency and violence by the day. I'd point out in particular the campaign that Mr. Szeps continues to wage in his notorious liberal rag. He knows exactly how far he can go and stops there. I cannot touch him unless I bend the law slightly. He'd be less brazen without his friends in high places. Meaning what? You know I like things stated clearly. It's just my impression, but I believe that Szeps is a rather too frequent visitor to the prince's apartments. - Albert. - Your Majesty? These croissants don't taste the same. Did we change bakers? I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but our baker is ill. When he's ill, breakfast is inedible. My illnesses entail less consequence. Where were we? Szeps and his frequent visits. We were, in fact, discussing the students. What do you intend to do? Do I have permission to use force? It's strength that commands respect, my dear Taaffe. Your passports, quickly. Nationality? - Czech. - Croat. We recognize neither Czechs nor Croats, only faithful subjects of His Majesty. Subjects, yes. Faithful is another matter. - lf you believe what passports say - - Take them away! Send in the next ten to see the inspector. Silence! Take off your hats! - Your name and papers. - Here they are, sir. I was just attending classes and knew nothing about it. My father - Fine, fine. Let him go. Next. Szeps, managing editor of the new paper in Vienna? How did you get mixed up in this brawl? I was merely passing by. You will kindly remain at the disposal of the police. Have him sign the form. Next. Papers? - l have none. No papers. Name? Rudolf. This is no place for jokes. Rudolf who? - Of Hapsburg. - What? Rudolf of Habsburg? The archduke? But Your Excellency... The heir to the Austrian throne rounded up with this Szeps by the police. You mix with scoundrels and side with the rabble. You have friends who would bring down the monarchy, even destroy the empire. You, the emperor's son. - Spare me the lecture, Father. I'm learning to rule my people by listening to them. Let others listen for you. You have secretaries, ministers, police. You should be devoting yourself to your soon-to-be bride rather than this Szeps. Please don't expect me to play the lover. This marriage was your idea. To ensure the crown and your happiness. The two are unfortunately irreconcilable. I've seen that in my mother's eyes since I was a child. Does she complain? No more than I. I've agreed to marry Stephanie, but don't expect a show of joy. Rudolf, is there a woman in your life? A woman? There are ten. A hundred. All the ones I want, and even those I don't. But let us say no more. I will marry the princess and produce an heir. The interests of the state will be served. Ask no more of me than that. A magnificent spectacle. No one escapes his destiny, my son. God grant that you learn that with time. God grant that I never meet the great love of my life. I'm soaked to the skin. The more it rains out here, the more they live it up inside. What a rotten job! At least we have the honor of being attached to His Highness in person. Look, a new arrival. That's Count Hoyos getting out. - They're drinking companions. Like you and me. Who's the other one? Colonel of the 4th Hussars, Baron Cravet. Hold on. I'll write that down. Start a new page. It's after midnight. You're right. It's May 10th now. Hey, isn't that funny? - What? - May 10th. - What about it? He was married five years ago. You're right. Exactly five years ago. Well, if I dared go out on our anniversary, Mimi would give me hell. - We'll be here till dawn. - Or until they're done. Let us drink So tomorrow we'II be brave Let us sing And our fatherland we'II save Let us march On to victory's brink But first fall in love It makes you bolder than you think And so my friends, Iet's drink Tired, Your Highness? Bored, Josef. Bored to death. Won't you drink with us, Your Highness? This is your wedding anniversary. Thank you, Josef! Gentlemen, it seems that today is my wedding anniversary. You ask for a toast? Here it is: to the health of the happy couple. Well? Won't you drink to my happiness? To Their Highnesses' health. Marinka, won't you sing in honor of the occasion? Your Highness has only to ask. Philipp. is Szeps here? - Not yet, Your Highness. He is, as always, with Hoyos, Prince Philipp, and the rest. - And Marinka? - Marinka too, of course. My agents report to me every 15 minutes. - Still no Szeps? - No. Are you sure he'll go to Sacher's? Absolutely. He still needs the documents for his article tomorrow. - Our agents never leave his side. - So he hasn't seen the archduke yet. If I could just prove they're working together. I must have those papers at any cost! Rest assured, Your Excellency. They may be crafty, but I know my job. Why do I love you? Is it your beautiful eyes, your hair The tender sound of your voice Oh, why? Yes, why? For dinner? For your money? Your cruel ways? The prestige of your name? No, not at all Why do I Iove you? Ask not the reason for my love As long as I know And I Iike you, that's enough Why do I Iove you? There's no reason I should say But in my arms your cares will fade away You're dreaming, my dear - of me, I trust. You'll forsake me soon, like all the rest. Who can know these things? Trust to destiny as I trust you. - She's jealous, Your Highness. - Gypsy blood. She denies it, but she's madly in love with Your Highness. Madly in love... - Well? - He isn't here yet. I must know the moment he arrives, or you'll pay. - Will you wait here? - However long it takes. I want to arrest Szeps myself. - l understand. Congratulations, Marinka. You sing even more sweetly for the police. You play the paramour, but you're really a parasite. Bill yourself as ""the gypsy policewoman," with your new orchestra leader here. - Who sent you? - Your Highness - What ""highness"! You treat me like your prey, like a thief, a common criminal. Who sent you? Tell me! Tell me, or I'll wring it out of you! Your Majesty, please - Afraid of the prime minister, are you? Taaffe sent you, didn't he? Your Majesty... Too cowardly even to confess. You disgust me. Here, Marinka. I'd hate you to lose the money you sold me for. After last night, my patience is at an end. - Forget all that. - No, I've had enough. Sometimes I just want to disappear. I'm constantly watched. Without even looking, I can tell you that two detectives are following us now. They're finally sitting down. We can rest a bit. What's the fun in walking when he has all those carriages? These places are the only diversion left for me. What about women? They disgust and bore me. They pursue me out of vanity or self-interest. It's too easy. Their own husbands push them into my bed. Let's do an experiment. What if I went after your daughter? - My daughter? - Why not? She's pretty and young. Far too young. Besides, she's not your type. She has glasses and thick ankles. Don't worry. I was only kidding. Szeps, look at that girl. She's gorgeous. Wait for me here. All alone, poor darling? Don't be frightened, my pet. I'm really very nice. How dare you pester this young lady. I thought she was alone - - She's with me. ls that enough? - Yes, certainly. I just thought - Excuse me. Please forgive me. How could you? You don't even know me. You told a lie. Isn't a little lie better than a grave impertinence? - Yes, he was awful. - See? - Thank you. - No, you mustn't. You are very young to be wandering alone in this crowd. I wasn't alone, but I lost my mother, sister and cousin in the crowd so - - So we'll look for them. - You and me? If you like. It's odd, but I have the feeling I know you. Against the wishes of my father, the king, I have come to you, prince of my heart. Oh, my angel! Oh, my treasure! I'll don my silver armor. To do what, my lion? To tell the king of our love. - God save you. - God save our love. Oh, Lord! Who is this terrible man? I am the devil, and I have come for you. Why? To roast and toast you, broil and boil you. Mr. Devil, please do not take me. Such happiness was to be mine. - All the better! Happy souls are all the nicer to torment! Have mercy, Mr. Devil! No, no pity! How sad. She loved and she was punished for it. - lt doesn't seem fair to me. - No, not very. Who is it that you remind me of? Look, they're so pretty. - That one looks like you. - l only wish. I'll try to ring it. Give me some rings. Three rings for 20 sous. - You'll never do it. - Just wait. You missed. Missed again. He did it! Amazing. Sir, you won this taffy. Thank you. What luck. Wait. We'll divide it equally. Here - for you. - Thank you. I love it. My mother! She mustn't see me with a stranger. - Don't go. She didn't see you. - No, I mustn't stay. Good-bye. I realized, once you weren't looking at me, that it's Archduke Rudolf that you remind me of. - Does that bother you? - Not at all. Good-bye. Since when is Your Majesty fond of taffy? Taffy? It must have been another late night, Your Highness. It's not my fault, Loschek. I must have some relief from the boredom of my days. I understand, Your Highness. Life is no carnival. Your voice sounds very strange. Bad news? Mr. Szeps was here earlier, before dawn. Why didn't you show him in? I didn't want to wake you, and he was very rushed. They closed down his paper. There's a warrant out for his arrest. - Szeps arrested? No, he managed to escape. He's safe. He said to assure Your Highness there's no need to worry. How dare they? This time they've gone too far. Come in. What is it? His Excellency the prime minister, Count Taaffe. - His Highness is not ready - - Show him in. You hear me? Show Count Taaffe in. His Highness is in the bathroom. My respects, Your Highness. To what do I owe this honor? I've come this early only because I wished to inform you personally of the measures ordered by His Majesty to deal with Szeps and his paper. I know. Your Highness is well-informed. That's unfortunate for me, since I'd hoped to demonstrate my sincerity and devotion. Never use words beyond your comprehension. Your Highness is unfair. I came in hopes of reaching an understanding. Our common goal is the national interest. Do you spy on me in the national interest? I simply wish to ensure that Your Highness is protected. Against what or whom? I need protection only against you. Listen carefully: I insist that the measures taken against Szeps be rescinded immediately. That is beyond my power. Only His Majesty - This is not His Majesty's doing, but yours. Let me explain - - Will you rescind those orders? - l cannot. Loschek, my jacket. Yes or no? You know that that's impossible. We'll see about that. The prince seems on edge. Lack of sleep, no doubt. His Highness gets plenty of sleep. Loschek, you know him better than I. Do you think I should wait for him? I think not, Your Excellency. Tell His Majesty I must speak to him at once. - The archduke seems upset today. - He's high-strung, like his mother. How can someone so high-strung be a dreamer too? Well? I'm in a hurry. His Majesty is too busy at present, Your Highness. What's that? It will be 48 hours before he can grant an audience. No audience for 48 hours? I can't see my own father? No audience for 48 hours... for me, his son. Your Highness, please. Loschek, this can't go on. These people are killing me. But what does it really matter, with my life what it is? I can't go where l choose, see whom I will. Locked up in a uniform at the age of eight. My friend is arrested. I ask my father for help, and he replies through his aide-de-camp. Etiquette, intrigue, deceit! Enough! Your Highness, my poor prince, don't torment yourself so. There's no one in the world I can turn to, someone without ambition or treachery who'd look beyond my position and accept me for myself, a simple human being. That's what I need. Tell me: Am I not a man like any other? Don't I too have the right to a little happiness? I must be mad. You can do nothing for me, my poor old friend. No one can, not even myself. Now what? His Majesty requests your presence at a gala at the Opera tonight. The entire court will attend. His Majesty insists upon your presence in the royal box. A gala? The entire court? They found the answer, Loschek. A gala at the Opera! Princess Stephanie is with the emperor, as usual. While the archduke - Who's that smile for, Edwige? The archduke's cousin, Countess Larisch. They call her ""the Rattlesnake." She's lethal. Edwige shouldn't smile. Her teeth are as false as her pearls. What a crowd! Look, someone new in the third box to the left. In white? That's Baroness Vetsera's daughter. The whole family's there. The young lieutenant is her brother. I must take the child under my wing. If she's not spoken for, I'll see to her future. You can sit down now, Maria. Georges, the officer sitting beside the emperor - That's Archduke Rudolf, of course. Hello, everyone. No, don't get up. I just popped in for a second before the curtain. - The countess is so kind. - A charming dress, as always. Hello, Georges, Hanna. And your little cousin. And Maria, a real lady! I know that a secluded life is a happy one, but this child is much too adorable for you to hide away. She must come to my next reception. Wouldn't you like that, Maria? - Well, Maria? - What are you dreaming of? The curtain's going up. I must fly. - Have you kept me in mind, Countess? - You? Why should I? Oh yes, of course. I never forget a thing. Good-bye for now. - Did you enjoy it? - Yes, very much. She's wonderful. What's her name? - Who? - The ballerina. Ah, the - l don't know. Georges, come with me to pay your respects to Princess Emilie. Wait for me here. Look! It's the Schratt woman with the emperor. - Where? - ln the middle of the box. Who's she? You've heard of La Pompadour? The emperor's like Louis XV. Did you see the archduke bow to Madame Bischoff? I hear he's left her for a Frenchwoman, Madame de Langeais. It seems he's keeping both. - They say he has a gypsy too. - Every man I know has a gypsy. If the Turkish solution didn't involve the Balkan question, and St. Petersburg - The girl in white in the sixth box - striking, isn't she? Probably a debutante. I've never met her. I believe she's Baroness Vetsera's youngest daughter. I've heard a thing or two about her - Maria Vetsera. Vetsera, you say? I'd be glad to know Your Highness's opinion. Certainly. Your Majesty. I saw your performance two days ago. You were more adorable than ever. Good evening, Count. Having a good time? Good evening, my dear cousin. Your Excellency. Busy with affairs of state? No, that requires a vast knowledge of men, and in Vienna you alone can lay claim to that. Except that like you, I enjoy solitude, Your Highness. There you are, cousin. You're as rarely seen these days as a smile on your father's face. I haven't seen you for ages, and I suspect you aren't even listening to me now. I was going to do you a favor. That's right. An opportunity to demonstrate your generosity. Ask what you will, cousin, but - Oh, never mind. I know what those ""buts" mean. I'd intended to mention the Vetsera boy, but I'll be going. - Did you say Vetsera? - l did indeed. He dreams of serving in your regiment. Wasn't a Vetsera our ambassador in Constantinople? Indeed. Your Highness has a remarkable memory. This Vetsera has a son? And a daughter too. You are incorrigible. So when may he introduce himself? My darlings, what a crowd! I thought I'd never get back before the curtain. Then she got up on her toes, Nanny, and whirled around and around, faster and faster. But he didn't even see her. He was looking at our box the whole time. Nanny, listen! - l am listening, my love. It was so lovely. The lights, the music, the jewels - all for him. - For whom? Didn't you understand a word I said? For the prince. The one I met at the Prater, where he ringed the swan. You know, I think he recognized me. The theater got you much too excited. Go to sleep now. Sleep? I'll never be able to sleep again. He's so handsome, Nanny, with such sad eyes and such a gentle smile. Just thinking of him will take up every hour of the day. Please listen to me. Don't be afraid. Don't move. is it really you? This is wrong, I know, but I had to speak to you, and it was the only way. Please, Your Highness. Maria... I tried to resist, but I couldn't. You've haunted me night and day. Your Highness... I see you so rarely, but even that fills me with joy, such emotion, but also such anguish. Just one moment. I must see you again. Don't say no. Don't make me suffer. But how? I'm never alone. - l must see you. - Really, Your Highness? For you I have no title. Promise me. - But it's impossible. - Everything's possible if you really want it. Here's Nanny. Good-bye. - Where have you been? - Here, waiting for you. Nanny, do you think a prince can be unhappy? Just like anyone else, Maria. Maria, you realize you've been playing the same piece for two days now? It's so pretty, Mother. - Is the baroness in? - Yes, Countess. Hello, my dear friend. Hello, my child. No, do go on. I love that song. How can we ever thank you? My son is ecstatic, and it's such an honor for the family. - Don't mention it. - Please have a seat. No, I like to keep moving. It's good for the nerves and the figure. May I? Speaking of which, have you seen how much weight Marquise Perutti has put on? It's as natural as breathing to her. You'd think she never ate at home. These are delicious. At the gala she looked like a fat old ewe on her hind legs. But no one noticed. They only had eyes for your daughter. Maria was a tremendous success. Everyone asked me about her. She was the sensation of the evening. You'll make her vain. Maria isn't vain... are you? Play louder and listen carefully. Princess Koralyi - there's a vain woman, though she looks like a monkey who scrambled down her family tree. My cousin wants to see you. Don't tremble. She went on and on about her ancestors. Keep calm, for heaven's sake. Don't stop playing. When she sighed the other night, she killed a butterfly. Rudolf spoke of you for an hour. You've quite bewitched him. Play louder! Oh, you're invited to old Princess Ursula's next Saturday. How kind! We'd be honored. Not so loud, Maria. It's not a military march. Your compliments must have turned her head. Few women would be unmoved. Do you like my dress? I've discovered a little dressmaker. The craftsmanship of Berlin and the elegance of Paris. 6:00 already! I have a fitting. You wouldn't refuse me a little favor, will you? Promise me. - Anything you wish, Countess. I want to borrow Maria for an hour. Two heads are better than one at fittings. Besides, I get so bored alone. You wouldn't mind? - Not at all. Get ready quickly, Maria. Yes, Countess. Such a lovely child, your Maria. Good-bye. See you soon. Have no fear, my dear. Bratfisch, the cabman, is devoted to Rudolf, and no one at the palace will see you. It's as discreet as can be. Look at me, child. You're not wearing any powder - or not enough, anyway. That's better. Your eyes are perfect. Just lower them now and then to dazzle him all the more later. Hair back a little. Very nice. Forgive me, but at your age one only knows one's faults and not one's charms. Thank you. What a face! Aren't you happy? Oh, I really am. I just can't believe I'm going, that he really wants to see me. I'm not in for anyone. I want to be undisturbed for an hour. - Someone new, Your Highness? - You guessed it, Loschek. An actress? A married woman? - A young maiden. - A real one? So they say. ln these times, I wouldn't fret for her virtue. I saw her once, I spun the usual yarn, and she'll be here in a few minutes. - That's Bratfisch's cab. - Delivering the prince's prey. Who was that with Countess Larisch? - No idea. She's new. - We'll need her name. I'll be back for you in an hour. kindly follow me, miss. This way, miss. My little Maria, at last. Oh dear, am I so late? But right up to the last moment, I thought you might not come. That you'd be afraid. - Of what? I don't know. This palace... this gloomy room... me. You? On the contrary. When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything. How awful! You keep that around all the time? Why? To make life bearable. Bearable? But life is so wonderful. You're right. I'm talking nonsense. Won't you take off your hat? Yes, but how can I? There's no mirror. There's one in the next room. That's where you sleep? I imagined a prince's bed - lt suffices. I sleep so little. The mirror is to the left. My hair's a mess. You're not going to like me. I like you too much. I'm so happy. What is it? What's the matter? Come along. Don't stay in here. Ever since I met you, nothing makes sense. You come here and speak to me like no one ever has before. Don't you have some request? What do you mean? People usually want something: position, advancement, honors, money. What about you? Think about it. is there really nothing you want? - Don't I have all I want now? All right, Loschek. Don't be afraid. It's just a signal. We must part. Promise you'll come back. You don't know what you mean to me, how good you are for me. You make me feel years younger - and what years I've lived! Go now. Quickly. - So they last met on Friday? - Yes, between 6.:00 and 7.:00 p.m. - At the palace? - As usual, Your Excellency. This is serious - far too serious - and just as His Majesty thought. With a girl of good family, it could mean scandal. His Majesty made it clear this affair must be terminated... discreetly. Leave it to me, Your Excellency. - But how? I have some experience in these matters. To Baroness Vetsera, SaIezianer Gasse 1 4. ""Dear Baroness... A weII-meaning friend... concerned for the honor of your family... feels that it his duty to warn you... that your esteemed daughter Maria... has, for several weeks now..." Good evening, my love. Did I scare you? Admit it: You didn't hear me coming. - How fresh you look. - My hair's soaking wet. I had to find some excuse for not going out with Mother tonight. She thought not going to the theater would be a punishment, so we have two whole hours together. We've never had such wealth before. What's wrong? - Look over there. It's just branches moving. You see spies everywhere. They lost you tonight. - They're just better hidden, that's all. Forget them. I love you. They'll never leave me alone. You don't know them. They want to separate us. - But can they, my darling? - What faith you have, what strength. I love you. And we have two hours. Two hours! These fleeting rendezvous, this constant separation. For once I'm proud of my love. Why should I hide it? Two hours... when I long to spend my whole life with you. - Mother! - Where have you been? I just wanted - l demand to know where you've been. For shame! Now I see why you pretended not to be ready this evening. I see now that what this awful letter says is true. Don't lie to me! I have no intention of lying. You mean this dreadful thing is true? You have a lover? Who is it? Mother dear, don't talk like that. You're mistaken. I swear we've done nothing wrong. He loves and respects me. - What is his name? I can't tell you. I am your mother. I absolutely must know. I beg of you. - No, I won't tell you. Careful, Maria. I can force you. Threats are of no use. Very well. You'll leave tomorrow for your uncle's in Trieste for six weeks. That should cure you of your folly. Mother! Do with me what you will, but please let me stay in Vienna! It's you? What's wrong? is Maria ill? Say something! Let me catch my breath. She's gone. An anonymous letter. The girl was brave and wouldn't talk. Her mother was furious and packed her off to her uncle's near Trieste. - Trieste? - That's right. Don't look so glum. After all, what's a month? A month? A month without her? You don't realize what this means. My life will be like before. Alone once again, up against all those people. They know their business, all right. He entered Sacher's at 1 2.:10 a.m. and staggered out around 3.:00 a.m. He arrived at the AIcazar at 3.:15. exactly the same routine as every day for the past six weeks. It's despair over the little lady's departure, so I hear. - ls he alone? - What does Your Excellency mean? No women with him? Oh yes, a different one every night. Sometimes several. He wouldn't even notice if it were the same one every night. His Highness hasn't been sober in six weeks. Leave me alone! Faster, for God's sake! Here, I'll cool you off! - He hasn't been like this in a long time. - He's out of practice. - There's not enough rum! - Another bottle! Put out the lights! Here, drink! Let's drink our fill and savor love's thrill Tomorrow in battle we'II be victorious Some hearts will break but triumph we'II taste The enemy is hateful Women are glorious Let us drink So tomorrow we'II be brave Let us sing And our fatherland we'II save Let us march On to victory's brink But first fall in love It makes you bolder than you think And so my friends, Iet's drink - Whose face is that? - Where? There. It's you, sweetheart. Out of my sight! You hear me? Out of my sight! Still there, are you? Just wait a minute. Take that. And that! Your Highness. What do you want? A lady downstairs is asking for Your Highness. - Pretty? - Very, Your Highness. Excellent. I'll go get her and bring her back by force, if necessary. You here? I got back today and just had to see you. I sneaked out and managed to find Bratfisch. Kiss me. - You're mad. No one must see you. - Rudolf. - Let me go. I stink of wine. You're bleeding. Are you hurt? - Where? - There. It's lipstick from Irma, a whore. Yes, I kissed a whore! I'm still free, aren't I? Of course, darling. What are you doing here? Can't you leave me alone when I'm having fun? Are you spying on me too? is Taaffe paying you? What do you want from me? Just to see you. Well, have a good look. A pretty sight, aren't I? Happy now? Never seen a man drunk before? I just want to be left alone. I'll drink all I please and sleep with every woman in Vienna. You can't stop me! Don't look at me like that. Why don't you say something? I don't deserve a reply, is that it? I disgust you too much? Say something, for God's sake! Speak or I won't be responsible for what I do! My poor darling, how you're suffering. Maria, I'm so ashamed. Why, my darling? I love you so much. How can you still? Forgive me. You don't know how I suffer. I know. No, you can't know. Maria, my dear child. Save me. I'm afraid I'll go mad. I'm afraid without you. What will I do tonight after you leave? I'm not going to leave you. Am I not yours, my love? - Good evening, Mr. Bratfisch. - Good evening. Tell me... He's here. Ah, thanks. lf anyone wants me, I'll be over there. Very well, Mr. Bratfisch. Life is starting, Maria. Soon we'll no longer need to hide. I'll be free and we'll be together always. Always? But l've written to Rome. - What about your father? He doesn't know yet, but he'll have to accept the annulment. You did that for me? Listen, Rudolf... whatever happens, I'll never be unhappy again. What's that? A wedding ring? It's so beautiful. There's a date on it. - November 13th. That night at Sacher's. There are letters: ""R-D-L-A-J-L-M" ""United in love unto death." How lovely. Thank you. You must put it on my finger yourself. - Why? Because then I can make a wish. What did you wish for? To die before you. - You know who's here? - Who? The archduke. Right over there. - The archduke, here? - l swear - and with a woman! - Did you recognize her? - l couldn't quite see. - Can't you guess? - Who else but the Vetsera girl? - What's that? - Oh, you're here? I forbid you to trifle with my sister's name. Who are you to forbid me anything, boy? - l'll show you. - l doubt that. My brother! Calm down, Vetsera. This is a public establishment. Apologize. - You're unworthy of being an officer. - You're no judge. - How brave, insulting a girl! - And you're a brave talker! Take her home, then come back for me. - What's going on? - Officers coming to blows. It's a disgrace! You may change your tune when my seconds call! - Brave men don't brag! - l'll slay you like a dog! Lieutenant Vetsera, I think you've had too much to drink. Come here. - Your Highness. I don't need anyone to defend my name, and I will tolerate no interference from my officers in a matter that concerns only myself. You are confined to barracks for ten days. Report to your colonel. You are dismissed. And you, Captain Schonberg, will report to regiment headquarters tomorrow. I'm afraid my regiment is too coarse for a man of your sensitivity. Well, gentlemen? Don't let a pair of idiots stop the party. Give me a glass. He's so handsome when he's angry. To the regiment. To Your Highness! Aren't you going to dance? Maestro, give us a nice waltz! May I have the pleasure of this waltz? - Your Highness! I will never forget this. I'll speak of this all my life, Your Highness. Rudolf, you must save Georges. I know him. He won't relent. He'll want the truth. He'll insist on a duel. He'll be wounded, perhaps even killed. Calm down, Maria. I'll speak to him, I promise. Yes? Your Highness is awaited in the audience room. Duty calls. I'll be just 15 minutes. Wait for me here. I'd suggest you keep your coat on, miss. If you caught cold in this drafty palace, His Highness would never forgive me. You're very kind, Loschek. Kind? Me? You don't know much. Loschek, where are you? I looked everywhere. Forgive me. I had to conduct His Highness to an audience. - Will he be long? - l fear so, Your Majesty. Tell him I came to inquire about his health. He will be touched. In fact, I'll just leave a note on his desk. Sorry to disturb you, miss. You should have told me. Leave us. I came to see how my son is doing. is he well? He seemed a bit tired, madam... Your Majesty. Poor Rudolf. He's not suited to this life. You and I have never met, but I know he loves you. Please sit down. You're even lovelier than I'd heard, and so young. How old are you? - Seventeen, madam. Seventeen? At 1 7 I was already unhappy. But I was young... and I didn't suffer too terribly. One really should die young. I'm sorry. Living in solitude sets one to musing out loud. This palace is an unhappy place. Do not return. Let me kiss you, my child. You are very dear to my heart. Your Highness! I must talk to you, Vetsera. I mean to prevent this duel. - lmpossible, sir. He slandered my sister, and such lies - Vetsera, suppose Schonberg was telling the truth? What? You? I don't understand, Your Highness. It can't be. Sit down, Georges. And now, as an older comrade, I beg you to try to listen calmly. Will you promise me that? - Yes, Your Highness. No one in the world loves Maria more than I do. No, not even you. Before she came along - You couldn't understand all I'd have to say. She set me free with her gaiety, her youth, her love. Was I to refuse all that? Think about it. Nothing in this world is really mine, not even myself. Like everyone, you think I have everything I could desire. Or perhaps you think that being the emperor's son means I have no right to the woman I love. Be fair: What was I to do? Georges, Maria is my love, and soon all will know. As soon as I'm free, I'll marry her. She knows that. If you want my oath - l believe you, sire. You've lost your head. You flaunt yourself in public, let our name be bandied about by drunken officers, all for a little thing - - Who will soon be my wife. - l know. You even asked the pope to annul your marriage. Here's the Holy Father's reply. - You spy on my personal matters too? - This concerns me as well. If you've forgotten, the Holy Father hasn't. What's the answer? Negative, naturally. You're having an affair - - Am I the only one? No, and when you're emperor, you may do as you please. Meanwhile, you will end this. - lmpossible. - lf l order you? - l won't obey. - You'd dare? - l'll abdicate. I care nothing for power, and I won't sacrifice Maria to it. You have no right to speak this way. You have obligations. The people of two nations have placed their hope in you. Consider your honor. I love her. If you really love her, you'll give her up. What are you going to do? There are convents from which women never leave. - You would dare? - This liaison must end! I beg you, Father. It's my life you're asking of me. - A passing fancy. It's life or death to us. Leave her or she goes to a convent. There's no other solution. Yes, there is. What do you mean? - lt wouldn't interest you. - Will you obey? If I may see her once more. You will, at the ball tonight. I want to see her alone. Very well. I'll give you 24 hours, and that will be the end of it. Do I have your word? Yes. Mother, do I look too awful tonight? For the tenth time, no! You're just silly. Don't listen to her. She was the same way at her first ball two years ago. - Any news of the lovebirds? - What lovebirds? Oh, I have absolutely no idea. - The Vetsera girl at a court ball! - The archduke has gone too far! They can meet in private, after all. - Do you think she's so attractive? - Everyone has their charm at 1 7. Here comes the court. - Where's the empress? - She doesn't come to galas anymore. What is it, Maria? The archduke's a bit glum tonight. We're not amused, having just been forced to give up the girl. Will Your Highness open the ball? It has to be me? If such be Your Highness's pleasure. My pleasure? Very well. - lt's going to start. - Look! He's coming this way. Will you do me the honor of opening the ball with me? -Your Majesty. - Keep calm. Don't forget that you're the archduchess of Austria. Good evening, Your Highness... my love. How is it that you look so beautiful tonight? I'm wonderfully happy, that's all. Wait here. May I have the honor of this waltz, Your Highness? How did I ever live before I met you? I knew nothing, felt nothing. I didn't exist. Thank you, Rudolf. - Don't, please. - What's wrong? Listen, Maria. Suppose l were suddenly forced to go away? I'd wait for you. No, very far away, for a very long time. I'd follow you. Suppose that were impossible? Why? I'd follow you anywhere. Even... to the land of no return? With you, yes. How he looks at her! It's indecent, dancing so close! - Such impertinence! - Unheard of in our day! Those three witches are talking about us. It isn't pleasant growing old. Allow me to introduce you to my father. I want him to see you tonight. He's presenting her to the emperor! May I present Baroness Maria Vetsera, whose fate Your Majesty has sealed. Your youth and beauty promise fulfillment of all your hopes, young lady. Your Majesty is too gracious. You have the stronger hand. They'll never meet again. Bratfisch will be waiting in the usual spot. He knows where to take you. Yes, Your Highness. Maria, my dear, what an honor! You may be proud of yourself. The emperor spoke to you. What did he say? I don't know. What do you mean? You don't realize how lucky you are. - Hoyos. - Your Highness. Have Bratfisch come to the cloakroom, then come back here. I need you. I request Your Majesty's permission to retire. - There's going to be a scandal. - A scandal? Well, I had nothing to do with it! Curtsy nicely. What's gotten into you? Luckily she overlooked it. I need an excuse to leave Vienna for 24 hours. Arrange a hunting party, but I want only you and Philipp. Your Majesty can count on me. Till tomorrow. At Mayerling? At Mayerling. Going off in the middle of the night. I should never have helped you. Don't worry, Nanny, and don't scold, especially tonight. You don't know it, but it's the most wonderful day of my life. Believe me. Here we are. Good evening, Bratfisch. Evening, miss. Good-bye, Nanny. Wait. I have something else to ask of you. Give this letter to Mother... but not until the day after tomorrow. You're frightening me, my child. You won't do anything bad, will you? Bad? Oh no, quite the opposite. You swear? Everything I do will be right and proper. I swear. Good-bye, Nanny. Maria! Here I come. Be sure you find a good hiding spot. - You call that a good hiding spot? - You started before I was ready. - l didn't know. - You always cheat. lt's not fair. I'd have found you anyway. I know every corner of Mayerling. Mayerling... lt sounds like a name in a fairy tale. Cold, darling? I want to ask you a favor. What is it? You decide when it's time for us... for us to go. You know, it's simple. It takes only a moment. - l don't need reassurance. All I want is not to know when. Promise? You'll know nothing. Set your mind at ease. Leave it to me. You must do something at once. My daughter disappeared last night, and we've heard nothing since. If you wish, I'll have the police make thorough inquiries. We already went to the police. They've been no help. I come to you, Your Excellency, because I've learned things I was unaware of yesterday. I think His Highness the archduke may know where she is. I'm certain he knows! You must know where the archduke is. I wish I could help, but I fear I have no precise information. The prince is so impulsive. Nevertheless, I believe he went hunting near Laxenburg. Oh, thank you! Please excuse us. There's no time to lose. JANUARY 30, 1889 You don't miss your gypsies? No, Bratfisch plays better than the whole bunch. Who was it, Loschek? A courier from Vienna, Your Highness. His Majesty reminds you that you are to return tomorrow morning without fail. - Tomorrow morning? - l vouched for your return. You did well. No, stay, Loschek. You too, Bratfisch. Come have a glass. Rudolf, I really like you tonight - and it's the first time. That's a great consolation. To your health, my friends. To Your Highness's health! Wait. That won't do. I have a real toast to propose. Here it is: To the best and most devoted of lovers, joy, happiness and long life. What are you doing? Nothing, darling. All done. I feel so good... but my eyelids are heavy. I wish I could stay awake. Give me a kiss, Rudolf, to last me the whole night. May your sleep be light and gentle. Not yet, please. I'm afraid of the dark. I love the light so. I wish I were already waking up to see the sun. You will see it. Rudolf... you remember that first time at the Prater? Remember what the devil said? ""Happy souls are all the nicer to torment." Until tomorrow, my love. Until tomorrow. What is it, Loschek? Forgive me, Your Highness... but I thought I heard a shot. That's odd. I didn't hear anything. It was probably out in the forest. What time is it? About half past 7:00, Your Highness. All right. I'll be down in half an hour. Very good, Your Highness, and please forgive me. THE LOWER DEPTHS was awarded the 1936 Louis Delluc Prize for Best French Film of the Year. THE LOWER DEPTHS I'd never ask you for accounts. We aren't shopkeepers. You serve your country, dear Baron, with true patriotic zeal. But money is missing. Too much. I know it was used for the common good, but the loss of 30,000 rubles is quite regrettable. Someone less tolerant might ask for explanations, or be shocked that you have no memory of the loan. You've something in mind, but it's still quite worrying. A secret matter, you may insist. But my dear Baron, our secret funds are not inexhaustible, alas. Despite our long friendship, I fear I can no longer turn a blind eye. My dear Baron, I trust you will not take this amiss. Thank you. Is that you, Pépel? Yes, it's me. I thought Kostylyov would never go to sleep. Does the money he cheats us out of keep him awake? You'll be glad to have him tomorrow. - Why tomorrow? - As if you didn't know. Your big job is tonight, isn't it? At the mansion. That's none of your business. Are you hiding something from me? You're wrong. I give you good advice. What would you do without us to buy what you steal? You and your husband profit as well. I take the risks, and you get the money. Right? You know it'll all be ours one day. Kostylyov's old. He won't live forever. We'll go somewhere nice, just the two of us. We'll start a new life. And no one will know our past. There's no point in daydreaming about us. - You don't love me anymore. - Me? I'm warning you, don't you dare leave me! I'd rather see you rot in prison than go off with someone else. If I go to jail, you and your husband won't be far behind me. No one will believe you. We have friends on the police force. Good night, Pépel. - Good night. Be careful tonight. Don't worry. We northerners aren't easy to catch. Don't treat it like a walk in the park. Alyoshka's coming. - So what? He'll wake up the old man. I told that rascal to never come back. Come on. Hey, lodgers! Hey, lodgers! Hey, lodgers! Is that you, Natasha? Sorry. I'm a polite guy. I meant to wake old Kostylyov. He gets the money, but I got you! You've been out boozing again. - You know me. - Aren't you ashamed? You know, I am who I am. If people don't like it, too bad. My boss gave me the sack, but I don't give a damn. What's a boss, anyway? A simple misunderstanding! Go to bed. Wait. Not yet. I wrote a jolly little funeral march. Wanna hear it? - Be quiet! - I want to tell the world! No one's listening right now. Tell them tomorrow. I won't be drunk then. I'll have nothing to say. No one will mind. Go downstairs. Go on. Natasha, your eyes are like stars. Off to bed you go. Is that you? Were you looking for me? Yes, it's me. And here you are, the two of you. Nice and cozy. Vassilissa! Bitch! Damned bitch! Forgive me, Lord. Vassilissa, you drive me to sin. You make me angry. You make me swear. I've looked everywhere for you. You should be in bed, but you're out here on the stairs. Tramp! Filthy animal! Clear out. Clear out, I said. I'm the boss around here. You clear out, thief, or I'll have you arrested. Clear out, or I'll strangle you! Help me! Help! One more dent. If the boss grumbles, I'll get you another. You dropped it on purpose. - No, I'm just clumsy. - You're clumsy, eh? Lucky for me. Otherwise, the way I was choking him... - Don't touch me! You're revolting. Sleep with my sister, I don't care. Steal if you want. But don't touch me. You're too young to understand. One thing I do know: Men like you are despicable. I'd like to explain, but I've got a job waiting. I hope you get caught. You know, God doesn't favor the prayers of his saints. Good night, Natasha. Still up and about, Nastia? I get my rest on my feet. Aren't you fed up, out here all alone? - Aren't you fed up with what you do? - No. It's when I'm here that it gets me. Everything seems fine, and then suddenly, it's like a chill comes over me and I've had enough. It's about time. Stand up straight. - You stood me up last night. - You're still thinking about that? You asked me to dinner. I didn't have enough left to buy you a sandwich. - How about tonight? - Tonight is different. I'll win, and we'll go wherever you like. Lend me 1,000 rubles. At the moment I need them myself. But if you win? Later, dear child. Banco. - Good evening, Baron. - Good evening. I regret to say this, but perhaps you shouldn't play tonight. Why is that? Please understand, your debt is... - That's precisely why I'm here. We'll settle that tonight. He who pays his debts grows rich. You're dining with him? What about me? Silly, when that guy has money, he throws it around. He's crazy. - And if he loses? - I won't go. - How will you know? It's easy to tell. Whether he wins or loses, he always leaves calmly. He takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. If he's won, he lights it. If not, he's so nervous he can't light it. Baron, may I give you a bit of advice? Please do. Don't gamble anymore. Impossible, my dear sir. Banco tonight, my dear Baron? Certainly, my dear Count. - Shall we play? - I'd love to. Allow me to repay... - It was 10,000 rubles, correct? - There's no hurry. - Debt of honor. The bank has 16,000. - Shall we, Count? - the land. Please enjoy this grand pageant, brought to you by Persona Century. Percentage of error? 0.008 percent. Within acceptable limits. We believe the climate change will occur as the computer predicted. I see. Damn it! Come this way. Tomorrow! Tomorrow my comrades will come! I'll hold out until then! Persona Century! He cries before he gets angry. Crying for the dead. Selia? Selia? Mai. What's wrong, Selia? Did you have an argument with Mr. Terrorist? It's strange to see you buying flowers. Not really. Even I buy flowers. You're dressed up. You going to see that man? Not at all! Not at all! Why don't we go and have a drink at Junko's bar? Don't joke! There are probably assassins everywhere. Let's go back. I'll walk you. I... Uhh... Tomorrow afternoon? He's going to meet his comrades at the southern junkyard. I see. So, he contacted them. Mai, I... Sorry, nothing. It's all right. Don't cry. Look at them. Let's get our revenge for the deaths of Ben and Tarbo. Selia! Mai! Mai, get out of there! Mai, are you all right? What kind of a lookout are you? I'm sorry! But I never thought-- Hey! She's getting away! Get out of my way, Jingo! I can't let her get away alive. Sorry about this... How rude! No one should run into Tamaki of the Hozuki family. This town is filled with filthy upstart rats. It will need to be cleansed sometime soon. Hurry home. My sister... She called us filthy rats. She really nailed us. Even the leader of the Messiah is awed by her presence? Who was "awed"? I was just angered by an outsider talking about cleaning us out! What? Anyway, please come and help him, if you have time. When I come, I'll perform a renewal. I hoped we could make more of a game of this before coming to a head. But I've got instructions from heaven. I've pretty well fallen for you, you know. But we've got to prune a poisonous weed before it grows. So it seems. Let's go. This darkness was crafted by Persona. Now, something new is trying to be born of this darkness. What? Here they come. Right on time. Would you give that to me? No! It always happens! The gun is the only thing that survives. Because it's full of emotions. It carries the resentment of those people who wanted a peaceful world. So, why don't you let me have it? Take care. You okay with this, Selia? It's okay, right? Selia! Wait, Tatsuya! Tatsuya! It's a trap! Stop it! Selia! Tatsuya... Dammit! Don't. If you involve yourself further we'll punish you as if you were terrorists. You assholes! Why is the Persona Guard here? This is Shinjuku! A free area! Yes, a free area. You can come and go as you please. As can the Guard. Do not worry. Our goal here was only to exterminate a terrorist. We had no intention of attacking those unconnected with the matter. Not that helicopter, either. Even though they just saw their comrade gunned down they'll leave without being able to do a thing about it. That's a humiliation worse than death. You bitch! Finish him off. However, do not hit the woman... If possible. Fire! Renewal. Darkside! What's this? Guren... You? ! I'm gonna make every human being colored with the darkness. Everyone! At the end of the winter sea where everyone feels so lonely. There was no other way back. It's only the way to the darkness. You understand my feelings? I do. Darling. I had to forget. The only thing I could do was forget! I was in love with you. I forced myself to believe it! But now I've had enough! You again? But he's dead and rotted to the molecule. You're doing useless magic. No, there are others still living. People who fight with hatred in their hearts. People who fight with mourning in their hands. Take me with you! I'll carry on Tatsuya's determination! We'll welcome you, comrade! Selia! Mai. Farewell, Selia! Two people, colored in the darkness, now come to birth. Um, excuse me, I'm looking for the funfair. That way. OK, that way. Thank you very much. That way. He said to go that way. Go that way. Thank you. Thank you. That way. No, that way. OK, thank you. OK, thank you very much.

You have to open your mind to the artist's inner feelings. Hey, wait a minute. If you tilt your head to the right and squint your eyes a little you can just about make out Elvis' profile. - I don't see it, chief. - Oh, yeah, look. Between these two hubcaps here and that upside-down speedometer. - Oh, yeah. - You see it? Maybe the fat Elvis. Why do I even try? Art to you guys is like prints of those poker-playing dogs. Oh, I love those. Did you ever see the one with the two dogs in the bar, throwing darts? Lois Lane? - Yes? - This is for you. Who's it from? I have no idea. "Dear Lois: Please forgive me, but my feelings for you run deep and I'm too shy to tell you in person. But I want the world to know that whenever I think of you my heart sings. Your secret admirer. " Don't look at me. I may be from Kansas, but I am not that corny. - This is so embarrassing. - Well, open it up. Oh, it's so beautiful. Well, whoever this guy is, he sure has a sense of style. Lift up that latch. That's the damnedest thing I've ever seen. That's really cool. Waiter. Excuse me, I wanted one of those. This fella sure knows how to clear a room. Chief, you don't have to yell. Who's yelling? I'd hate to think of what this guy would've sent you if he didn't like you. - Morning. - Morning. - Did the lab call? - Yeah. Unfortunately, the wiring was so melted they couldn't tell anything. You got any idea who Romeo is? I haven't been able to think of anyone who likes me enough to send me a... I'm still working on it. Lois, I just got off the phone with the museum. I told them we'd take care of the damages. Is something wrong? "Dear Lois: Please accept the gift on your desk as an apology for last night. I am itching to be yours. Your secret admirer. " Well, are you gonna open it? - I don't know. - You want me to open it? No. No. I'll do it. It's beautiful. It's a little tight, but... Your secret admirer must work here. Nobody else has access to your desk. - That's good deductive reasoning. - Thanks. But you're wrong. I know what everybody gets paid. And nobody gets paid enough to be able to afford a rock like that. Not even me. It's just the most romantic thing. "Itching to be yours. " Give me a break. - Clark, I'm sure it came from his heart. - Amazing. You went from being afraid to open the box to thinking this guy was Longfellow in a matter of 30 seconds. Oh, Clark, you just don't understand romance. Lois, are you okay? I think I'm having an allergic reaction to the gold. - It's too tight. - Let me help. It must've been a cheap setting. Well, so far lover boy's batting 0 for 2. It's discolored. It's been dipped in some kind of chemical. Yeah, real romantic. Hey, watch it! What do you think this is, the Tour de France? I guess this is gonna be a long day. What, I'm a little edgy. I'm sorry, Clark. I can't get this image out of my head of some weirdo sitting in his living room snickering about how he's gonna get Lois Lane to fall for him. I guess that's the drawbacks of being beautiful, successful and eligible. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. I was paying you a compliment. You implied if I wasn't single, I wouldn't have this problem. No, I wasn't. But you probably wouldn't have this problem if you were married. Well, that's a terrific reason to get married, to avoid harassment. Yep, a long day. - May I help you? - Yes. I was wondering if you could tell by looking at a ring where it was made. Well, I can certainly tell by looking at it it wasn't made here. Let me get my loupe. Gee, he's got some beautiful things. These cameos are gorgeous. You ought to take a look at the things in this case. They are not. Yuck. These remind me of this computer nerd I used to know in college Randall Loomis. Followed me around for an entire year like this annoying little gnat. And then, one day, I found in my locker a hideous piece of jewelry just like this. With this note attached to it that said, "From your secret admirer. " Clark, that's it. Randall Loomis. He must be the one behind this. He still lives in Metropolis. I can get the information you want. But it would help if I could hold on to this for a day. - That's fine. Let's go. - Okay. Thank you. After years of pining for me Loomis has finally decided to act on his sick little fantasies. Turn here. That's it? Looks like Randall the nerd is doing all right for himself. What are you gonna say if it turns out he's not behind this? It makes perfect sense: His intense infatuation for me, his mechanical abilities and, evidently, he has enough money to spend on all those elaborate gifts. People do change, Lois. This wouldn't be change, Clark. This would be morphing. Yes? Hi. Does Randall Loomis live here? - Yes, I'm Mrs. Loomis. Can I help you? - Mrs. Loomis, of course. - Hi, I'm Clark Kent. - Hi. This is... Lois Lane. Randall and Lois are old friends. We were in the neighborhood, and Lois thought we should drop by and say hello. Isn't that right, Lois? Well, I'm sure he'd be delighted. I'll be right back. Maybe it's a different Randall Loomis. It is a common name. Hi. You were looking for me? Lois. Hi, Randall. - Do I know you from somewhere? - Lois Lane. We went to college together. Lois. I didn't recognize you. You... You look so mature. And you look like you're doing very well. - Yeah. Yeah. I sold my software company last year and retired. Donna and I are gonna travel around the world and then settle down in our place in Paris. So, what have you been up to? I'm a reporter. A journalist. Senior journalist for the Daily Planet. - Actually, I'm in charge of... - Almost the entire newspaper. Oh, that... That's great! - Well, would you folks like to come in? - No, we... We can't. Big story. Deadline. Well, it was nice of you to stop by. I'm glad to see that you've found yourself a good man. In college, I seem to remember Lois always on the prowl but she never could hook up with the right guy. I hope it works out for you two. Thank you. Let's go. - So you were on the prowl in college? - That man has a very faulty memory. And did you see her nails? Obviously press-on. I wasn't really focusing on her nails, Lois. I'm glad you're having such a good time. What did you do that for? Well, you left the security system off again and I just walked right in the door. Well, I can never figure how that stupid thing works. Funny. You got a Master's in engineering and you can't turn on an alarm system. Well, sometimes geniuses have trouble with simple things. - It makes us colorful. - How do you feel about the colors black and blue? I've been waiting five years to even the score with Lois Lane. And I'm not gonna let everything be ruined just because you are too stupid to set a simple alarm. Okay. Okay, I'll rig it some way so it's easy to operate. I don't care if you clap it on. Just use it. - How was the meeting with the terrorists? - Don't call them that. They like to be called "freedom fighters. " And they want a little... They want a demonstration before they'll advance us any money. - They don't trust us? - Victor we're the kind of people that deal with terrorists. Why would anybody trust us? Is that thing ready? I modified the manufacturer's spraying system and installed... Boring! Is it ready? It's ready. Good. Now think you can figure out how to get into this? Come on, sweetie. Come on. Is this another part of your colorful genius persona? There it is. Let's go. Look out! Are you okay? Come on! - You okay? - Get him out of there. I'm sorry. But you should've seen your face when Randall said he was selling his company and moving to Paris. Stop it. You think I care what Randall Loomis does with his life? - I've more important things to deal with. - Of course you do. - You're a "senior journalist. " - You know, you could walk back. Found it. Give me the tweezers. I'm sorry. Sorry. - Is that our little gift for Lois Lane? - Yes. - Listen, I've been thinking. - Bad idea, Victor. - No, you... - Bad idea. Bad idea! Look out! - Steer into the skid. - I am! It's not working! - That was close. - Too close. What'd you open the door for? I don't know. I thought maybe for a moment there maybe... What? You were gonna drag your foot along the street and stop the car? You've been watching too many Flintstones cartoons. Yeah. Look, stay here. I'll go for help. I'm not gonna wait here while you go running off and get the whole... You okay? Are you all right? Yeah, for someone who just saw their life flash before their eyes. - What caused this? - I'm not sure. Some kind of chemical reaction. Promise me someday you'll tell me how you do that. Here's the little dickens. Whoops. Don't move. - Why? - I dropped the chip. Oh, you dropped the chip. Can you see the chip? No. Victor, that little chip is worth well over $ 100,000. And it's irreplaceable, unlike you. So I'd like you to look for the chip again. It was by your foot. Lucky, no harm done. Oh, Victor did I ever tell you how much time I spent in prison? - You said about five years. - About five years. And you know that in that whole time I never got one day off for good behavior. - You know why? - No. Because I'm... I'm just not a very nice person, see? I'm just not a very nice person. And my problem today is that I just don't feel that you understand how much this project means to me. - I understand. - Do you? - I understand. - Do you? It'll never happen again. - No? - No. Good. Hey, we've had a long day. How about I take you out to the old ball game? - Lois! Lois! Lois! - Hey, slugger. Batter up. - Someone tell me what's going on. - Didn't you read the sports section? - Not yet, why? - You're the action shot of the day. "Lois Lane, let me be your designated hitter. - Your secret admirer. " - What? It's kind of cool the way he tied in the baseball theme. You know, the whole "designated hitter"... I wish someone would yell out "copy boy" right about now. Lois. A lot of people tell me I'm too old to be romantic. And they're right. Do me a favor. Would you tell lover boy to send a candygram next time? Was the message on the board very long? Long? The game was postponed for half an hour. - The fans were going nuts. - Nuts in a good way? The boys in the press box called him the Prankster. Me, I suggested a different name. Pete, don't you have a box score to study? How did he manage this? - Well, I... - With a stolen computer chip. I spoke to the manager of the stadium this morning. He told me the scoreboard was programmed by Stanton Electronics. Ring a bell? Their truck was in that mess on the street yesterday. It turns out two computer chips were stolen and replaced with altered chips. One controlled your scoreboard. The other was headed for a military lab. - So that's it. - That's what? What happened wasn't an accident. It was a diversion so someone could steal the chips from the truck. Yeah. I knew that. If yesterday was a diversion, what happened at the museum was one too. The Regent Diamond is missing from their collection. Fifty carats. Let me guess. A piece of it was in the ring I got? The jeweler said it was cut from the same stone. You know, it's true what they say. Love stinks. I don't get it. He steals a diamond ring and computer chips. - What's the connection? - Lois, Clark. You gotta see this. This just broke in to all the news channels. - Good morning, Metropolis. - Where's it coming from? I'm sorry to interrupt your little news bulletin there but what I've got to say is just more important. Now, the bomb you see on your TV screens is hidden in the basement of one of the city's scientific laboratories. Just so everyone isn't inconvenienced, I'll tell you the laboratory is located in our city's lovely riverfront industrial area. - All right, somebody get on this. - I'll go. - Lois, find how he cut into the broadcast. - Okay, fine. As you see, the bomb on your screens will detonate in one minute, 15 seconds. If you're in that area... Fourteen seconds. - consider taking an early lunch. Eleven seconds. If you're wondering how come I'm pulling this loony prank I'm an incurable romantic, and I just want to show the world the explosive nature of my love for Lois Lane. Okay, the workers are out. Let's go. Oh, my God. Bravo, Superman. Hey, you were super close. Unfortunately next time, Superman super close will have super deadly results. Bye-bye for now. You recognize his voice? Why is he doing this to me? Hang in there, kid. Jimmy, come on. Hey, Juliet. While you and Romeo here were making a love connection, some guy called and he said he had some information about who this wack-a-doo is. Well, I think we've finally found the absolute bottom of Metropolis. Why is it that guys who call in with tips always live in the worst part of town? What should the brochure on this place say? "Exquisite alley view. Complimentary roaches on your pillow. " - Is this 210? - You Lane? Yes. This is my partner, Clark Kent. And you are? Not very friendly. Sit down. Well, that's okay. We'll stand. Let's see the money. What money? I told the kid on the phone, you wanna know who's doing this, it's gonna cost. I'm sorry, but the Daily Planet has a policy that we don't pay for information. Then you came here for nothing. Well, let's not be too hasty. How much money could we be talking about? - Ten grand. - Ten thousand dollars? Are you joking? Does this look like a face that makes jokes? No. No. No, not jokes. Look, I know this guy. I spent a lot of time with him. All he did was talk about you and what he was gonna do to you. Now, do you wanna know this guy's name or not? How do you know him? What? You see a sign on my forehead says "stupid"? - Yeah? - We can get the information for less. - These things are negotiable. - Who's this? Fine. Talk him down to $20, because that's all I have on me. Money isn't everything. Maybe we can offer a stay in a nicer place. Sure, maybe we can throw in a cruise while we're at it. Will you get serious? We're talking about my life. Now, let's offer him $ 100. He'll take it. Just look at him. He's so pathetic. He's beyond pathetic. He's dead. Database access code accepted. I just heard. Any idea who this fella was? He registered as Mick Barrows. We're checking to see if that's accurate. Collating data. How can you rig up something to electrocute a person over the telephone? - This Prankster's talented. - I'm not sure I'd use the word "talent. " Here he is. Mick Barrows. Got out of prison a month ago after serving 18 years. Too bad there's not a button to push to find out what he was gonna say. - I was kidding. - Just because Barrows didn't talk doesn't mean he didn't give us a lead. - I don't understand. Barrows spent a lot of time with the Prankster. - It had to be someone he knew in prison. - Probably one of his cellmates. - Why can't I think like this? - lf it was easy, everybody would do it. Hey, copy boy. - Oh, my God. - Who's Kyle Griffin? Wait a minute. Wasn't he busted five years ago for selling high-tech weaponry to the Third World? His firm did the selling, he did the designing. Why would he be after you? My first big story was an exposé on the illegal arms business. It led to the FBI arresting 12 people. Kyle was at the top of that list. So now he's out and he wants his revenge. But why steal a diamond and a computer chip? It's just a guess, but they are components of high-tech weaponry. Hey, guys! Listen to this. One of the buildings that emptied out due to the bomb scare was Whitmore Scientific Labs. And they just found out something was stolen. Yeah. Yeah, 4 pounds of titanium alloy and something called cesium. How'd you know that? All we can do is leave his parole officer a message. With any luck, he'll get back with us in the morning. Lois, you sure you don't wanna stay with Alice and me? No, thanks, chief. I'll be fine. It's obvious Griffin's just interested in annoying me while he collects pieces for his next toy. - Do you want me to take you home? - No, I'm fine. I promise. I'll see you all tomorrow. Nobody's here, right? Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything's fine. Oh, God, I hate this. Oh, girl, just get a grip. This is silly. I have gotta get some control. Lois? Is that you? Lois? - Perry? - Yeah. I was just ready to go home and I was thinking about your situation you know, with this Prankster, and I thought I'd call to see if you're okay. Chief, I'm fine. Haven't given it a second thought. Attagirl. If you change your mind, Alice has that guest bedroom ready for you. Oh, tell her that I appreciate it, that's not... Perry? Hi, we got cut off. I know, I did the cutting. Griffin, is that you? You figured it out. And after I went to all the trouble of killing poor Barrows. - What do you want? - I don't know. I wanna torment you the way you tormented me when you wrote your little exposé. And after your reputation's ruined and your life is sufficiently miserable I'm gonna put you out of your misery. Well, it's a slam dunk. Nothing but net. Clark! - Lois, it's after 11. - I know. I know it's late. I'm sorry, but I had this sudden urge for pizza and a Mel Gibson movie. I know how much you like pizza and Lethal Weapon, so here I am. - Great. Come in. - So, what should we start with? Lethal Weapon 1 or Lethal Weapon 2 or there's 3. It's stupid at the beginning, but it gets better. Lois, is something wrong? Does something have to be wrong for me to spend some time with a friend? No. No. It's all right. One would be great. Coming soon to a theater near you, the action-adventure of the year. This is really great. We should do this more often. - What are you doing tomorrow night? - Lois. Clark, don't. Hello? Hello? There's nobody there. Probably just a wrong number. A wrong number. No problem. That happens all the time in the big city, right? - You wanna tell me what happened? - Nothing happened. You know. I mean, you know, nothing important. - Griffin called me. - What? What did he say? The usual. You know, he said, "Lois, hi. How are you? Long time no see. I'm gonna kill you. " - Kill you? Did you call the police? - Clark, I am a professional reporter. This is not the first threat I've received. These things, they never pan out. Well, maybe not. But I'd feel a lot better if you stayed here tonight. Well, if it would make you feel better, then I guess it... Don't let me twist your arm or anything. Clark. I don't wanna die. Lois, I would not let that happen. Movie. You know, Mel Gibson is really funny in these movies. Yeah. He plays a great wild man. Sometimes I think maybe I should be a little bit more of a wild man myself. Jimmy even suggested that I wear an earring, but that's not really me, I... What did he say? Okay, great. Tell chief we're on it. Thanks. - Who was that? - That was Jimmy. Griffin's parole officer called this morning. The only address he has is Griffin's father's toy store. Toy store? I thought Griffin's father was a nuclear physicist. Didn't Griffin follow in his footsteps? Apparently, he retired, and he's gone into the toy business. It's not far from here. - How'd you sleep? - I had really weird dreams. - Maybe it's the pizza. - I doubt it. I was a cocktail waitress, and Griffin was a bartender. All of a sudden, he's trying to shove me in the blender and I'm screaming, "We don't serve blended drinks here! " Well, let's hope it was the pizza. - Hey, that's my breakfast. - I'll buy you a doughnut on the way. Do you mind if we stop by my apartment so I can change? Oh, no, of course not. I know you "senior journalists" have an image to uphold. And this is my workshop. It's where I make everything. Now, this... This is my favorite. It's a phone. It's interesting. When people return calls on this, they can say: "I'm colon you back. " You get it? Mr. Griffin, we're here to talk to you about Kyle. - We have reason to believe... - Oh, Kyle's a good boy, Mr. Kent. He just got caught up with the wrong crowd. Now, here's something you're not gonna find anywhere else because I make them. You see this, this is real red clay. It's hard to come by in these parts. I dig it up myself over near Lunar Industrial Park. Mr. Griffin, when was the last time you heard from your son? Look, I realize you probably don't wanna talk to me about Kyle. I have nothing to hide, Miss Lane. I haven't seen Kyle since he got out of prison. Now, here's something I just came up with... If I were to tell you that I had titanium, cesium, a diamond and a computer chip what might I be making? Well, any number of things. Could a weapon be made from these items? Yeah, it could. Of course you'd be missing a power source. - Such as? Well, if it were a nuclear-type device, a piece of plutonium. The only plutonium in this city is at the toxic depository. No, that's not entirely true, Mr. Kent. There is another place. There's a heavy-metals processing plant out on Highway 9, I believe. We'll split up. I'll take the processing plant. - You've been a great help. - Oh, well, it's a pleasure. You were right. They were just here. In about 15 minutes, she's gonna walk right into your arms. Perfect. Thank you. How long is this gonna take? Well, the interior dimension of the plant is approximately 65,000 square feet. With an accelerated dispersion flow, taking into account any leakage from... Fifteen minutes. Come on! Excuse me. Can you tell me where the plant manager is? The plant manager! Hello, Lois. Having a good time? Well, that's just fine. Thank you for saving the last laugh for me. Give me the box. I'll give you the babe. If you don't mind my saying so, I think you have great legs. I think I read somewhere that intelligent men are leg men. Only boobs are interested in... Well, you know. Anyway, I think you have very shapely legs. They're like two perfectly formed carrots. Stop, you're embarrassing me. They found a canister of nitrous oxide hooked to the air conditioning. - It came through the vents. - Did they take anything? Yeah, some of our plutonium. I tried to stop them, but I was laughing too hard. Do me a favor. Look like you did when you smelled the gas, huh? Jimmy, can you take a picture of something else? Right. Yeah. Are you sure the two men took Miss Lane with them? Yeah, I'm sorry. That gas stopped us from being much help. - That's okay. Thanks. - You're welcome. What is it? It's little bits of red clay. How could you see that from all the way over there? I have a really strong prescription. Well, is it important? Anybody could've tracked that in here. Not anybody. They wear those so plutonium doesn't stick to their shoes and get outside. So? So it had to come from the shoes of the men who broke in here. Yeah, of course. But where do you find red clay in Metropolis? There. Oh, boy, what a great story this is gonna be. - Too bad your paper won't publish it. - What's the Planet got to do with this? My buyers want a demonstration, so I was like, "I'd better decimate a building. " Then I thought, "What better building to destroy than the paper that sent me to prison?" - It'll be really nifty. See, the weapon fires this gas plasma beam that vaporizes whatever it hits. I don't think she believes you, Victor. But maybe... Maybe she will if she sees it at work, up close and personal. Cool, huh? I helped Kyle design it. No, no, no, Victor. I don't think you got any future with her. Kind of hard to have a meaningful relationship with a dead woman. You know, the people at the Planet won't enjoy this prank as much as I will. Nothing. All that power, and nothing happened. Just the first salvo, Victor. Even steel melts if it gets hot enough. No! No! - No. - Can I get you a pillow? You're right, Victor. I do have great legs. - Well, I guess you don't need me. - Not this time but don't leave town. So how does it feel to see your name in lights? I wasn't reading that. I was thinking about my next story. Hey. You two gotta hear this. Jimmy's got a theory he's been working on. Go ahead, son. Well, I've been thinking about what happened. I couldn't figure out how the Prankster knew you'd be at the plant. And then it dawned on me. His father was the only person that knew you were gonna be there. So he was probably in on it. Nice work, Jimmy. I'm proud of you, son. I'm gonna even let you call the police. Come on. Lois, these just came for you. Diane, what do yellow roses mean? I don't know. The only thing men ever give me are directions to their house. Yellow is for friendship. "From a special friend. " A final sick joke from Kyle Griffin. No, wait... Lois, wait. No, no! Those roses cost me 50 bucks. I'm sorry. Subtitulos por Loysriono para Tusseries-cifirip (whistles) (footsteps approaching) (screaming) (screaming) This sounds like more than we can handle. (chuckling) Amusing. It's not without a certain understated omniscience. (screaming) Unhand her, cad, or I'll have to disarm you. (chuckling) Save that for my next book. Stay back, Duckman, or it's going to get ugly. I said stay back! One more step, and I'll... I'll... and I'll... pull back this curtain. That's right, it's This Could Be Your Life-- the show that each week takes a memorable personality we can cross-promote with the evening news and asks the burning question: What makes him or her so unique, so special, so one-of-a-kind, we'll watch them on TV rather than have go out and have a life of our own? Tonight's guest that incomparable crime-fighting hero-- Duckman! AUDIENCE: Duckman! Duckman! Duckman! (whispering) What? Really? Well, Duckman, according to your family, you're not an incomparable crime-fighting hero. You're not special or unique. In fact, there's absolutely nothing memorable about you at all. (screaming) Whoa! Smoke! Smoke! I need a smoke. Ow! (slurping) Mmm. BERNICE: What's the matter? You seem a little down this morning. It's okay. You can tell me about it. I'm here for you. If you really want to know... Uh-huh. I had that dream again-- Oh... the one where no one cares about anything I say or do. Quiet, you worthless sack of pillow stuffing! I'm on the phone! We'll talk at lunch. Duckman, you left feathers on the sink last night, you were supposed to get your dog neutered-- I caught him looking funny at the hamster again-- and you've been smoking! I can smell it on your breath! I was not smoking! You can't accuse me of something I wasn't even doing. Oh, yeah? Then you were sucking on the bottom of an ashtray like some pathetic and disgusting nicotine junkie. That's better. I'm telling you for the last time, Duckman, I don't want this house smelling like one of your stale, old cigarette butts. (breaking wind) Like my stale old butts are the problem around here. Grandma-ma can't help it. She's comatose. Ow! And you will be, too, if you touch the children's breakfast. Fine. I'll make my own damn breakfast... again! No fats, no preservatives, no red and yellow dyes. Hmm. Shows you what happens when you let a bunch of pasty-faced, pansy-wiped scientists get you all worked up over a few carcinogens. Yeast cakes-- every bite a nutritional potpourri. Uh, morning, son. How's school? (choking) (spits) Ahh! There's my stopwatch. CHARLES: Is not! MAMBO: Is so! CHARLES: Is not! MAMBO: Is so! Your theory totally overlooks the ontological side. And yours underestimates the Cartesian perspective on antisocial pathology. Freudian. Jungian. (grunting) Charles, Mambo, knock it off. You're giving me a headache. Boys, not in front of Grandma-ma. Yeast cakes! Yeast cakes! BOTH: Good morning, Grandma-ma. That's it. I've had it. For all the response I get around here, I might as well be invisible! I know your mother died. I know she left you and the house to her sister. But I still live here! I'm still the man of the house! And I demand to be heard! (voice fading:) To be recognized! To be... (breaking wind) DUCKMAN: So, my sister-in-law is a walking Cuisinart. My children do treat me like some kind of skin rash. At least I'm freeway-close! (crashing) MAN: My tire! I don't get it. I brake for animals if they're big enough to dent my car. I don't pop any zits above the eye line. I treat others the way I'd like to be treated. (tires screeching) Same to you, sister! Devote a lifetime to the church, they think they own the road. It would just be nice for once to be noticed-- get the kind of attention I deserve. Note to myself: More thumbtacks in the bird feeder. What the hell are you staring at? ! Hello, Mr. Duckman. Being aware of your little digestive problem, we made you a bran muffin and a mug of steaming liquid grits. Be good to your bowels and they'll be good to you. We also called your doctor to tell him we think you've been a naughty detective. You've been smoking again. And he said... Quote... "Keep it up and his heart will burst and splatter all over the inside of his tar-filled lungs." End quote. So we set traps in all your cigarette packages. (grunting) (truck horn blaring) Don't worry about Fluffy, sir. That's the good thing about being stuffed. We're very resilient. That Mr. Duckman-- he's getting much better at expressing his emotions. So what if they work for free? The last thing I need this morning is a couple of touchy-feely secretaries some cat coughed up. (door opens) Fine, thank you. Just peachy. And how are you today? Aces, Duckman. I'm doomed, Cornfed, doomed to live an unnoticed life-- an anonymous drone stepped over and unappreciated till the day I die. Is it me or does your hair have more body? Are you listening to me? ! I'm invisible, Corny. I'm falling through the cracks without leaving a mark. My own family ignores me, and who can blame them? There's nothing special about me, nothing unique. I'm just one more duck detective who works with a pig and lives with the twin sister of his dead wife, three sons in two bodies and a comatose mother-in-law who's got so much gas, she's a fire hazard. Sure, but there are things that stand out about you, too. Like what? Name one thing about me that stands out, that I'll be remembered for. (engine droning outside) Is that a zeppelin? Oh, nice! You see, I'm not unique! I'm not special! I don't even have a coffee mug with my name on it! It's the dream again, Duckman. You're letting it win. I know, I used to have a recurring dream. I'd dream I fell and hit my head on a fishbowl-- hurt myself just bad enough to work graveyard shift at a convenient store. A group of Hare Krishnas always came in at 4:00 A.M. and bought 16 gallons of Mr. Slushy and a package of banana-flavored Ding Dongs. Then the Swedish bikini team jumped out of a magazine and read Moby Dick to me inside a giant carton of cottage cheese. "Why?" I'd ask myself. "What could it mean? "Am I mad? Or is the world simply a mystery too complex to understand?" Mm-hmm. Um, getting back to me! (intercom buzzing) FLUFFY: Mr. Duckman, a package just came. URANUS: But we think we should send it back. It's wrapped in non-biodegradable plastic tape. Just open it! Not that I ever get anything good. No one out there cares if I live or die either. Good news: someone cares. It's true, Corny! Someone sent a bomb to me! Someone actually wants me dead! But who? I can't think of anyone who would want to kill me. Well, there's your paper boy, the neighbor with the dog you set the bear traps for, the cab driver's union, the father of that ballerina... Never mind. I know who it has to be. Let's go. ...two of your uncles, Scout troop 44... Mr. Duckman, if you could find our arms and legs? This radiator's getting a tad warm. (alarm sounding) DUCKMAN: Thanks for letting us see the prisoner, Warden. Obviously, this is a very serious matter. (stifled laughter) I'm the one who had him arrested. I'm sure he's seeking revenge by trying to violently end my life. Why do you think it's him? I'm a detective, Warden. We make a living on our hunches. I was able to eliminate others I've captured because our cater-to-everyone- but-the-victim legal system let them off on technicalities. They weren't guilty. Yeah, yeah, that kind of thing. Can we just get on with this? Lucky for them, they're behind bars. I'd love to teach these brain-dead, bread-and-water-eating scumbags some manners. Did I mention we're on the honor system? A little prison humor, fellas. Fact is, some of my best friends are brain-dead, bread-and-water-eating scumbags. PRISONERS: Oh, okay. That's all right. DUCKMAN: What happens, Warden? What snaps in a man? What makes him sink so low that he ends up spending an empty lifetime in a hellhole like this? Good dental plan. Oh, oh. You meant the prisoners. Who knows? Too many violent cartoons when they were kids. Rehab. We like to acclimate prisoners, not just back into society, but into high society. There are those, of course, who are too far gone to be rehabilitated... the white-collar criminals. There's gang activity brewing. They're wearing their colors today. Inside traders in the red ties. S L executives in the blue. Zero coupon bonds! Muni's! Zero coupon bonds! Muni's! WARDEN: It's a very delicate situation. One misstep could cause a full-scale riot. (gunfire) (alarms sounding) (chuckling) Frees up a few more cells. WARDEN: The cell of Wolfgang Cracker-- the cannibalistic maniac who has committed some of the most horrendous crimes known to mankind. (sarcastically): Ooh, I'm shaking. I caught him once. I think I'm ready for whatever he's got. (screaming) (screams) (chuckling) Sorry. Did I scare you? A little fun I have. People seem to expect it. Please, do come in. You have a photo session at 4:00-- with the mask. The mayor's asked you to do two more cannibal awareness spots. The Beef Council called again and so did Heinz. Impressive, no? -- what a monstrously grotesque crime and a good agent can do. I don't believe I caught your name. You know who I am, pal. I'm the guy who put you away! Oh, yes! Dogman... Darkwing, Daffy... Duckman! Duckman! Precisely. The one I tripped over. We don't need to go into that now. His sister-in-law was chasing him with a waffle iron when he slipped on his son's skateboard and rolled into the street just as Cracker was running to his getaway car causing Cracker to trip over Duckman, flying into a passing police car. You think that was an accident? Ha! And now you've sworn revenge. You're trying to kill me! Yes, the parole board called. They'd like to discuss releasing you tomorrow at 2:00. Can't. PTA is here at 2:00. Try breakfast, month from Wednesday. Getting caught is the best thing that ever happened to me, Duct Tape. I've become rich and famous in prison. I've even helped erase the silly stigma attached to my particular avocation. You know, eat 20, 25 people they label you. But thanks to my book My Favorite Finger Foods-- 35 weeks as a national best seller-- what was once an unspeakable taboo is now a life-style choice. Arnold's on one-- wants to be in your next exercise video. Two's Gabor about your new line of greeting cards. Call backs. And, of course, I've found religion as well. Now I only eat fishermen on Fridays. Only kidding. My success guarantees that I'll be loved by millions while you'll live and die in obscurity. So, with regards to my having you killed, Dark Meat... why bother? Special delivery. Ah... I'd say another organ of some kind. Fans... if you'll excuse me. I don't buy what you're selling, Cracker. Every instinct I've honed over all my years as a detective tells me you're the only one who could be trying to kill me! (groaning) Of course, I could be convinced otherwise. I'm feeling a little frazzled-- like things are starting to unravel. I sure could use a chestful o' smoke about now. Ow! This bomber's going to kill me, Cornfed! He finds me everywhere-- in my office, in the prison... In your car. (screams) DUCKMAN: Close one, Corny. At least this time no one got hurt. I don't want to miss dinner. I got to take one more shot at talking to my kids-- connecting with them, you know, before... Hey, twins... I just had a thought. Bet it hurt. First one's always the hardest. Is it possible to love a sandwich so much you don't want to eat it 'cause then it'll be gone? Hey, kids, I was thinking we could spend a little bit of quality... Dibs on the window closest to the exhaust. Oh, Duckman, you're three minutes late. I gave your dinner to a man who came to the door selling blenders. And you got a message from someone who said you made a mistake in your past and you're gonna pay for it by being blown into a thousand little bits of flesh. I'll be back at 9:30. But wait! Kids! I wanted to... (siren blaring) The answer's up here. The bomber said I made a mistake in my past. My whole past is in this attic. What a pigsty! Oh, uh... figure of speech. (grunting) Huh. Ironic, isn't it? Your search through the past for clues to the killer's identity may actually provide clues to your own identity... the search in the end becoming man's ultimate search-- the search for himself. You have a large wad of broccoli stuck between your teeth. Here they are! I knew I had them. The answer's got to be in here-- home movies! Actually, I've been putting off re-grouting that bathroom tile too long. This first one goes back to when I was really young. I want to be captain! Okeydokey, Duckboy. I just want to be fair even though you have been captain 37 times in a row. I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it! What the hell are you staring at? Well, Duckman, just a reminder that treating others like this young mouse does is the surest road to a successful and rewarding life. I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it! So what? So the squeaky-voiced little rodent kissed a few rear ends, made a buck or two. Maybe there's something in these. Help, Duckman, help! Eat your spinach so you can break through the ropes and save me! Help! Whoever got to be a hero eating spinach? (train whistle blaring) There's got to be something good I did in here. Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir. Where should my son and I take our pic-a-nic basket? One last camping trip together before he goes to college and becomes better than your average duck. Uh, Dad... I've decided not to go to college. No college? That would be a big boo-boo. You're going to college if I have to drag you there myself. (yelling) Huh! So I met Beatrice instead. That wasn't a mistake. TV ANNOUNCER: Now for this week's jackpot of $32 million dollars. The winning numbers are 4, 11, 22, 51 and 88. That's me! Whoo-hoo! I won! (chewing and swallowing) (screaming) Duckman, you're not using my vacuum for that again. I'll change the filter. Honey, what am I going to do with you? Sometimes I think if anything ever happened to me, I'd have to will those kids and this house to my sister. (both chuckling) Don't worry, Beatrice. Nothing's ever going to happen to you. Things sure have changed over the years. I miss her. You know, tomorrow would have been our wedding anniversary. I forgot. I guess I blocked it out. It's the first one I'll be spending without her. That may explain the way you've been feeling lately. (screams) It's a dud, Corny. We're safe. Hey, look! There's a note on the package. "I'll see you at your grave." (evil laughter in distance) It's him! Time for the obligatory chase. (tires squealing) What a yutz-- trying to hide in a glow-in-the-dark T-shirt. Might as well send up a warning flare. (snorts) What, no map? (animals howling) (screaming) (screaming) What the..? This is my plot. Beatrice's is right next to it, but I never bought a headstone. I did, Duckman. It's a trap. I never saw it coming. Oh, "rest in pieces," blow me up. Did I mention how much I enjoyed your sense of irony? Actually, I'm not going to blow you up. I'm going to chop you up. (screaming) (chain saw buzzing) (yelling) Play with tigers, you get covered in yellow hair. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I had to do something to get you back after you took those pictures of me having an affair. I know my wife paid you to do it, but it ruined my life. She left me. She was the only thing that made me special. Now I'm a nobody. It's like I never even existed! Wait a minute, pal. Hold the phone. You're saying I got paid on this job? Gee, I'd remember that. You know, you're right. You're not the guy. Sorry. It's just that you look a lot like him. In fact, you look like a million other duck detectives. It's not like you stand out or anything. It's an honest mistake. No hard feelings? These things happen. Listen, I'm, uh... I'm a little too depressed to take you down to the police. Can I trust you to turn yourself in? Yeah, sure. Boy, do I feel stupid. You hear that, Cornfed? I'm not special. Even my own killer doesn't think so. Get ahold of yourself, Duckman. It's true, Cornfed. I'm just like that bomber. I lost my identity when I lost my wife. But you still have something he doesn't, remember? His chain saw? Your children. You're still the only father they have. That makes you special. No one else could have created the family you did. I mean that in a good way. Oh, what's the point? Their own mother didn't think I was up to raising them. And maybe I'm not. Maybe that's why they ignore me. Beatrice made me a better person. Without her here to help, I'm... I'm just not a very good father. (everyone talking inside house) Happy anniversary, Dad. First one without Mom. We know it's tough. We miss her, too. But I did want to tell you, the twins and me think you're doing a good job, Dad, and we love you. DUCKMAN: Thank you... son. Good evening, family. And welcome to the first annual Bundy-financial-crisis summit meeting. Hello, Shop at Home network? Yes, I'd like to order your Brazilian amethyst dinner ring. And can I get a dinner to go with that? While I have your attention let's go over some of last month's bills. I'm sure we'll find a little fat here in our budget. "Renewal notice for Big 'Uns." Let's try another one here. "The Larry Storch School of Acting." Al, becoming an actress is very important to Kelly and you will not break her heart by telling her she can't do it. All right, Peg. In that case, you get a job to help pay for it. Poor Kelly. By the way, you could do your part by cutting down on this shopping network. Hey, I don't shop that much. Hey, Mom, the stuff you ordered is here. Oh, goody! Hey, Dad, guess what happened. I am up for a role in a sitcom. It's called Pease in a Pod. It's about this family named the Peases and they live in this house, and their lives and what goes on in their house and their lives. Fox? Yeah, how'd you know? Oh, joy! My Boxcar Willie tapes are here. And my tiara. I tell you, it is just like Christmas, except with presents. - What else you got in...? - This is Mommy's stuff. Get out of here. Anyway, I'm up for the role of the daughter. How's this for cosmic irony? In real life, I actually am one. What are the odds? - Indeed, but, pumpkin... - Daddy, I have to get this part. I am perfect for it. Look. "Blond perky lit..." "Literate." Plus, add that to the skills that I learned at Larry Storch's and I'm a shoo-in. Hey, Bud, tryouts are tomorrow. Come help me rehearse my lines. What's in it for me? I'll let you touch a picture of my friend Cindy. Where? Well, let's see. I have an unemployed actress for a daughter a son who'd have sex with a fire hydrant... Oh, happy day. My TV Guide-cover collector plates are here. That. I wonder where the next bolt of lightning will strike? I guess this isn't a good time to tell him I haven't been comfortable with my sexuality lately. "Snap, crackle, pop"? Mom, why do they always say that? I mean, the snap, okay and maybe the crackle, but you never hear the pop. And what's the deal with Trix...? That'll be fine, Miss Bundy. Thank you. Well, you know, I can do the scene a couple different ways. Can any of them be funny? Okay, Half Dome. We all know I'm not gonna get this part but before I go, I have to ask you one question. I swear, Miss Bundy, we would keep it just as cold in here if you were a man. And wearing a bra. No, not that. I was just wondering, when did television get so weird? I mean, nobody eats breakfast at the table anymore. And cereal...? I mean, come on when I was growing up we were lucky if we got toaster leavings. "Toaster leavings"? No, "leavings." The Q is silent. They're the crumbs that you find at the bottom of a toaster. We were practically raised on them. "Toaster leavings..." I like it. Write that down. Come on, Ron. I'm a pro. I'm not taking notes from some kid. Would you rather go back to Full House? "Toaster leavings," you say? Tell us some more about your family life, Miss Bundy. Okay. Well, first there's my father. Now, you know how you have the dad and he's all happy and glad to be home? Well, in my family, it's not really the case. Well, then of course, there's me. And that's what it's like to be a part of my family. Well, thank you, Miss Bundy. That was enlightening. So you mean I get to be on Pease in a Pod? No, but I am casting for the lead in The Mother Teresa Story. Would you mind disrobing and saying, "Oh, the children"? Good evening, family. And welcome to the second first annual Bundy-financial-crisis summit meeting. Hey, guys. Hey, Daddy guess what today is. The pathetic continuation of yesterday? No. It's the premiere of Pease in a Pod on Fox. Hey, let's turn it on. I gotta see that bimbo they got to play my part. Fox network viewing positions. Peg hit the button. Tak e a mom and a dad And two kids and a dog Put them all in a house With a mouse You've got Pease in a pod Pease, Pease, Pease Pease in a pod Well, this certainly looks like another winner. Wow, that room looks familiar. You know those sitcoms, they all look alike. Will you look at that God-awful couch. Hey, that's funny. In the scene that I read, it started with everybody eating breakfast. Boy, does my life suck. Thank God, I got the house to myself. Hey, Chuck. And they call me stupid. I just hope Patty left some dinner for me. What's this? Dear, Mel. I'm at the neighbours'. Dinner's at the grocery store. Wait a minute, I don't remember this. Hey, you know something, Peg? This show is pretty good. Stupid wife. Now what am I supposed to eat, toaster leavings? Boy, does my life suck. Al don't you notice something familiar about that Mel character? Yeah, both of our lives suck. Well, I guess it could be a coincidence. Hi, Mel, I'm home. Look what I got from the Shop at Home network. A whole week's worth of bonbons. Where are we supposed to put them? Well, I'm supposed to k eep them cool. How about your side of the bed? Hey! His side of the bed! Well? Well, I told them about my family. I didn't think they were gonna steal it! And what, pray tell, did you tell them about me? Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. - Hi, Ben. - Hi, Naomi. Can she and I go to the movies tonight? Son, don't you think it's time you got a real girlfriend? Dad, I do have a real girlfriend. It's just that this one puts out. It's a doll, Peg! How pathetic! - Are you guys watching this new show? - This is the greatest. It's like watching a family of chimps that can talk. No, it's not. It's us. Kelly went down to try out for the show she told the writers about us and got plagiarized. I did not! They just took my idea. Well, even so I'd say it's time we start looking nice. I'm gonna go get a drink. - What's-- - don't ask. - Hi,boys. - Hey,mom. - Happy anniversary. - Thank you. - Sweetheart,hi. - Hi,mom. Um,boys,I would like you to meet my friend elton. - Elton? - Uh,it's a family name. - A lot of people named elton. - No,I didn't mean it like-- sorry. - I'm--I'm tommy. - Hi.Congratulations. - I hear it's your anniversary. - Thank you. Tommy runs the family business. He's the one that put the winery in, and he has the most beautiful little daughter--elizabeth-- my granddaughter. And this is my son justin. Well,that about sums it up. Pick a card. - That's the one you want? - Yes. - You're sure? - yes. - Positive? - Positive. Okay. Was that your card? - no way. - How'd you do that? That's great. - Thank you. - He's great,julia. I know. Sarah found him. - I have no idea how. - You know,I have my sources. Okay,miss clara the fortune-teller... Knew everything about . She knew my first pet's name started with a "w"--wendell. It was this miniature bijon my parents used to have-- she knew that I had trouble making decisions, which is not gonna affect us and our business,um... - Hi,I'm kyle. - I'm julia.Hi. Hi,holly. Holly,nice to meet you. Uh,sarah's new business partner. - Yeah,I'm consulting for¡a - consulting? You're,like,one of the founders.So is he. We're,uh,we're starting an internet company. Oh,I-I didn't realize that you were in business with a magician. Give it a break,holly. Sarah,so who's your mom new guy? - Mom has a guy? - You don't know? She brought a guy. Excuse me. Thank you.So,uh,how do you two know each other? - it's funny. - No,it is. - It's-- it's really a funny story. - It's very--it's very funny. - Hey,guys. - hey. Isn't this great? I feel like a kid again. This is my beautiful daughter sarah. - Elton. - Hi. Oh,elton. Mom was just gonna tell us how they met. Oh,god. I love the "how we met" stories.Go on. We were at a restaurant a--not together. We weren't together,were we? And this man began to choke. and elton-- he just went over there and gave him the heimlich maneuver,just like that. Nora called the paramedics. And then we started talking,and we have just so much in common. - hilarious. - Wow,M. Some guy almost dies,and you go score a date.Good girl. It's not a date,per se. Yeah,and don't worry. He w--he was fine... Once he spit out the,uh,the- the fish bone. - Ham gristle. - ham gristle? - Was it a fish bone? - It was a fish bone. - Yeah. oh,it was a fish bone. I didn't even know what it was. Okay,so why don't you kids go have some fun? We're going to go d enjoy the magic and all that. - Nice meeting you. - You,too,elton. What was that? I guess,uh,mom has a new boyfriend? Elton? Really? ah. I see it. Look toward the bottom of the cup. See how the leaves form the shape of a heart? Sorta,if I squint. - What does that mean? - It means the's a great love in store. Someone is out there waiting for you. Yeah,that would be my boyfriend. He's out there waiting for me to say "I love you." Actually,the placement indicates the distant future. It could take years to meet this person. Years? What about now? Um,what are you saying,that justin's love isn't great? I can only interpret what's here. You don't even know him. I mean,you're just reading some--some leftover dregs from a stupid teacup. It's not stupid,unless your spirit is closed. My spirit is not closed. I mean,who said that my spirit is closed? Your spirit is closed. Look,I know you think you're in love,but I promise, another few years,a great love will come along... you're not even going to remember this guy. Oh,that's wonderful,ethan. great. Oh,kevin,you're here. You just missed some fantastic magic. Not a fan,remember? I actually need your advice,okay? You worked for your brother-in-law. What did you do when dad did things you didn't like? I don't know what you're talking about. Okay,you--you didn't tell mom about holly for one thing. Well,I didn't tell your mother about holly because I thought I was protecting her. My job is to protect robert,and I'm not saying he's dad,but he's a-- he's asking me to cover for him without telling me what it is I'm covering. All he says is I- - I have to trust him. Do you? I don't know. We all know you're the family cynic. I mean,certainly,that's why you hate magic. You just are always looking for the angle. You can't give in to the illusion. But robert is not an illusion. That's what you're gonna have to decide for yourself-- if he's putting one over on you or if robert is the real thing. And by the way,kevin,if you can't trust him,don't work for him. make it here,you know? Excuse me. Sorry. - Hey. - Can I talk to you? Hey,where you been? I've been looking all over for you. I love you. You do? Yeah. God,that felt good. Wow. Yeah. - Damn right,that feels good. - yeah,I know. I feel like there's weight off my shoulders. That woman had no idea what she was talking about. What woman? Um,nothing. Just this fortune-teller. She said that you're not my great love. Whatever. Wait,that--that's why you said it,because some fortuneeller told youe were doomed? So this is your moment? Rebecca,this seems like a lame protest to me. Justin,why are you making such a big deal out of this? Well,I'm--I'm sorry.Where I come from, saying I love you actually comes from the people saying it. Okay,well,sorry.I-I can't seem to say anything right. Why don't you just write me a script next time? You know what? I'm gonna give you these back,rebecca. And when you figure it out,you let me know,all right? So... elton? Yes,elton.Why are you guys so hung up on his name? Have you guys done the dance with no pants? - Sarah. - What? Come on. One of us should be having sex,and sadly,it's not me. Well,it's not me,either. Just because I brought a friend to the party does not mean we're sleeping together. I mean,you brought two men with you. I'm not accusing you of having a menage trois. Mom! Well,you're the one who brought up sex. Well,I regret it, almost as much as I regret bringing ethan and kyle. Holly practically did a cartwheel when she heard we were in business together. Holly doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. I don't know,mom. Maybe she's right. I mean,really,a start-up in this financial climate? Bear stearns can't even keep afloat, and I'm in business with a magician who wants to show me his rocket ship. - Oh,no. - You think I made a mistake. - Oh,my god. - Oh,god.It's bad. I really screwed up. Oh,hi. Kitty,what are you doing here? I-I thought you were meeting with your birth mother. Yeah. Well,I--it-- uh,it's a long story. Well,good. Tell sarah about it. what the hell is up with mom? I don't know. She's been acting weird all night. She brought this guy-- elton. - Elton? - Exactly. Dude,what's with the briefcase? Robert won't give you the night off? Kevin has a new job. Yeah,he's a lawyer turned republican. I'm still a democrat,dumb-ass. Why don't you be nice,justin? You' embarrass your mother's date. - Oh,it's not really a da. - Elton,there you are. You know,it's such a lovely evening out. Why don't we take a walk? That sounds like a date to me. I was really enjoying talking to your family. Oh! Kitty. George? What-- what are you doing here? This is elton. That's mom's date. Don't be rude. Do you want a drink? Oh. You're-- you're dating ryan's dad? - No,she's dating elton richards. - I'm not dating him. What? I'm--I'm sorry. Excuse me.No,no,no. - This is,uh,george lafferty. - what? Ryan's george lafferty? - mom. - Mom,I knew you were hiding something. Mom! All right,fine. George,this is my family. Family,this is... george lafferty. Hi. Oh,my god. unbelievable. Since when are you friends with george lafferty? - He kicked us out of his house. - You went to his house? - Look,this is really all my fault. - No,it is not. I invited you here to meet ryan's half siblings. I'm soy we deceived u,but george needs to figure this out. I thought meeting you might help. So what is this,like,a big audition to see if we're up to sibling snuff,mom? What's going on? Is everything okay? - Oh,hey,julia. - Yes,fine. - It's a lovely party. - I thought I heard yelling. oh,in our family? No. We're just all catching up with george. You mean elton. How about some cupcakes? can you believe our mom? Nothing our mom does shocks me anymore. W-why are you so out of breath? - I've been looking for you. - Well,where's scotty? He couldn't get any time off work. Where's--where's robert? Robert's at home being furious. Really? How furious? I went to see our birth mother. Oh,of course. Oh,good.Good,good,good. Oh,no. No,no.No,kevin. Not good. Bad. Very bad. N-- she changed her mind about the adoption. She's not gonna go through with it,not with us anyway. Well,did she hear something about robert? No. No,she--she loved robert. It was--it was me. I showed up with all of these questions because I wanted proof that she wasn't gonna change her mind. Well,what's wrong with wanting proof? Well,what's wrong with it is that she couldn't give it to me,obviously. And she shoun't have to. But it h--it has nothing to do with robert? Oh,would you please stop trying to make this about robert? - This is about me. - Right. Kevin,I'm serious. I think I made a very big mistake.I-I... I couldn't trust her,and... and now we don't have a baby. So fix it. looks like someone is on the horizon... someone who will bring great upheaval into your life. No,no,no.I thought so,too. But that's wrong. - No,this reading's pretty clear. - Well,the reading is wrong. George is actually a very nice guy just caught in a really difficult situation. I can identify with that. Well,the way these cards are spread,this person represents a threat. Maybe it's talking about his son ryan. And I'm telling you right now,I am done being scared. Siblings should meet each other. I think we're finally gonna get the chance to meet him, and I'm actually happy about that. - That's good. - Yeah. That's great. What else do they say? Ladies and gentlemen,I know many of you don't believe in magic. Instead,you search for an explanation. There must be something I'm not telling you,something I'm hiding. You're right. Most of the time,magic is about sleight of hand,the principle of misdirection. I make you look one way... so you forget to look the other. hi. Have you seen a young woman,light brown hair,tall? I seem to have lost my daughter. No,but I'll--I'll keep an eye out. - Uh...okay. - What--what's her ne? Rebecc thanks. Uh,wait,are...are you,uh,are you holly? Yeah. I'm,uh,I'm george lafferty. Oh,my god. You're ryan's dad. I guess you've heard about me,too. I hope you don't mind,but nora told me about what happened with your daughter. No,I don't mind. It's just thatuh,she might not be the most reliable narrator. Well,it's probably pretty complicated between you two. No,actually,it's quite simple. But I do know what it's like to be in your position, so if there's ever anything that I can do... uh,holly. I do have a few questions. Sure. watch closely,because with julia's help, you're about to see something so amazing,so improbable, it's hard to chalk it up to any fact or principle. Man has always dreamed of conquering gravity. In the 1800s,european audiences saw,for the first time,people rise unassisted... so...you called me down here. What do you got? There's an exit out that way. just maybe it's magic. With one snap of my fingers,the lovely julia will fall into a deep,deep sleep. - nora. - Oh,george.Sorry. I-I got sucked into watching the show. It's okay. I-I have to go. Go? What do you mean? You know,your family's lovely and very seductive-- seductive? All right,which one of 'em hit on you? It's--it's not like that. I was right the first time. This was a mistake. It--it won't be good for ryan orny of us. I--I'd rather leave it alone. I don't understand. Our families are what they are. Let's not destroy anything. Good-bye,nora. - Hi. - Hey. How was the party? Oh,god. Never a-- never a dull moment. I'll tell you all about that later. Robert... I am really,really sorry. I never should've gone to trish without telling you. I don't know why,but I just l my anxiety get the best of me. And I-I-I knew how you felt about her, and I didn't want you to think that I was crazy and-- I-I love you when you're crazy. But what I don't love is when you go off, you know,without me and don't tell me about it.You know, we're gonna be parents,so we need to be... - trusting each other. - I do trust you. It's just-- it's everybody else in the world that I don't trust. And I just didn't know if I could do it again. I mean,we've already lost a baby,and I-- oh,is that what this is all about? Oh,it's--it's everything,you know? It's--it's all the fertility treatments that didn't work and all the pregnancy tests that came back negative. And I just- - I have had my heart broken... many times. But I am ready to be a parent. - I know. - And I'm gonna fix it. I'm gonna make this right with trish. I prise.I'M... I'm gonna fix it. - there she is. - Good morning. - Coffee. - Thank you. - What time is it? - It's on time. You laid down the law,remember? Have you guys been to bed? Are you kidding? I worked a night at the magic manor. That's like playing carnegie hall. Check this out? See that? New web application-- simplified,streamlined,sexy. And a new carbon footprint graph. You did this last night? We may act like we're stupid. We're not. You don't act stupid. You act 20. - We're older than that. - I know.Sorry. Listen,working with you guys,it's a little bit of an adjustment. I have a lot at stake. Yeah? Well,so do we. You know,you shouldee our credit card bills. We're not gonna fail. Miss clara last night told me we're gonna make boatloads of money. you just gotta trust the process. Maybe you're right. Ethan,draw me a rocket ship. Yes,ma'am. you seen the paper today? No,I-I was just-- "senator robert mccallister had a private meeting " with fellow republican governor eve kern "urging her to release a strong statement " against the limited marriage act in time for the general election." Any word of an affair? Nope,just a follow-up from the governor refirming all californians' rights to marry. Stu said make it go away. I... made it go away. While forwarding your own political agenda. You know,I'm gonna take about five minutes before I fire you. Look,I was just-- this is grounds for immediate termination. Kevin,when you're in a foxhole with someone, you need to know the man who's got your back, and right now,I don't know who you are. I had to deal with that reporter on the fly. That statement I had for proposition 8 was in my briefcase. It was at my disposal. I used it. Do I still think you should've released it of your own accord? Absolutely. But I was not out to undermine you. If you had trusted me with the actual information, I wouldn't have had to resort to this. Okay. The governor's having an affair. And it's messy,and there are children involved, and she wanted to meet with me to get my advice. And I told her she's gotta come clean,but I don't know where this is gonna end. Kevin,you have my trust, but there are gonna be times when I'm not gonna be able to tell you everything. Fair enough. Here. Wait. This isn't spencer's article. No,no. That's an op-ed piece by henry myers. That guy's been pissing on me since the day I got elected. Now all of a sudden,I'm a hero. Good job. Thank you,senator. Seductive? Our family is seductive? No. This came right from holly. Oh,you don't know that,nora. Maybe george decided on his own. No,no,no,she had it written all over her face. This woman lives to get at me. First she pushes me to find george and tell him the truth. And then the minute he starts connecting with our family, she sends him running for the hills. Well,isn't that what you wanted? Poof,remember? Holly doesn't have anything on you now. It's all over. Yeah. I can't help feeling there's something looming on the horizon. Oh,it's a bit overdramatic,wouldn't you say? Even the fortune-teller said that. Now who's buying into magic? She said someone would come into our lives that would cause great upheaval. And she said that I would meet a nice woman and I would settle down. All right. You're right. What am I worried about? This is exactly what I wanted,and it's the best thing. It's the very,very best thing. It's the best thing. Just tell her to hold on one second 'cause I'm here. I'm right outside. I was--oh! Trish. Kitty,you can't keep showing up. I know.You're on your way to the airport,but I-I owe you an apology. I... I just got scared because you remind me so much of me, and I know how much I nt this baby. And I know that that's--that's me. That--that's not you. But I... I promise. I promise. There--there will be no more second guessing. I'm--I'm just gonna take the leap. I--I'm gonna be like one of your patients. My life is in your hands. And not that you can't change your mind,because of course you have every right to. It's just that I don't wt to change it for you. So I'm just gonna- - I'm gonna hang back and--and wait,and,uh... and trust you. Well... thank you. But I already called my social worker. She's sending me a new batch of files. Oh,no,no,no. Please,please. Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait. Don't do that. Don't do that.Robert and I are the same people that you picked. And--and we-- kitty,there are plenty of babies out there,and you will be great mom to one of them. But this shouldn't be so complicated. - Life is complicated enough. - No,you're right. You're right. I-I-I agree.I agree. It shouldn't be so complicated. You know what? It won'T. I'm sorry. I-I really have to go. Good luck. Justin Come in wow. Hi. Is this,uh,always how you make up? No. No.Um... I've just been thinking. You know that milestone we approached badly, the one we pretty much just smashed right into? Yes,I,uh,I remember. Yeah. Um... I was scared. I've never said that to anyone before. It always just kind of made things seem so final, and nothing ever felt final to me... except this. I know that I said that I wanted to wait for the right moment, but there is no... right moment, because it's every moment. I love you. can I say it back? You better. I love you,too. Yogonna kiss me? Well... Brothers and Sisters Season 3 Episode 07 Anyway, this is... this is me. - Thanks for walking me home. - It's my pleasure. You wouldn't want to come up for some coffee, would you? A little late for coffee. Yeah. I'd love a beer. Ok. Yeah, I know. It's a little weird, Isn't it? No, no. It, it shows your passion for your work. Actually, all of this is for my roommate. It just... I don't know, it makes him feel so at home. - Where's home? - Borneo. You're gonna love him. You're gonna love him. Chango! Chango. You want to give him a peanut? - I don't. - Here you go. Come on. Just... - hey, he took it! - Yeah! - He really likes you. - We have a lot in common. We're both evolving, we both have a little bit of a back hair issue. Both have the Same taste in women. Yes, question? - Can I show you something? - Sure. Sure. Show away. I shot this during my last rescue. See, in... in the world of primates, the female always... initiates. This was bad idea, wasn't it? No, no, no, no. That's just a very powerful image, very intense. Yeah. - It is, isn't it? - Yeah. I mean, their mating rituals are so raw and so beautiful. I'll give you the raw. Would you like to do that? I'm sorry... do what? That. With me. You... want that? Yeah. I could maybe give you half that. Come on, Gator. Take me like a silverback. Come on. This is new.

English. Basically, Gator, your ass was pummeled, ok? But don't worry. I think all you need is 3 stitches, and definitely a shave, for sure. What the hell is going on here? Gator had a little run in with a bi-Curious George. - Got attacked by a Monk. Ey! - Sorry. That clears things up. Look, I'm on my way to the office. Is there the slightest chance That you've signed your divorce papers? He's still wearing his ring. What do you think? How many times do I have to tell you guys? I can't get the damn thing off. - you try. - Do not pull that finger. Gator, I'm getting a lot of pressure from the other side. Look, I just. I want to go over the papers a couple more times, ok?

He's got great posture. Really clean fingernails. He's, honorable. - What's a matter with this guy? - He's short. He's really short. He can't help that. I know, but I've just never dated a guy shorter than me before. I mean, chad was 6'6", and I kind of like... You know what? Not to be insensitive and please don't take this the wrong way, but chad was a douche. - The biggest douche. - Captain douche. Guy played you for 7 years, never pulled the trigger. All we're saying, kate, is don't compare everybody to the Chad. - Open your mind. - I know. I know, you're right. Tim is great, and I'm going to give it a shot.

It's not every day I get to have dinner with a doctor. There's nothing more attractive then a man who's so passionate about what he does. But I'm sure you're just as passionate about being a who... who... Pros... prosti... - An escort? - An escort, yes... It's ok. You can say it. I'm not ashamed. No. I'd never suggested you should be. It's just, you know... Look, I know how hard it is out there. I mean, as pathetic as it sounds, I just try and look at this as getting paid to try and find Mr. Right. Wow, that's... very healthy perspective on the whole thing. I mean... happy, happy birthday we have something for you happy, happy birthday we have something for you Did you do this? I did it!

It's so romantic! - But, still, I don't know. - Ok. You know what? Oh, it's fine. - You're disappointed. - No, no. It's a silly idea. - It's not a silly idea. It is. No. We can do your thing. - But I don't want to do... - The, the cheesecake thing. - Yeah, we'll have fun. - It's a good... Do you know what? It's my birthday.

And apparently she's flammable. I need to ask you a huge favor. She's all wound up. I can't handle her right now. - Will you take her home for me? - Why can't you take her home? Because have to work with these people. I don't want this any more awkward than it already is. I don't know, man. I've got a real sweet tooth for this Jennifer Spanishton sitting over here by the chocolate volcano. Hey, please do this for me. Please do this! You can take the limo. I'll cab it. Ok. I'll do it. Only because it's you. Ok. Thank you. Hey, be discreet. Don't worry. When have I ever not been discreet? Now! Live in the now. Live in the now. Gotta live... good party, isn't it? Llllllucky the Leprechaunnnn! Yeah! That one's for you. Are you ok? We'll take 2. We're gonna take 2 of these. Do you believe in fairy tales? I do now. What about ufos? Do you believe in those? I haven't really thought about it. Do you believe in low carbohydrate diets? No. I like pasta. I do, too. Hey. - Hey. - What are you doing here? I was just checking the scores. Why didn't you check them at your own place? 'Cause I just tucked Kitty into your bed. But... Why'd you bring her here? What do you mean? You told me to bring her home for you. Her home, not my home! No, no, no, no, no, no! You said, and I quote, "please take her home for me, and be discreet." - Which is exactly what I've done. - Please tell me you're joking. Ok, I'm joking. God... But I'm not. She's in your bed. But I totally teed her up for you, man. I sprayed some air freshener in there, lit some candles. I told her how hot you thought she was, and then if she slept with you, it wouldn't be the worst thing for her career. Are you kidding? That's sexual harassment. - Even on the weekend? - Are you kidding? Anyway, it's fine. I calmed her down. She was mad? For like a second. But I told her that you're normally not this pushy, but that, you know, you're a little desperate because of the divorce. Gator! - I gotta go. - No, Tommy! No, you have to take her home! By the way, I put your hamper by the bed in case she throws up again. Gator, come to bed! - Oh my god! - You're in luck. This morning, kitty waxed her whiskers. Annie, Annie. Listen to me. Annie, look, last night may just have been like the best night - of my entire life. - Mine, too! No, but, listen, I want to have last night every night with you. I know this seems crazy, and it is crazy you know, but my friends, you know they always tell me that I need to take more chances, and I never do. So without further undo, Annie Lewis Bappy, Would you... What's wrong with this picture? She should be on her knees! Sir, I'm kind of in the middle of something... Hey, hey, Atlantic City, Taj Mahal. You're my kind of guy. Chuck, we had the best time! Hi, Pookie. Chuck? Who's this Chuck? Annie's full-time manager, Part-time boyfriend. You said boyfriend? What do you say we just go ahead and settle up here, birthday boy? No, no, I already settled up. I paid in advance. For dinner, so all you're responsible for is the additional balance. Additional balance? What does he mean, additional balance? Here's the breakdown. You had her for 10 hours at the regular rate, the last 4 at time and a half, plus, you took her across state lines, which may or not be a violation of the mann act. - This wasn't in the website... - That's an additional surcharge. And then, of course, uncle Sammy's gotta get his. Yes, I agree with that. - Tell you what I'm going to do. - Ok. - You know, you look like good people. - I try. I think, I'm gonna round it down to an even 8 grand. It, $8,000? Yeah. Nikki, hi. Is this an ok time? Yeah. Yeah, come on in. I'm sorry I haven't signed the papers. I'll get to it this week. Actually, I'm glad you haven't signed them. Really? Yeah, look, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, and I know I really messed up. Look, it's over. It's been over for a while. And what about guy? Guy. He's back at Cirque du Soleil. I don't know. I was just hoping there's maybe some chance that we could... It's Dr. Freddy. I got raped by a monkey the other day. I should probably take this. Freddy, can I call you... What? Hooker? What... what... Chuck? Who's Chuck? Freddy, slow down. Slow... all right, take it easy. I'll be right there, ok? Look, Nikki, I'm sorry, I gotta go. - You've given me a lot to think about. - Well, what's to think about? I already told you, guy's gone, he left. Guy left. Well... Thank you. - Look, I'm a doctor. I'm... - Freddy, Freddy, Freddy, calm down. Calm down, ok? It's gonna be ok. All right, 8 grand. Come on, I got systems. Cash only. Come on, man! What kind of business are you running? He said that she didn't in about. - Hey! I tried, all right? 37-year-old virgin here wanted to wait. - I thought she was different. - She is different. She's a hooker. Where am I supposed to get 8 grand cash on a sunday, Mr. I got systems? Hold on, wait, wait. What? - Freddy, you didn't. - I paid 11,000 for it. Take it. 11,000? Be lucky to get 7 gs out of this. What else you got? You don't have to do that, Gator. All right, it's a deal. I'll pawn 'em both. You're gonna pawn 'em? What about us? Baby... You're right. You've been my top bitch for 12 years.

You are the first male in the baring last night. - Transcript By : yyets.net Previously on Psych... I needed to talk to you. Just say it, say what it is. I don't want to feel guilty about moving on with my life. Your mother's not a part of it anymore. Look. I don't care what you do, okay? I don't care. Mom? Dispatch, we've located the stolen vehicle. Occupants inside. Approaching now. 10-4, proceed with caution. Henry, you don't wanna do this. I don't have a choice, Ray. Think of the consequences. I'm way past consequences. This needs to end tonight. Whoops. Whoops? It's my neighbor's car. We were gonna put it back. It was just a dare. Is there a problem here, Officer? You wanted my attention, Shawn, you got it, buddy. Wait. You guys know each other? Yeah. He's sort of my dad. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask for that "World's Greatest Dad" mug back. You just keep talking, Shawn. You keep talking. Oh, don't worry, I will. Like when I read you your rights. Oh, I have rights? That'll be new and fun. What am I gonna tell your mother? I don't know, you think you can get a hold of her new phone number? I hope it was worth it, smart-ass. This officially ends your chance of being a cop. Let's be honest, I gave up wanting to be like you a long time ago. That's it! Somebody book him. You, beanpole! Get over here. Fingerprint him, now. Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. Me? Never mind, rookie, I'll do it myself. Burton Guster. Dude. I'm freaking out. You have to help me. What's wrong? My mom is here. She's back in the country? Back in the country? Try, try back in the city. Try downstairs in my dad's kitchen. Where are you? Hiding out in my bedroom. Oh, my God! Holy crap. I just found an entire unopened box of Shrinky Dinks. You're hiding in your bedroom because your mom came to visit? Dude, you've got problems. Are you hearing what I'm saying? My mom is standing downstairs, in my dad's kitchen, laughing it up, having a grand old time. You don't think that's a little weird? And you're unhappy she's here? No, I'm not unhappy she's here... I don't know. I haven't seen her in three years. She used to tell me everything. What's she doing here? Working. For the police department? I guess, I don't know. I haven't found out much because, apparently, it's 1988 in my house and no one felt the need to tell me anything. I know my dad is behind all of this... Oh, my God! Furby! Dude, did you know I had a Furby? Shawn, I have no time for this. I've got my own problems. I have to go see Frankjim Ogletree. Frankjim Ogletree? Is that a person or a hippopotamus? He's the new Regional Sales Manager. My immediate boss. And a tyrant. They call him the little Pinochet. That's too abstract. Why don't they just call him "jerk pants"? Or "Suck McJones"? They're MIT guys, Shawn. Now, go face your parents. You've been wanting to see your mom for ever. And tell her I'm coming by for some Jell-O cake. Holy... Dude! I just found a pristine issue of Dynamite magazine with Square Pegs on the cover. Hold on, I'm gonna read "Bummers" to you. The cheese knife is in the same place, right? Yeah, it's right there. You want me to give you a hand, hon? Did you just call me "honey"? I did not. I was going to say "hunchback. " Oh, Shawnie, look at this. Not only does your father own a very expensive bottle of Bordeaux, he hand-made little cucumber sandwiches. Do you believe that? Wow, he is just chock full of surprises today. Well, I'm allowed to expand my horizons, right? I am so glad to see you, Mom. What are you doing in town? Well, some police departments occasionally call me up to come back and do psych evaluations. How long have you known about this? Not long. I almost didn't do it. I changed my mind at the last second. I'm doing Santa Barbara PD, a few in San Diego, the Bay area. When are our dinner reservations, Henry? Oh, there's dinner plans tonight? You can make it, right? Of course he can make it. Of course I will come, I just... Need to cancel a date but that is not a big deal. You made other plans? I didn't make other plans. I didn't know. Didn't know what? That you were coming. Henry, why didn't you tell him I was coming? He doesn't have a phone. You don't have a phone? What... I do. Are you having money problems? Henry, why don't you buy him a phone? Mom, I'm fine. I'm not having money problems. I dropped my phone while I was solving a very important crime. I was on the front page of the newspaper yesterday. Yeah. May I speak with you privately? What the hell is going on in there? I tried to tell you, Shawn. Allow me to demonstrate trying. "Shawn, guess who's coming back into the country on Friday? "Your mother. " That's it. Mission accomplished. All right! Look, I wanted to clear the air on a few things before she got here. Clear the air? You think you can undo 15 years of hard feelings with a bottle of... Pinot... Bordeaux. I didn't even know Walmart had a wine cellar. Look, would give me a break? I'm just trying to make a nice night here for her here. You're sabotaging me. Why would I do that? I don't know, but I'm gonna figure it out. You wanted to see me, Mr. Ogletree? Shut the door, Burton. I was reading the paper yesterday and something caught my attention. Have to say I was surprised, considering you seem to already have a full-time job. This is just something I do on the side. A hobby, really. Like collecting thimbles or raising carrier pigeons. You raise carrier pigeons? No. Not at all. That's totally lame. I just said that because I was flustered. I raise carrier pigeons. I'm glad you said that, because I was afraid to tell you how cool I thought carrier pigeons are. Flying around and carrying stuff. Coming back. Awesome, I hear that. Are you familiar with the exclusivity clause in your contract? It means we don't allow second jobs. Jobs? No, no. Psych is more like community service. And it never affects my work. This photo was taken Thursday night, I noticed you signed out early that day. I think the important thing is I signed out. Let's roll back the clock, shall we? Monday, the 28th, you had three appointments. You missed all of them. Tuesday, the 29th, you disappeared after lunch. And Wednesday, well, here you are. You did your entire week's work in one afternoon. It was a crazy week. It seems to me you had a crazy year. I have taken the liberty of preparing this for you. What is this? It's a termination notice. Or, you could quit your other job. You tell me. Good choice. I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Shawn, you don't have to walk me through the whole building. I used to do quite a few sessions here. This is where I met your father. I know. I heard the story. You did his evaluation after he shot some drug dealer. He told you that? He twisted his ankle doing security for the Cinnamon Festival. I had to clear him for duty. Figures, that's about par. What happened? He said the two of you are getting along better. Mom, the last thing I wanna do right now is talk about Henry. Okay, that's fair. Let's talk about you. Who was that date you had to cancel on Friday? Ah, it was just some girl I met. She was a museum curator. It's not a big deal, Mom. I doubt it would've worked out anyway. How many dates? That would've been the first. Shawn. Mom. Come on, Goose, whenever we talk, you're always about to not go on a second date with somebody new. I happen to be excellent at first dates. You know who is having multiple dates? Dad. I believe he's up to number eight with his Jekyll and Hyde English girlfriend. You guys should connect more often. He told me they broke it off a few weeks ago. We're talking about him again. Yes, we are. Let's stop. I should let you go. How many of these do you have to do, anyway? Oh, three uniforms and a detective. Oh. You wanted to see me, Chief? Yes. It has come to my attention, Detective, that you've discharged your weapons in the last four cases you've worked. Thank you. That wasn't a compliment. I'm just trying to keep the streets safe, Chief. The last incident was at a cat show. Well, let me just go on record as saying that I would never shoot a cat. I guess I could find some solace in that. Unless it was approaching in a threatening manner or refused to stop upon my command. I would probably just fire a warning shot to make my point but it's really a field decision. I can't commit to it at this juncture. I've requested a department-sanctioned psychologist to come here and have a session or two with you. I'm just gonna have to say no. That wasn't a question. Could you phrase it like one? Hey, Katie. Kathy. Shawn. Shawn? What the hell are you doing here? I should ask you the same question. I work here. Okay. I should ask you a different question. Why didn't you return my calls all weekend? Shawn, I had no other choice about all this. Oh, my God. This isn't a joke! You're really quitting Psych? I'm so sorry, Shawn. In a text message, no less? I couldn't think of any other way to tell you. I knew you would just try to convince me to stay. Listen, maybe we can still do it on the weekends. If you're ready to hear some good news, I have worked out a compromise that will solve all of this. Really? Yes. You quit this job. This job, you quit! We take on extra cases to make up the difference in salary. I make 48 grand a year, Shawn. What is that? Yen? Who needs $48,000 to live? I need 32. The other 16 generally goes to you. Don't be ridiculous. I claimed you on my taxes, Shawn. Holy crap, is this Bianca's pappardelle? Mmm-hmm, I found it in the kitchen fridge. Oh, my God, she's going to go insane. She hand-rolls the pasta every weekend, Shawn. They take all day. She grinds her own spices, Shawn! Well, I thought it was for everybody. Crap. Burton? Bianca. Paul would like to see you. Mr. Haversham? Really? Lovely. I'll be there in a second. What does she do? She's Haversham's secretary. Is Haversham the guy who tried to fire you? No. He's that guy's boss. Everybody's boss. He's the VP. Perfect. He's the one we have to convince to let you keep doing both jobs. But... I need a second. I gotta clean my teeth before we go in. No. No, no, Shawn. You're leaving now. Gus, I'm not budging until we make this nice. All right, but you asked for it. Asked for what? Let go of me! Don't you dare go boneless on me, Shawn! Okay! Lower back. You see? That's why it's not... Oh! You son of a bitch! You wanted to see me? Yes, I did. I have a project for you. Have a seat. Is that your wife? My grandmother. Tell her I said she's lovely. She died. I'm going to sit down now. Lots of talk about this in the office. Yes, sir. I'm aware of that, and I've already taken care of it. I don't think you have. When my wife and I moved into our house, we were met with a series of unexplained disturbances. Perhaps fueled by my wife's predilection for the supernatural. Well, after a while it stopped. But recently, these occurrences have returned. To the point where my wife is staying with her mother. Mr. Haversham, why are you telling me this? Because I believe my wife believes our house is haunted, and I would like to hire you. Gus, I had a strange feeling I was needed. Cool, huh? Looks like word getting out about you moonlighting isn't the worst thing in the world. Let's be clear. Haversham is the most powerful man in this office. He's gonna be running this company sometime soon. Give the man the respect he deserves. What is this? His company bio. Learn it. "Bred for success"? His father is William Haversham. Genius entrepreneur. This guy grew up under the tutelage of a business master and real estate magnate. I know him. He's the one who built the Poliodome. Polodome. That's a much less depressing name. Should we go? No. Meet me at Haversham's at 7:00. I think I can handle that. And no whimpering. And no screaming. No running from anything. I don't care how spooky his old house is. Haversham thinks my nickname is Fearless Guster. Well, do you want to start some sort of recording device? No. I don't record my sessions. I prefer just to talk. How do you remember the important things? You've heard of a photographic memory? Well, I have a bit of... I guess you'd call it an eidetic tonal memory. So, you'll remember everything I've said? Pretty much. Yes. Would you like to start? Yes, first question, where's the bug? The what? The bug. Nothing new in this area. Must be concealed on your person. I honestly don't have anything on me. Then you wouldn't be opposed to me patting you down? Actually, I'm very opposed to that. Would you be willing to submit to a polygraph? Shawn, don't do this to me. You are late. At this moment, you are officially late! Just call me when you get here. Hello? Is somebody there? I just heard you squeak. Damn you, Shawn! I thought you were a ghost from outside. And yet, you still came in all by your lonesome. Fearless Guster impresses. How did you get inside the house? Hadewych, the housekeeper. She was leaving so she let me in. Tiny little dollop of a woman, Dutch-Indonesian. Enormous forearms. She made me a pannekoek. It's like a pancake but it is the size of a manhole cover! Are you wearing Haversham's robe? Yep. You should try it. The worm that spins this silk is extinct. You can't find these. Take it off. I can't. Hello? Where are your clothes? In the dryer. In the dryer? Well, the sauna was a little bit hotter than I was expecting! Mr. Haversham. We got here early. Hadewych let us in. We love her, and we'd like one of our own. Is that an ascot? Yes. Yes, it is. I like it. It's a classic accoutrement. It's nice to see someone with a sense of tradition. Gus and I are both huge fans of the classics. To be completely honest, I'm surprised he isn't wearing his spats this evening. Can we see the epicenter of the ghoulish activity? Please, don't touch anything. I'm sorry, Mr. Haversham, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to touch absolutely everything. Including this naked lady lamp. I almost might have to sniff some stuff. Possibly lick some things. These Tootsie Roll pops come to mind. Are you a skeptic, sir? Elaine's the real believer, so I guess you could say that. Just as I thought. Please leave. What? Shawn! I'm sorry, sir. You are a skeptic. Therefore, you must wait in the hall, preferably at the end. You're killing all of my jujubes. Jujubes are candies. Exactly. You better take off that robe. I will. And I know what you're trying to do. What? Innocently flip through a photo album? No. You're sabotaging this on purpose. Why would I do that? To get me fired so I have no other choice but to go back to Psych. That's actually an ingenious plan. But that's not how I play, Gus. I play fair, and I roll hard. I'm gonna find this man's ghost and I will rid him of it. Did Haversham have any enemies? Not really. Corporate thinks he's a magician. He completely revamped our inventory system. Really? Whole system from A to Z, including M? All the vowels? This guy sounds like a real maverick. Mr. Haversham, allow me to say this is my most valuable work experience yet. Well? Allow me to say that I'm not impressed. Duly noted. Magnum! Quiet, boy! Stop that! Quiet, boy! What is he barking at? I don't know, he never barks. Come on, boy. Come on, that's it. Here we go. Dude, look at you. You were cool as a cucumber while that went down. Fearless Guster is a badass. Let's check the basement. I can't. Why not? My feet won't move. So? How did it go? I'm winning. How are you winning? I answered every question in character as Tom "Gunny" Highway. Who is Tom "Gunny" Highway? Clint Eastwood's character in Heartbreak Ridge. It's not a contest, Carlton. Don't kid yourself, O'Hara, you'll only come out losing. Losing what? Why are we going to the basement? Because, Gus, that's where ghosts do their thing. It's cold, and dark, and dusty. Excuse me. Can I help you two? Yeah, we're just gonna check out the basement. We don't go to the basement. He doesn't go to the basement. Why is that? Mold spores. My wife had some workers here. You can get to the door, but you can't get in 'cause it's bolted shut. I still think it's probably worth... Is that hot chocolate? It's Dutch cocoa. Hadewych makes a pot for me each night before she leaves. I see. Mr. Haversham, in order to fully understand the connection that you have with this ghost, I will need to see what you see, wear what you wear, drink what you drink. You're saying you'd like some hot chocolate? Yes. With marshmallows, please. Right. What? It's Dutch! It tastes like it was dipped straight out of Willy Wonka's river. Would you get serious? Well, he's not the most gracious host, you know. If he'd just offered I wouldn't have had to ask. And that pannekoek? Not nearly as filling as it may have seemed. You're getting hot chocolate on the floor. Did you see that? What the hell is... Magnum! Down, boy! That dog is kind of an "A" hole. It sees something. Yeah, urine stains on my pants. So, what do we do now? I think we stay here. We close the blinds. We lock the doors. We call it a night. Del Taco? Del Taco? No, not me. I'm going out there. Are you kidding me? Shawn, this is what we do. There's a ghost out there, so would you cut the... We need to do this... Okay, fine. Do you have high-end energy efficient xenon flashlights? Pardon me for saying so, but Fearless Guster sucks. I don't care what you say, we're solving this case. So suck it up. Suck what up? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I don't know. You got my mind all messed up. I'm going that direction. She went that way. Good luck. Hey, it's me. Not letting you do this alone. Where is he? I got her! What do you mean, you got her? What is going on here? I don't know. I realized something. Yesterday, with all that talk about weapons, I neglected to ask you a very important question. What kind of gun do you carry? Would you like to see it? I would love to. Picked this up with a little extra cash after I decided not to go with a divorce attorney. You're going through a separation? Well, yeah. Yeah, it's... You know, she went with one of these high-powered ambulance chasers but that's just her insecurities, you know. You know who you remind me of? Who? Did you ever see that movie Heartbreak Ridge? Mold spores, Shawn. Well, I'm attracted to places I'm not allowed to go. Good luck with your stachybotros virus. Listen, man, we need to wrap this up quickly. I have dinner plans with my mom tonight. I've hardly had a chance to see her at all. Shawn. What? Hadewych! It's okay, I'm Shawn Spencer, it's me and my partner, Lemongrass Gogoloab. Have you noticed anything strange? Only now. We saw a woman in the woods last night that may not have been alive. Saturday, the missus, she leave. Go to mother's, yes? Sunday, I forget my bag, come back. I hear voices, lady voices in the house. What did you do? I leave. Too much strangeness here lately. Something's off with that woman, Shawn. Okay. Nothing's happening. I gotta go. What? Gus, we made plans. My dad has been manipulating her time all week. Shawn, let me be clear. I'm not leaving here until Haversham not only wants me to keep moonlighting at Psych forever, but also makes me a partner. Sorry, buddy. Wait, what's this? Are you leaving? Mr. Haversham, it is my belief that we have done all there is to do here tonight. Tomorrow, we will look into the history of the house, see if there's anything there that can help us. Just don't have any leads at this point. So, I think we should all pat each other on the backs for a job well done so far, reconvene first thing in the morning for a nice farmer's breakfast. I have dinner plans with my mother. Oh, you made it. I was sure you weren't gonna make it. I'm sorry, Ma. You've no idea the day I've just had. Well, I'm just running to the ladies'. We're right over there. We? Oh. Your father was lonely and I thought I might have to eat dinner alone, so I let him tag along. That's fine, right? You're absolutely certain he's my father? Oh! Hey, Shawn. Grab a menu. We already ordered. I'm sure it's all right. All right, what is this? What is what? This. What is all of this? The aftershave, pumiced scalp, the suit. I can wear a suit. Which one of the three tenors did you borrow that from? Not the dead one, I hope. It's my suit, Shawn. I dress up occasionally. You have a problem with that? No. I have a problem with this pretend Henry that showed up when Mom got to town. I don't know where you're going with this. You're acting
