a progressive excuse me. A progressive reduction in the rate of inward migration. And I I'd refer the panel erm to the written statement of the county structure plan of nineteen seventy nine, erm and the section entitled, the Strategic Framework, paragraph three nine on page ten. Which states erm the strategy envisag envisages a progressive reduction in the rate of the population growth from this source, as the supply of housing land is reduced to levels more closely related to the needs arising from North Yorkshire. Now the original structure plan recognized that because of the substantial number of housing commitments at that time, erm it wasn't possible erm to er bring down the levels immediately. And it was going to be a long term strategy. The term, long term strategy in fact appears in a number of instances erm throughout those pages. And I'd refer you to paragraph three ten and also paragraph four two two which I'd like to quote a short erm element from. And this states erm that Its effectiveness erm must be must be considered as a long term rather than a short term objective. The structure plan can not be seen for providing for a major or sudden change in direction. It's essentially evolutionary in its approach . So the point erm I wish to make erm on er Mr 's observations, is that it's not the strategy of the structure plan was not simply erm to seek an initial reduction erm in the rate of residential development in the county and then that roll that rate forward in progressive erm amendments to the structure plan, Hambleton District Council believes that the logical interpretation of these statements is that a progressive reduction er in house building and the rates of migration should be sought through subsequent alterations to the plan. Now we would add that representations which seek to achieve a continuation of past building rates, or a continuation of past migration levels, are not in accord with the strategy as originally approved. Finally, I'd refer you to erm the Secretary of State's decision letter of the twenty sixth of November nineteen eighty where in paragraph one he takes note of the recent justification and in paragraph six four, he states that overall, the Secretary of State broadly approves the main objective of the housing policies of the plan of reducing inward migration into the county. Yes I'd j I'd just like to to pick up on on two points er, one made by Mr , one made by Mr . Erm I think er Mr said I think that that C P R E hasn't actually offered a solution in this debate, just just raised questions. I don't think that's strictly true but I do think that the discussion we've heard so far er has fully justified erm the the raising of some fundamental questions about the the the the method of projections. Er and the point about not offering a solution, C P R E clearly has in in erm taking to to go on to talk about the subsequent parts of policy H one and H two, the County Council's figures and then doing an analysis of those in relation to the new settlement, but I appreciate chairman that erm we'll come back to that. Mr raised the point about erm the environmental appraisal of of development plans, erm as set out in P P G twelve which is is indicative of a a a new er a new framework in which plans should be prepared. And and I would argue that that er an alteration to a structure plan of this significance, should should fall within the remit of P P G twelve. My understanding of what Mr was saying was that because it's an alteration rather than a replacement structure plan, that guidance no longer applies. That's not my understanding of how government guidance works. Peter , North Yorkshire. I think Mr picked up on the points that I really wanted to address in Mr 's remarks. Other than to say, the Secretary of State didn't limit his concern to reducing rates of development. Right through the decision letters, you get two elements. The effect of excessive development on the environment in North Yorkshire, and the second on is a relationship with places like Cleveland and West Yorkshire and the need to continue to see regeneration within those areas. It was a much broader package of for the Secretary of State than I think Mr , er suggests. The other point which Mr made on the difficulties of er manipulating migration. And I think, quite cl clearly, there are difficulties in manipulating migration. What it does require are complementary policies either side er of county boundaries. Mr , er about the policies of Cleveland within their area, to retain their population by making massive allocations of land. Er adjacent er to a North Yorkshire boundary. And if you go to places like erm Guisborough, erm er and South Middlesbrough there you will see a range of housing types available for range of groups in the community. If they weren't there, those houses, I suspect a large proportion of those people would now be living in North Yorkshire. So there's a requirement of complementary policies. And the County Council's consistently said to the West Yorkshire authorities, you must make provision for a range of sites in suitable locations to help draw er development that would othe otherwise come to North Yorkshire. Now something's been said for certainly fifteen years er that I can remember. , Michael,. Several points on the the question of migration as reported or a as included by the Secretary of State in in his decision letters. The first point I'd like to make is that the original decision letter dates from excuse me, twenty sixth of November nineteen eighty. We're now thirteen years further on. I think whilst the Secretary of State has clearly said what he's said in that decision letter. I think we have to remind ourselves that that is thirteen years old and that circumstances have changed. Not least in the neighbouring metropolitan areas, where urban regeneration is thirteen years old. There's substantial improvement, particularly in West Yorkshire, and that does need to be taken into account. I'll go on to say that on the question of progressive migration restraint, I don't think anybody round this table is suggesting otherwise. The population projections that we have seen in front of us we h have discussed, are based upon what has happened in the county over the past eight years. That is that is where the migration projections have come from. The these migration flows are already constrained by s existing structure plan policies. I think the close co-relationship between the rate of building, rate of past building and structure plan requirements, shows that those policies have teeth. Th that has been what's happened, there has been a reduction in migration flow. Or or not in migration flow but in net inward migration. These population projections we have, the hundred percent projections of the H B F of fifty five point K, of North Yorkshire of forty six point two K, of of fifty four point eight. None of the requests for housing requirement are at that level. That therefore assumes a continuing an i an increasingly progressive restraint on migration. . Mr Sorry Mr . Right, er Ray , House Builders Federation. Erm Mr referred to er put great store it seemed to me on the long term effectiveness of of of reducing er building. I'd just make the simple point that a sudden twelve point five percent reduction, I referred to it this morning, er in in building, is not progressively and long term, it's a sudden change. Erm and I think that erm the C P R E have most definitely misquoted what I said. I'll repeat the point. I'm not saying that P P G twelve does not apply. But I'm making the point, it does apply but it has to be justified. You have to justify the restraints that you make. My criticism of the restraints that have been applied by the County Council, is that they have not been justified. And we would regard them as arbitrary. And I would also point out that we are not proposing excessive development, in one of the papers I've I've put round, and I repeat the point I made it earlier. We're talking about point one nine percent. Point one nine percent of the remaining unrestrained land. As an addition. And that presupposes in that calculation, if you were taking the worst case, that that would all be greenfield land. The truth of the matter is of course it probably wouldn't be all greenfield land, but that's the worst case that I'm talking about. S O I think that it would be a very special place if it was unable to absorb that amount of development. Miss . Yeah. , D O E. I merely wish to reiterate government policy, as reinforced by my Secretary of State, John Gummer, last week in the terms of the single bu regeneration budget. And the emphasis that government places on regeneration of the urban areas. Are you going to submit that document? If you wish,by all means yes . It seems to me to be important enough to be worth tabling if that can be arranged . Fine fine. Would you like would you like the press release? Yes. Please. Yeah. Mr , do you want to come back on the point made on the other side of the room about your arbitrary selection of building rates? I think presumably you'll be wishing at a later stage to look at what we're proposing in erm in individual districts. And one against another. I think the quite clearly what comes out erm of reading our papers and the papers of the district, is the er tremendous degree of consultation that's taken place on a number of occasions back and forth between district and making use of er of emerging working on er on local plans across the county. Erm to make sure that the proposals the County Council er is is putting forward are are soundly based. And we'd elaborate that when we talk about er individual districts. I think it might be worth adjourning ask if there are any more demographic . And start again . Right. I'd like to say a little bit about this table. Now? Mm. Mhm. Any more points anybody wants to make on the demographic aspects? The migration rates. environment, I don't know whether that's later Well I think we'll probably deal with that this afternoon. Yeah. Yeah. There's a Harrogate. Mr . Thank you, er David , Harrogate Borough Council. Er one or two small points I'd like to make. Mr , er a moment ago congratulated the County Council in fact on the success of the strategy in reducing migration over the last ten years or so. He then went on to say it's not actually possible to control the rate of migration and I'm sure that the the s success of of the policy in the past shows that that that is not the case. That it is possible through the appropriate use of policies, to bring down levels of immigration into the county. Er Mr also made the point that er urban regeneration erm no longer seems to have the emphasis that it did have. er I'm sure that the er representatives from the West Yorkshire authorities wi will say that their that objective is still extremely important in the in the respective U D Ps. Erm it seems to me that the emphasis has changed slightly in the representations being made by the West Yorkshire authorities and that they're now saying that it's much more difficult for them to accommodate housing developments within their own er districts. And that therefore, that growth should be exported to North Yorkshire. Er another minor point, er Mr n erm said that e the level of restraints that we're er seeking to or that the County Council is seeking to impose, represents a sudden restriction on house-building levels in in North Yorkshire. That certainly wouldn't be the case in Harrogate. Erm we would be allocating land through our local plan for the year two thousand and six. That restriction suddenly wouldn't be imposed in the next two or three years, it would be a gradual reduction through to to the year two thousand and six. And the point about erm er the extra development taking up only point one percent of the counties unrestricted land, erm is is statistical point really. It's even less taking up i i er land being taken up in the region as a whole, it's even less in terms of the U K. The important point is what it means for the settlement to the environment of North Yorkshire. And er that level of development, at five hundred hectares, is an extremely large area of land, in very sensitive locations, particularly around the main urban areas, which are restricted to a great degree. Thank you. I think we'll come back to that when we start looking at the county district by district as it were. I think Miss would like to make some comment about the table, which was presented to her. I thought you might like an for the lunch hour. Erm as the notes to this table indicate, it is a compilation by the panel secretary of what we believe is before us. You will have noticed there are some pregnant gaps on this table. We're not optimistic that we will fill them all, but one, we can for example talk about conversions. The more numerical evidence we can have before us, the better. As the chairman also said, the table points up some interesting questions. One of those interesting questions is, for example, the relationship between column H and column I and the way in which those relationships change as we move from one district to another. Thoughts for lunch time. Mr . of . Er this is clearly go going to become an important schedule and I think it you will inevitably run into difficulties here on different definitions of allocations for example. Erm if you er if I take the Greater York area for example, erm if you er if I take the Greater York area for example , the County Council erm have included in their figure of four thousand seven hundred and ten units, no new allocations, is my understanding. Right. Yes. Yeah. Yeah . This is the sort of thing we want to discuss as we go through each of the areas which we shall do under matter one C. Or one C. But I think there must be I I would suggest to you that you sh you should request a discussion between the principle parties here to agree what allocations they're taking, whether in adopted plans or proposed plans or previous plans and what windfalls. One of the great problems of this schedule would be, the definition of the amount of windfalls, bearing in mind that many of the local plans coming forward erm are about to be produced rather than have just been produced. Yeah yeah. And I think that it is an important er qualification to this schedule that the principle parties can agree what the in inputted are. Indeed and I would hope our discussion of the provision within individual districts, will amend many of these figures. Certainly those which are relate to the future as opposed to what has happened in the past. Okay thank you. Mr . Martin , North Yorkshire County Council. Just a couple of of quick comments er er chairman just on the the the vacant co blank columns you have, J K L and M. Erm whilst the County Council can provide you with some figures on vacancies at a district level, we would be very loathe to make any comment on the assumptions for conversions and windfall sites. We feel that this is very much a matter for the district councils in the preparation of their local plans, with their local knowledge which is something we do not have at the county level to be able to to make comment on . Yeah. I I I think we do accept that you probably not be able to fill those gaps. Er some districts may have some knowledge. I mean Hambleton for example having just produced their draft local plan, but other districts are not quite in that position. Yeah. But eventually those gaps would be filled. That's right. But certainly wherever it is possible to put a figure in, then we would appreciate it. Yeah, Could I also just quickly comment on the differences between columns H and I that you've referred to. That this does to a very large extent reflect the differences in local plan preparation across the county. You have already referred to Hambleton's progress . Mm. Yeah Yeah . Which is perhaps not matched with the s quite the same stage by other districts across the county. Yes. Yeah. I think that will be crystallized or become clarified as we get into the discussion, district by district. Mr , you want to come back on that. Er Richard ,. Very briefly, I think the County Council must consider what they're going to do for conversions in windfalls. It's quite clear in in P P G three, paragraph eleven, that structure plans will make clear whether the housing provision figures include allowance from expected supply from conversions and changes of use, as well as from new building. And for unidentified and for losses from demolitions. The exercise must be done and should have been done by now. Mm. Yeah, my objective was not actually to start a debate but to give you some indication of where we were going to go this afternoon. Food for thought. Mr . Leeds City Council. I'd like to come back to policy on migration chair, and I'm grateful to Mr for pointing out that nineteen eighty is thirteen years ag away and things have moved on in every respect demographically. In development terms. We've even got a new planning system. And I venture to suggest we've got new guidance from the Secretary of State. Because we in West Yorkshire have got regional planning guidance is sorry strategic planning guidance issued in nineteen eighty nine Yes. Which tells us how to determine our housing requirements and doesn't ask us to take into account restraint in North Yorkshire. But that S P G is about to be replaced by R P G isn't it? Well we would all welcome that but in in its absence, I suggest that the current policy is defined by the R P G, even though that's not specifically targeted at North Yorkshire, none the less, to be consistent, North Yorkshire should not be entitled to a to reduce arbitrarily, it's er migration assumptions. As I understand it, S P G is your S P G is not geared to the same time horizon is. D O E. Cone I just comment briefly chairman. The Strategic planning guidance goes to two thousand and one. it was based on the figures that the West Yorkshire authorities submitted to the Secretary of State, which was on a policy as I understand it, of containing as much of their population they as as they were possible to. Erm they estimated there was going to be a continued out migration, but the aim of the original West Yorkshire structure plan and the p erm strategic guidance was to contain rather more of the population. Regional planning guidance will go to two thousand and six. We shall have to see what that contains. Yeah. I think that's all we can say at this stage. Mm. Thank you. I unless anybody has got a Mr . Erm Er And Mr second. Just a just a very brief point. Erm it relates to er something that Mr said erm for er for Leeds City Council, that circumstances have moved on. I would suggest that indeed they have moved on erm since erm the original er decision letter of the structure plan. One area in fact that circumstances have moved on is erm on environmental awareness. I think that erm all would agree that now there is greater er concern than ever before about environmental issues. Erm planning legislation and advice in P P Gs erm have made the environment a far more prominent concern of planning than it was when erm the original structure plan was approved. And indeed the alterations were approved in nineteen eighty seven. Erm authorities are expected to show that environmental concerns have been comprehensively and consistently taken into adv erm account in their plans. Erm the planning conversation act nineteen ninety one requires the development plans to include policies for the conservation and that of the natural beauty and amenity of their land. Erm P P G twelve advises that policy should be in line with the concept of sustainable development. And now erm draft advice in P P G thirteen emphasizes the need to reduce the need for travel. Erm again because of the environmental con considerations. Erm and we would suggest that in the light of these new environmental erm of these new requirements and advice, erm it would be unrealistic to er to expect them not to be taken into account in the structure plan and give greater emphasis to the environmental originally environmental concerns of the structure plan. Thank you. Mr . Just to er the Leeds point, er it is actually a stated aim of the Leeds development plan to make adequate provision for the communities housing needs during the plan period, by identification of sufficient land for new dwellings, targeting of some provision for social housing, need groups and support for renewal of the existing stock. And then further in the plan, it deals with the er migration issue, and it says, New household t New household total still assumes that a substantial amount of housing will need to be met outside Leeds as a result of net outward migration from the district. Net out movement of the order of twenty seven thousand, eight hundred people is assumed over the period nineteen e eighty six, two thousand and one. Equivalent to around eleven thousand households. The loss is a little below the strategic guidance figure of thirty thousand two hundred and also represents an improvement over the historic trend. This is consistent a more optimistic view of future economic performance that is appropriate in the light of the counties economic strategy. And that and on the economic strategy which is U D P based. There's a clear implication there, that the U D P policy is moving in the dire the same direction as the Cleveland policy is moving. And that is to make provision for its own population and to claw back economic development er within the boundaries of the area. Mr that was a long quotation, can you submit It's in it's in. My submission on that point is No can you submit the doc a copy of that paper the document. Yes yes I can. It's an extract from the Leeds U D P. Yes I understood that. Our notes weren't that fast. I have I have read it elsewhere and not necessarily having read the doc the whole of the document of the Leeds U D P but on that note, since Leeds leads would you like to Yeah, could I just er respond to Mr and say, this is not the public enquiry into the Leeds development plan. Er obviously we will er justify our position at that public enquiry. Er I'm simply talking about a level playing field. What is the framework within which we are operating at the moment. And I'm again grateful to Mr for reminding the panel of the con the constraints of the environmental policies within which we all work, not just North Yorkshire authorities, we're all required to look at environmental considerations. What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. And er if if it's appropriate for North Yorkshire to apply environmental constraints within the whole of its area, I'm not talking about particular districts but in in the whole of its area, then it is appropriate for Leeds and Bradford and the metropolitan districts to to do exactly the same thing. And that will just lead to planning chaos because obviously somebody's going to fall between the plans. Thank you for R P G. On on on that note, can I suggest we adjourn for lunch, meet back here at two o'clock, prompt start. . So Mr , can you tell me whereabouts you were born in Nottingham and when? Well it so happens I was not born in Nottingham, though my early memories are of Nottingham, right even from infant school, which er started at five years of age till about seven. But in fact I was born in , Northamptonshire. My father being a railwayman and er asking and doing various jobs from being ordinary shunter and man-about, eventually graduated by way of He's he was a Lancashire man, you see? And the family really come from in Lancashire? Which is a considerably humble place. Anyway he went about in railway jobs as the years went by and I was born in , taken with the rest to Leicester, City of Leicester, but my early memories was in Nottingham. I don't remember the prior, it's what my parents have told me and the birth certificate shows, of course. And so the first memories is in the meadows of Nottingham, going to infant school about the age don't remember starting, but perhaps I'd be six years of age, and it was a little church school and they were all lady teachers and most of them Mrs and not the Miss which is nowadays er more common. And strange to say, it had coal fires in the winter, huge coal fires to keep it warm, or attempt to do, and most of the classrooms were only divided by portable partitions so that while we went from class to class as the two or three years went by,it really was in one long building and quite adequate for the time. How big were the classes then? Can you recall that? I recall being in the first class and er a teacher coming to me, as I weren't paying much attention I think, and to this day I shall remember and never forget, she just folded my arms in front of me and says, Percy, you're not listening, you'll have to have a rest. And she put my head on my hands on the desk in front of me and believe me, I went to sleep, it was must have been very, very new, compared to being at home and perhaps being laid there. But they're they were all kind ladies and er the thing that they punished us with really was made of cardboard, like er, er a pointer or a stick, it was a pointer that they pointed to the board when they drew things on and told us about them, but sometimes boys By the way, boy sat with girl, at the desk with two in and er it was quite satisfactory, I don't remember any other upset with being there th th th there were two sexes, we were five years of age to begin with and stayed till seven. Anyway, that took a year or two and I even remember taking my next brother to school, me mother saying Take Frank to school and tell Miss , he's your brother and he's five. So I did and it's very strange I remember toddling off with this little chap and er and Miss said, Who is this then? or words to that effect. And remember now, the language of the day, said It's our Frank. And er that was all the particulars I think Miss ever got for him. And that er church school took us to the standard, at that time, called standard one, which was in a big school, about half a mile away and was built by the Nottingham Education Committee and was one of say, six or eight in the Nottingham area, I suppose. And there was a far cry from the kind lady who would lay one's head on a desk and say, You have a sleep. And er In wh In what ways was was it a far cry? How how did the contrast strike you? Well although it was so near, it was really a mining district and ninety percent of the boys We were at separate schools by the way, the ground floors were boys, from the age of seven upwards, till fourteen. Upstairs were the girls, from the similar ages and and one wing of this big school was infants. Which I hadn't known about or my mother and otherwise living near enough they could have s done that school and gone through from five years to er fourteen. Anyway, standard one was a breaking-in for this er other discipline and not quite so easy and learning how to spell. And teacher would er tell us that next week with her spelling lesson she'd want a new word, would we learn one at home? And er er the week following we'd all have to spell the word we'd chose. And it was a simple as that . Again, Oh we'd graduated then from pencils and paper, to pen and ink and paper, the ink being in er a well sunk in the desk in front of us. Each boy had a inkwell and er a pen, blue-black ink and so on and some of the small books that we used for writing in were kept under the desk. Most of the textbooks, were handed to us came from cupboards of storage, of which they must have had about sixty each, those classes were always, from then on, sixty boys in a class for one teacher. Er standard one was er no trouble, except er er pretty timid, remember being timid, the boys could be very rough in play and there was much nudging in the playground as they ran about at their various games. And so to standard two, where the That was th the next year, each class was expected to take about a year, which it did. In st in standard two though, having passed through there, the Headmaster came in near the end of the second year and said because of the number of scholars er some boys would have to miss standard three because there was too many for the class. They could er er er because thi it this would be a birthrate problem not known to us as boys and I along with seven or eight others, were taken to the standard four to start, after the holidays, which was in August. We had a month's holiday in August every year. But to break us into this new er schooling the Headmaster had us in various mornings for an hour and was supposed, well tried, to make a sort of summary of what the lesson would have been in standard three . And believe it or not, one of the subjects was er the geography of England. Now, to this day, I'm a dunce at the geography of England, I know where the principle towns are, I know you go north to Manchester and south to London and generally get about. But the intricacies, I know more about Europe, eventually , and other countries, due to not being having a a briefing by a Headmaster for half an hour of something The group of us, he had eight to ten of us in the room trying to prime us on what we'd missed for a year. And and many times I apologize for asking where various places are, because I just can't visualize Most of the other things from school come without being beckoned, er one thinks of er the economy, they taught about us about various things of the economy. Oh, by this time, er being born in nineteen hundred and five, by nineteen fourteen, that was nine years, the Great War started. Yes, what what impact did that have upon your schooling ? The Great War started and took the scho er This Road school had all men teachers extep except standard one, which was an introduction from infants to grown-up and a matronly lady always called Miss , er broke us into this new sort of discipline and sternness really. The rest er er standard two to standard six, were all male, but lo and behold before I got to standard five, that had all become women and the men had all gone to the into the services. Because although that war didn't have conscription in nineteen fourteen or nineteen fifteen, I believe it started in nineteen sixteen, back end, and er we we'd got all women teachers who were quite a different problem from a school of that nature. Cos a boy in standard five could be getting on for thirteen. There were quite a few dunces,and er some didn't always get moved on and they didn't all make it into the top class, they had to stop again for another year, or period, in the class they were. Yes, I was going to ask, what well, what effect did the er er the substitution of the the male teachers by the women teachers during the the the Great War period? H How do you think it affected the schooling? Well, in my observation, as regards young boys, it er th they played could play them up, the lads would play pranks on the teacher, who would put the best on it for a long time. Worse come to the worse, she brought the Headmaster in with his cane and he was er like the one in the stories, skilled to rule, but anyway his most proficiency was wielding this cane, which was a good three foot long. It wasn't the things you go fishing with, it was a s solid cane of er not hollow, and er I never knew him have another one. But if even if one was late from for school, he had a monitor on the doors to the outside world and when the whistle went for nine o'clock that door was closed and there The boys marshalled in the yard to er get in the lines and marched to the classes. He then dealt with those who were late and those who were late would then appear to be six or seven minutes late because of these other preliminaries. But he brooked nothing, he just asked er, What's made you late? And there's various reasons, whether your mother wanted some milk bringing. By the way, this was the period when I could to a milk shop for a hape'orth of milk, but it's not the halfpenny that people think now, cos the currency's been altered quite a lot, it was very trifling, but it's true. Milk, a little dip of milk was sold, into a jug, there were no bottles, and er you could get some for a ha'penny. And so, you could be late for various things like that, but you got the stick. Oh, so whatever. And er Did it happen frequently? Children getting the stick ? It happened everyday for those who were late. Eventually, the discipline is such as one used your influence on your mother and so if I'm late I'll get the cane, and so on. So er it wasn't pleasant and I didn't have it a lot either, because I never were very big, and I never liked punishment, it made me cry every time. It did, really. It's a cruel thing and especially to hit a boy on his right hand and then expect him to write with it. This I found, at various times, my fingers were suffering from this wallop in the oh, at ten past nine in the morning. But anyway, most things were like that, I think it had to be something like, In his noisy mansion, skilled to rule. It had to be, he had to do something or they would never have er got In other ways in was a lenient school because as the years went by it was, a register was called, a teacher er opened a book and we called numbers. Alas, I found that , my surname, spelt , was always first on the register whichever class I was, so I was number one. And er,l er those whose names er began with er later initials in the alphabet and we didn't have any Z 's, there were no Zilliachas in those days. But they were some well on, lo and behold, could open the door er two or three minutes late and c er call the er number, Yes sir, er as they entered the class and they would get their mark, this being I think you got a red mark if you were late,t to stand out so that an inspector who came down periodically could look down the register and there was the record of who was early and who was late by the colour of the ink-pens, I think. So that was a strange thing too, with this er alphabetical thing. So The only Excuse me, er no, we even had Abbot, A double B, er didn't always get in front but I think it should have done you know, you take the first letter and then you take the . We had Askews and all sorts of, Astills,strange, isn't it? The alphabet? Anyway, that was a simple rhythm there and periodically a chap from the Education Committee used to come and check this register and the classes, and some passed through the class. But that was just er ordinary the geography of this, or the history of that, many battles, Bosworth Field and I was going to ask,d d do you think looking back er th th that the school erm tt taught you to regard certain things as important in life? Was it d d d w was there was there like er erm sort of pa er erm love of country or or did they stress, say the virtues of honesty a a and fairness, can can you remember anything like that? Well I I think the period that embraced my school days, you see I didn't leave till nineteen nineteen and th that meant there'd been four years of war at school and the last year well, it ended in er nineteen eighteen, the war did, so only the last year , but it was full of patriotism and all the old scholars that had er served or suffered or been killed, their names were up. Yes, we were very, very patriotic and er I'm not ashamed of it. Er I have a love of country, I know I'm er English, I don't like to say I'm British, I live and was born in England. And when I go to Wales for a holiday and there are Welshmen, they're just as good as I am, some can sing so much nicer, and I've worked with Scotsmen in engineering factories, and there's no better engineers than Scotsmen, but they don't necessarily call them British. Everywhere I've been, He's a Scottie. Or he's a p er Irishmen can be a Paddy and so on. And so I er never went the whole hog that way with thumping the British , British and best and so on. It could be and sometimes was, but i er the standard takes a lot of keeping up and er Much of the influence comes from newspaper and superior people implanting it on the population by reiterating these standards which often are wishful and they would like it to be so, but er They were hard days, they were hungry days. I was growing, but I'm now, I never got much higher than about five foot one and I weighed eight stone for a many years. But I was a little person in er a commu community of little person and er my brothers worked down the pit and I believe it was an advantage not to be much greater than five foot in height down the pits. It was the time of wooden pit props and er much kneeling and laying down and hacking away at the coal with picks and there was no mining machinery as we know it now. Could I? Could I just move you on a little bit? Having having talked about about your schooling to er . ask you about er family life and the impression that left upon on as you were growing up? W w what can you remember of your father? W w w what job did he have? And what kind of man was he ? Yes. My father worked on the railway and in my conscious life he was a supervisor, he was called an inspector, Inspector . He had two foremans worked under him, the purpose being they did the shifts, my father did all the writing for the Great Central Railway Depot, the marshalling yard or sorting out the trains. Strange to say, these trains do not come from other towns, say Birmingham, with er a trainload of stuff for Nottingham, they come with a trainload of stuff for here there and everywhere. And the person who had sorted it together at Birmingham made sure that the next stop it was at, the waggons would be at the back end to leave in that town and this is what my father was doing by er er shunting as it was called, or making a train up to go from Nottingham to London, or some other place in the country, with up to fifty or sixty trucks behind it and they didn't want the trucks next to the engine to be dropped off at the first place and having to shove and push about in their marshalling yard. It seemed a simple system when I got to know it, but wondered what it was all about, with chaps standing in different places and shouting and bawling where they wanted this waggon that was being pushed off, as he came running without the train they diverted it into siding, you see, sorting out a train. And it's not everybody's job to do that, so ordinary people took the jobs as shunters and could be taught how to do it in short time, if they were average and er in good health. Cos it's an outdoor job, it's a three shift system for those on the bottom, er early, morning and late, cos the eight hour day had come in at this time. Which would whe around when? When are we talking about now? Say about n nineteen? In the early nineteen twenties. We'd er Twenties. Yeah. er s er but those occupations that worked shift and had to go round the clock had to have eight hour shifts, three shifts. You could have earlies, lates and nights, which many people don't know, and I worked earlies, lates and night in engineering. Earlies er when I worked at the Ford Motor Company it meant getting from Ilford to Dagenham and starting on a machine at six A M in the morning, in the middle of winter or the middle of summer. And the next fortnight I would be on the afternoon shift, which meant getting the same distance, to half past two to work till They were eight hour shifts you see and the night shift likewise had to come a very er a tremendous number from working at the Ford Motor Company at Dagenham ev even in those days, travel from various places. And it's not all honey, starting somewhere at six in the morning if you live eight or nine miles off. There were not the multitude of motorcars about in those days, as there are now, but that was one of the firms that was trying to make it,and has done it, like that. So workmen have very irksome hours of work, unsocial hours I think they call them now, one of the most unsocial is the night shift. I've never been in any factory in my life, working nights, I have been in many, but I've never found my fellow men very sociable on the night shift. Actually you go there to work, but there is er a meal break and various things, you have contact with each other, either borrowing tools or sharing the use of them, but tempers get very short in the small hours of the morning and men get pretty tired. They can be It's no comparison with day work. Okay. Just to t to come back to what prompted you to to give us that interesting er little evaluation of the the differences that night and day work have men night and days to get get back to the beginning, to get back to your father? Yes. Erm y i i is it growing up ? Yes. On the railway. Yeah. Erm Well, I find, and still find, the clerical people are remote from reality. They they would think that a man er starting at eight in the morning will do as many and as quick for ten o'clock, as a man starting at night, or at six o'clock in the morning, or the afternoon shift. But it's not so. There's different tempos and I would think er on all the shifts there is a variation of production just because of the hour of the day. It is not natural to work through the night shift, I've worked it, there is no way of starting a week without your Er I've slept a night before, somewhere at the weekend, when the day comes, but you've got to go the next night to work. Even as a young person me mother used to say You'll need some sleep, you go to bed this afternoon, which I did, in obedience. But you know sleep escapes a young person, if one's in their young twenties and they think you can go to bed at er half past two in the afternoon and have an hour or two. It's not on. Er nowadays I've no trouble in dropping asleep in the afternoon No. but in the twenties I was better at the pictures or somewhere like that, which you could get for a few pence, but you're not walking about or doing tiring thing. Could I ask you then, when when you? When when was your first job? When did you leave school? And did you know what you were going to do when you left school? Well, my mother I left school and me mother said, the Labour Exchanges had come into being, er this was nineteen nineteen, they were in existence in Nottingham. And they had addresses and I ran around, I went to get a job at the pit, which er I had no more sense so I'm glad now that I didn't get on. And I found months and months after that most of the boys that got on there had their fathers work there, who went to the office, or asked the Butties, they used to talk about Butties in the pit, and I found this was short for deputy. Not er the th The employer deputized his authority and there was deputies in the pit, but never in factories. They have foremen, under-foremen, charge hands and so on, but in the pit they deputies down there. And er You passed up the chance to go the pit then? Yes. Inside a month, I was sent to an engineering place which was er close to where I live and I started there inside about a month. Can you remember the name of it?place ? It was the John and a very big factory in it's day, in as much as it was er four storeys high, rather high in those days for heavy machinery to be on level like that. And with the war ending the the Germans had had to pay reparations and that factory and many more were extremely busy because they were making lace machines for France. France was devastated and er they had always had a lace trade but we found in after years, this is a point that shouldn't be missed, that destruction by the Germans and the replacing under reparations, I understood the money came from, anyway the firm worked day and night for years, er left Nottingham the lace centre with the old pre-war machines and France and areas, including Italy, er with the modern machines. Even in villages, I known men who've worked abroad fitting them up in in er Germany and in France and in Italy, one of whom went to night school in Germany to learn the language t to get on better, he was there to receive machines. They're very big, like printing machines are . Yeah. Yeah. So i it was a thriving and booming factory because of this supply of machines through It was a working day and night and the er just as busy as the . wartime until, oh before, say, four years. And then much of this leeway was made up and the capacity being there er, well the hours of work were getting tackled then, they'd been longer hours and er I think as a a boy coming out of apprenticeship, er the forty seven hour week had come into being. Did you take an apprenticeship then? Yes. Yeah. I was apprenticed Yeah. and er worked till I was twenty one and you usually got the sack when you were twenty one, unless they were busy, very busy, they would say, You er, you won't get the full money at twenty one because er w I can get a man of forty one for that money. Th there's a t three a two year period where you'll be an improver, where you could have an increase in pay about every six months, bringing you up gradually. But should go to another factory and er hold your own in the factory you could expect to get the full money, which I did at twenty one. I went to Newark and got a job at , a ball bearing factory, and er they paid me the handsome wage of er two pounds sixteen for forty seven hours. It came to about one and three halfpence an hour. You have to allow the coins changed now, the three halfpence is not comparable with the present pence. But it was very low. Yeah. You wouldn't ten shillings for a day. Or it would be approximately ten shillings for a day because we had to work Saturday morning, although it was at Newark and got to travel twenty Yeah. miles there and twenty miles back. We Was it apparent to you at the time that the wage was low? Well to me it was a first time and being an unmarried man that I'd earned anything like it. It was the men there who were aggrieved, who had had better wages as the war had ended and there was such a rush on, wages had gone up, but the once the boom was got over they came down. And by er nineteen twenty six the engineers suffered a calamitous drop from about er four pound odd down to this two pound sixteen. Newark, by the way, was less than Nottingham because it was a country district. Nottingham considered to be more of engineering, not quite metropolitan, but varied trades and factories Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. and commanded a little bit more. Yeah. Was it was it difficult then to to to to have to have got a job in Nottingham, you had to go to Newark because it was w work wasn't as ava as as er As I said the er lace trade available in ? had er B building lace machines had er had it, in the term, and they started to diversify into a variation of the hosiery, which was quite another speciality. There were other places in Nottingham that had made nothing but hosiery machines and weren't quite as good as were at making lace machines. had a good reputation, although it was a non-union firm and n much maligned by er union people who disliked stand for not er sort of recognizing. You could work there being in a trade union but didn't have to say so. Yeah. See? It was kept small. But they made machines that did lace curtains, lace er is er a variant now, and er probably a thing of the past, but there was amazing things done on a lace machine. There's some in Nottingham, in one of the mus museum, that has the Nottingham coat of arms, I think it has the council house and various things, and it's all done mechanically on a huge machine that er is a repetition in each bay It's probably thirty, forty foot long, but in each bay of about seven foot it's separate curtain. But that machine can be doing, say eight curtains, coming off a bottom roller, being woven over and onto another one, till they're taken off. Endlessly, this pattern repeated endlessly, and the man could walk along and they'd all be working, he just goes with an assistant to er repair broken threads. They get broken, or the end of the line and so on, to join up you get a little blemish there which a repairer will do. So they they're pretty accurate er machines in a a pattern way, not a I found later in engineering where they needed things to the micrometer and the very, very fine measurement, very particular to the th the tissue paper difference between er er one thing and another wasn't good enough. It had got to be as near as thi thinness of tissue paper. We have feelers, metal strips, that are one and a half thou thick, we call it, you can't have them any thinner because they can make them in Sheffield at one thou thick but they suffer and bend by use. If you try to push them under a place to see if it's touching, you'll find they get bent up and once there's a bend in you can't smooth it. So the standard feelers for an engineer goes from about one and a half thou up to fifteen thou, the rest you can measure by other things. These are feelers. Y Yeah. You mentioned er earlier the trade unions and er you mentioned the the er middle twent middle nineteen twenties as a period of industrial un un un unrest. Yeah. W When when did you first join a trade-union yourself and get involved? When I er er were in the tool room at , Newark at the age of twenty one plus, you see, not twenty two er I was approached then by a shop steward who worked on the bench, was a fitter. I was always on a machine, cutting, milling machine. And I joined the the engineer's union, one Saturday night in Newark, had to go back there and they had meetings in the townhall, a room that was hired and er was er particulars taken and I've been in ever since. I'm still in the union, from nineteen twenty six to nineteen eighty three and next Monday I shall go to the branch cos I have an interest in the organization and the movement. I can't say it's been marvellously successful but I do know for a fact that the conditions of the working class was improved tremendously by organizations in the thing which has come to be described as trade-unionism. Er, there are abuses in some and variations and er not always a desire by everyone to belong to it, but the odd man out is often like a bad apple in a barrel. And er it's strange to me how an employer would be happy to have a room with a hundred and hope to get one or two who weren't, either for reasons of information or things that one couldn't trust from a worker. They are not in company in factories, there's antagonism between management and the shop floor. There is also the difference between employees who are in offices, who for some reason or other, I've always found and still do, they seem to have a notion that they're a different class to others who work for wages. They will talk about salaries and things like that but they're often paid, well, very remotely some of them, monthly now, and think that's er heavenly or something. But mostly, in my experience, they were paid just the same as we do we were, perhaps on a different day and a different method. We had to stand in a line. I've been to Newark on a Friday night and stood in a line with others on a night shift at a w wooden hut in the yard whilst a clerk from the pay office came to meet us, the day shift finishing at er, say five o'clock. He'd come half past seven to eight to pay us as we came to work, to hand us the money we'd earnt for the last week, always keeping about three days in hand. So employers, in my experience, even to the day I left, always owe the workman something for what he's done Mm. and it would appear in the simple times, before mine, even I had experience at Newark, that men could get a sub in the week because you're actually in two days you've actually earnt two days money and you haven't got it. And if a yarn was spun, or a general true story that a man had to have his train fare to get to Newark and he had to pay this and that, you could er get a loan on your wages. But you had to have qualified for it by working, see?end of the week and the only place I ever had one was at and because the foreman approached me, I'd been out of work and got the job by writing to it, going to the library and it was in one of the London papers, they wanted men for the tool rooms. I got to be working where they made the tools in that of the engineering shop and er I travelled on a Sunday from Nottingham to London and What year would this be? Just to put it into context ? Yes . Yes. Well, I'd be er I'd got er a daughter, nineteen twenty nine, I would say, nineteen twenty eight . Twenty nine, yes. I'd er at been at Newark till then for about four years or so and the er slump had come about and they were sacked by the hundreds, including myself. I asked the under-foreman what I'd done to deserve this, he says You're not on your own, there's er a quarter to go not having any new members? beg to differ Because,because I I do feel sorry, I I sorry I consider it for not having any young new members. But I do feel I do feel that er he will be, he will be assisted by having close people to clarify his thoughts for the council members. Now erm if he had any as somebody says, well no I think he has some thought er simply Might not be the correct ones. Simply confused. Erm, I think the charge that has been laid against myself personally and my myself and my colleagues is the charge of vacillation and changing our mind and I and I am grateful to c my colleague David for reminding us that we have in this county had two years two years when the Labour party and the Conservative party have been hand in glove, absolutely determined that the way forward in relation to homes, elderly persons homes, not that's not to close any and now we've had a complete volte face when they've changed their minds and they've come along with us. How interesting. Mr has also asked me whether it is true that if I can't get what I want second best will do. I think the argument should be put slightly differently. Would you prefer to have nothing rather than something? Because for two years for two years the intentions of the Conservative group, which have been the intentions of ourselves have delivered on the Moat Highfield questions, delivered nothing. That is the reality of what er Mike said and I'm sorry he pinched my line politics is the art of the possible and that is a message I'm afraid that the Conservatives on this council have never adopted. time and time again they sit on the sidelines saying this is what we think don't talk to us about it don't debate it, don't ask us to think about it, take it or leave it, if you don't give us what we want we'll sit back and moan and sulk and they've played, I think that's a very irresponsible line they've played in the five years I've been on this council and I hope that er again the issue on the next item on the agenda represents a change of heart on their behalf. of course goes on about what he always goes on about and er I would remind him that the supplementary estimates which is in the amendment here, is also in the amended motion which is proposed by the Conservatives and had all party support on every committee that it's come to. Finally I I would say that to erm Mike I think the amendment that is now before us which we are supporting goes considerably further than the original federative option. And has a combined budget which is in my view, the important thing that I believe was necessary in the life of the economic circumstances . That combined budget will inevitably involve a redistribution of resources you are going to live up to what you are now putting your name to. I don't think that Mr remarks were helpful. Because I don't think the question of what's going on outside Moat Centre today or yesterday or the day after, has a lot to do with the actual alternatives that we've been . What it does have a lot to do with is that the Moat Centre has not had clear significant management on the ground and what we're proposing here today should produce that in the very near future and what the proposals that Mr proposals would have done is not produced that in the significant future and I think that's the point that really needs to be stressed. Thank you. Mr It's not my day really earlier today I had to admit to being grateful to John Gummer now I'm gonna have to be. I know it's terrible isn't it I never thought I'd say that. Now I'm gonna have to say I'm gonna be grateful to Mr it's a really bad day. No I am grateful to Mr because he's finally crystallised in my mind something that's been bugging me the longer I stay on this council about exactly what the Tories see their role here as and it's now very clear to me, more than ever and that is that if you want to be obstructive and negative and if you go on long enough being obstructive and negative what you can end up doing is that you'll find yourself eventually in a position going on long enough that you can make totally meaningless speeches but at least you'll get nice headlines in the paper and that seems to me the whole essence of the Tory strategy. When my colleague to my right here, Roger and myself put forward a motion at last council on this issue ably led by our glorious leader to my left I would like to say that we've set up. Now what I would like to say is that we've made clear that we're with certain very clear objectives in pushing forward, in saying that certain things had to be achieved and when I read the lilac piece of paper or whatever colour we want to call it. I see a set of conclusions that achieve almost everything that was demanded at that time and I am grateful to everybody concerned who's actually sat down and actually really thought about what we're trying to do and everybody has made some compromise here and I shall certainly support this amendment and I shall make the compromise because the one thing in here that I thought was necessary that isn't there is the statement that there will be a head of centre and having actually worked in a project, head of sorry, head of project and having actually worked in a situation where I was a joint manager erm in the long run I think people will see the the wisdom of of a single head of project. But that's up fo that's up to people experience t t t t to conclude. But the main there 'ere is, we haven't actually changed our position we have actually stated clearly that we wanted to achieve something, we wanted to make sure that what was being provided in that community was the best best thing possible within the resources available and that things developed on This amendment takes us that way forward and we are at least being clear to our principles rather than just being negatively obstructive. Mr Thanks Chair. I just like to start off by saying and just reminding the council well in particular Mr in light of what he said that he doesn't understand what Mr is on about, well he's never understood the issue of the merger in Highfields. Mr has made more publicity on this issue than any other councillor. I think there's no issue in his patch that he might want to talk about. But he's made national headlines local and every other headlines that comes about regarding this issue of the merger. But I think in seconding this motion I think it's a way forward and I think it's better late than never I think what it talks about that we would not be here today Mr Chairman if this would have been agreed by what was put by the officers two and half years ago. It's not a federated system, it actually, positively talks about moving forward as Professor states it in the economical situation the council is in. It talks about one budget covering for the two centres and it also talks about two heads of centres which is more practicable and more rational than any other s situation that would have been if the merger decision would have stayed. There has never been an argument put by anyone to convince myself or people who have protested against the merger, a rational argument has never been put against what people have said that the merger is a rational way forward. I think it would have been a disaster and a recipe for disaster because practically if you know what the situation is in the Moat Centre and the Highfields youth and community centre then people would have never resisted to that change. I'm not saying that people would have never changed their ideas but if it would have been done in the manner that it would have been done in in the first place and if people would have been told about their future lives and if people had been, would've accepted what was going on in light of all the decisions that have been taken previously regarding the merger issue. I think these proposals not only are a way forward but also in light of what is actually happening in the area of Highfields with er the high numbers of unemployment, with the high rate of people underachieving in education I think for the last two and a half years there has been no clear guidelines or structure that has systematically brought about any results in the two centres to move forward where people have lost out by this issue being bureaucratic and a political football that's being kicked about and I think it's about time where we now have cross party consensus that we move positively forward and work towards these proposals. I mean in so I I come here today with a petition that I presented that also talks about proposing to abolish the merger, I mean this is a move just one step away from that but I still feel in what was proposed at the last full council meeting and I would express my views to the officers that in light of what has been suggested today is actually implemented to the wording as it stands because the joint working party that had been er written up previously never did meet although if I can inform it was only the officers who actually met up and I hope that in light of all the working group and the two heads of centres covering for each other would be implicitly applied. In light of er Near time all the consultation that also talks about in this paper is met with the two centres, the management committee of Highfields youth and commune centre and also the users of the Moat Centre and I think in light of everything that's gone on I think it's substantially a success to stand here and say that we have at least achieved some result and I I formally would welcome the Libs supporting this this afternoon and I'm grateful for the turn that the Libs have made and in light of er what er Mr the involvement Mr has put in. Time time time now please. Thank you. Thanks Chair. Mr do you wish the right of reply. No it's Mr Mr Not really Chair . I'm mean we've discussed it often but I I would be grateful if we could It's Mr I'd hate to stop Mr in full cry Okay then chairman I I would er recommend that we support the amendment moved by Mr . Right, those in favour. Right erm yeah look at the congress. Just wanna wrap this up now erm by bringing in the erm example of Greece. Er the er er Greek revolt. Erm just to recap on that slightly. It started round about eighteen twenty one although actually there there'd been erm er simmering discontent in the amongst the Christians in the Balkan area for some time. We we needn't worry too much that thought but erm the Greek revolt itself in eighteen twenty to one to round about eighteen twenty five had gone on without any European intervention. To some extent this was due to the influence of the er of of . Erm who was able to hold er the Russians back from intervening on the grounds that it would be er seen as intervention in a er in in in a revolt. Erm the revolt is of course essentially a nationalist revolt. I suppose there are liberal overtones in it but it's essentially a nationalist revolt. After eighteen twenty five of course erm the death of Alexandria especially of Nicholas Russia is more inclined to intervene especially as the Greek rebels are being defeated because of the mention the intervention of of erm Turkey's ally erm er Egypt Egypt a a a a problem for the Turkish empire . The ruler of Egypt Mohammed Ali intervened in the revolt on behalf of Turkey with the promise of territory in the area. Erm and the revolt begins to er er er crumble. Erm so Russia decides to intervene and at this point erm is especially concern of Britain. And the upshot is that in eighteen twenty six Britain suggests in essence holding a congress to discuss the er er Greek revolt. Erm Britain and France are very concerned about the prospect of Russian intervention. Erm And in essence a kind of congress is held at St Petersburg. It's not trotted out in the old history books as one of the conferences, or one of the congresses rather. In fact it's, it's more often referred to correctly as a conference. Erm it consisted of the ambassadors of the great, of the, of of the great powers erm er meeting together at St Petersburg. Erm it's there's a certain irony about all this. As we know erm Canning had to a great extent welcomed the end of the congress system. His famous comment about things are back to as they should be every nation for herself and god for us all. Erm but in twenty six he in a sense does a U turn. And he's concerned to get great power co-operation to solve the Greek er er problem. The other irony is of course that up until at the previous congresses like Verona erm Britain hadn't attended. At this one Austria doesn't attend. And same, well and and Prussia as well for that matter but they're not so, so important. At this conference the great powers involved are Britain, Russia and France. Of course the other irony as well is that the powers that meet at the conference at St Petersburg er the powers decide they will intervene in Greece. And they're intervening of course here on the side of a revolt which is going against the grain of erm of certainly for Russia of course of er of of the attitudes of the eighteen erm er eighteen teens early eighteen twenties. The idea was basically to produce some kind of semi-independent Greece. Er of course as we know or we might, some of us might know from er Brit. his. that erm from British History that erm in eighteen er erm the Turks refused to co-operate in this. And erm in when was it eighteen twenty seven at the Battle of Navareno the British navy sunk the Turkish fleet. Erm thus to a great extent erm ending the erm er the prospects of Turkish success. What what was that battle again? Navareno. Navar Avokea or Navareno Bay erm it's more, I think it's more technically known as Avokea See if they've got a reference to the . Oops. Oh no it is Nav I'm I'm sorry. I'm confused aren't I? It is Navareno. Yeah erm again you needn't worry too much about the er erm about the ramifications of this Kenning died in twenty seven and Britain to some extent disentangled herself from the Greek revolt but the upshot was that in eighteen thirty Greece became an independent state. Her independence guaranteed by Britain, Russia and France. Okay erm I suppose we ought to mention in this context as well er Belgium. I'll probably refer to it again later on . Er in Belgium of course in eighteen thirty erm a nationalist revolt broke out in response really to the French revolution of that year. Which we'll be looking at briefly in a sec. Erm this was a direct challenge to the Vienna settlement of course. As we know at the Vienna settlement, Belgium was put under er er er er essentially under Dutch rule. Erm Britain and France were prepared to defend Belgian independence. The other powers were er at odds with Britain and France ie Austria, Russia Prussia. So again we see a split in the er in in in amongst the great powers. What? I just It's Britain and France were prepared to support Belgian independence. Erm Russia, Prussia Austria not. And we are seeing in eighteen thirty a significant gap between on the one hand erm the western powers and on the other hand the east european or the central and eastern european powers. In eighteen thirty of course, the east european powers were unable erm er to intervene. Er Russia had erm a revolt in Poland to face. Austria faced disturbances in Italy. Prussia of course couldn't really act by herself. But we are seeing a widening gap. And indeed erm in the eighteen thirties we see the formation in the west of the so called quadruple alliance not to be confused with the great quadruple alliance of eighteen er thirteen. The quadruple alliance consisted of Britain, France, Spain and Portugal which had by now got sort of liberal constitutional governments. Well it's erm it's erm it's about, I think it's about eighteen thirty three thirty four. Doesn't really matter. It's the earliest, er early eighteen thirties. And on the other hand, Austria, Russia and er Prussia it's Munchengratz isn't it. forgetting me er me Munchen Yep. In fact they may even have a date for you here. Yeah eighteen thirty three Munchengratz. It's an agreement to defend each other against the threat of revolution. Yep. Erm So we are seeing by er the early eighteen thirties something of a formalized split between the er er the powers of er the quadruple and then the er quintsimple erm er alliance. I'm referring obviously to the quadruple alliance of eighteen er er fifteen. Okay perhaps we can er er wrap a few things up on the erm on the er Vienna er settlement and the congress system itself. What actually happened in Belgium? Belgium became independent. Sorry yeah. Belgium became independent. Erm it's ind , it's independence was recognized fully by all the major European powers by eighteen thirty nine. It was regarded as erm it was one of Palmerston's, one of Palmerston's great triumphs wasn't it? Isn't it the case that Palmerston when he was on his death bed had the clause to the Belgian treaty read to him to cheer him up. Okay erm let's perhaps make a few comments then about the Vienna settlement itself. The old er the old kind of chestnut question is was it a success or a failure? I I I'd say with the, with the revamped exam you're not likely, you're not likely to get a question like that. Was Vienna successful? But you're gonna get a much wider question if it comes up on this and erm perhaps in incorporating the congress system but let's approach it from that, that perspective anyway. I think the best way of looking at this is to kind of take an open-ended version of what the Vienna settlement is all about. Er not just the treaty in eighteen fifteen but the whole congress system erm after eighteen fifteen onwards and into the eighteen twenties and such like. Erm I suppose the er the classic interpretation of the er the Vienna settlements is that erm in in the nineteenth century was that it was a failure and there was a, there was a kind of er consensus beginning quite early actually. There's a kind of consensus view that in the language of ten sixty six and all that the Vienna settlement was a bad thing. Erm and I say this view is, is in some respects being er erm er expressed relatively early on. Erm and you even get it associated with leading rulers or states er statesmen of the day. For instance erm somebody like Napoleon the Third. He emerged as president of France as Prince Louis Napoleon in eighteen forty eight and he er he erm achieves power by coup d'etat and becomes emperor in eighteen fifty two. Napoleon the Third is someone who's er who sees it as one of his objectives to undo the Vienna settlement. Erm and you've got other leading figures of the day. Count Cavor prime minister of Piedmont in eighteen er fifty. Erm and someone who's described as perhaps one of the architects of Italian unity. He becomes the prime minister of of a relatively united Italy erm in eighteen er eighteen sixty. Cavor is someone who's er Right. Cavor is someone who's hostile er to the Vienna settlement. Let alone of course large numbers of liberal stroke nationalist erm revolutionaries within Europe in the eighteen er twenties, thirties and forties. The various national secret societies and various nationalist movements like er Young Italy and there's even one called Young Europe which is kind of a pretty, pretty much catch-all one. But the various nationalist societies or the revolutionary purpose. They're all hostile to the Vienna settlement. And that perhaps er having mentioned the nationalist erm societies this perhaps gives us a clue to it. The the view was taken that the Vienna settlement was hostile to liberalism and nationalism. That was the view taken that the Vienna settlement was hostile to liberalism. It was hostile to nationalism. And therefore it was wrong because the argument goes that liberalism and nationalism are the great triumphant er ideologies of the nineteenth century and the Vienna settlement's not only wrong, but it was historically erm in a sense doomed because it was trying to oppose the growing erm unstoppable er ideologies of er erm of er of Europe. By the way erm it's always rather amusing when you see in the old history books the er the idea that erm that, to give an example, somebody like Metternich. You get the old idea that Metternich ignored liberalism and nationalism. Erm that's a very, a very misleading way of putting it. Metternich in many ways thought of little else except liberalism and nationalism. The Vienna settlement didn't ignore liberalism and nationalism. It tried its best to clobber it. It tried its best to actually er suppress it. And don't forget erm perhaps we ought to say a word on the er on the conservative's side here. Erm don't forget it's people like Metternich and indeed Castlereagh and the other erm er figures at the Vienna settlement. They were looking back in eighteen fifteen at twenty odd years of war and revolution. And if that was you know you could, I supp , you could argue that the French revolution had been built on notions of liberalism and it had encouraged nationalism in Europe. And therefore you could associate liberalism and nationalism with war, terror erm and perhaps therefore it wasn't all that desirable. Obviously as well in Metternich's er er, in Metternich's case nationalism would be the end of the Austrian empire. Because the Austrian empire, the Habsburg empire was a conglomeration of large numbers of different nationalities. Nationalism affected other great powers as well. Erm Russia Russia in eighteen fifteen grabbed Poland. Prussia had, still had chunks of Polish territory little bits of it. Prussia of course more especially more especially Prussia feared a united Germany. If you brought, if you got a united Germany then Prussia would simply be a small part of that united Germany. So it's important to note that nationalism the prospect of nationalism was seen as undesirable by the er major European powers. It didn't nationalism had no erm wouldn't affect France as such. Didn't affect Britain. Well it affected Ireland. There was always the problem of Ireland. I think it's a bit wrong perhaps to say it didn't affect Britain. Perhaps it didn't affect Britain at this time. But as we know from British history one of the understated reasons why erm there was a lot of hostility to home rule for Ireland in Britain was because of the fear of the creation of a hostile state er erm off, off Britain's shore. Erm so that's one aspect of Vienna. It was seen as being opposed to liberalism, as opposed to nationalism and perhaps there were, there were er, there were, there were good reasons er for that. By the way erm are we relatively clear what's meant by liberalism and nationalism within this context? Should I perhaps digress and say a little word erm er about this? Perhaps I will. It's perhaps of some interest to us that erm these to great -isms, liberalism and nationalism I think we can see them as products of the French revolution. Or indeed products of perhaps enlightened attitudes, certainly with the case of liberalism. In a sense, if we think of the context of say the late eighteenth early nineteenth century perhaps more, perhaps more specifically we think of the er, of the er erm early nineteenth century. Liberalism and nationalism are seen as two sides of the same coin. They were seen as inextricably bound up. Erm all liberals were nationalists. And to er, I suppose by and large, vice versa as well. Erm as I've said the er the the two er known as the two -isms. The two ideologies are by and large products of the revolution or in the case of liberalism perhaps of the of enlightened attitudes. By liberalism liberalism meant a number of things. It meant primarily constitutional government. It meant primarily constitutional government. Written constitutional government. Liberalism. Oh. It meant by and large constitut , it meant, it meant primarily rather constitutional government. Liberals would look to for instance the con the United States' Constitution. They would look to the er er to the constitution of of of France in say seventeen ninety one or the more radicals amongst them would look erm the more er the more radical liberal if that's not er, if that's not a, not a contradiction in terms, don't think it is. They would look to the constitution of eighteen, of seventeen ninety three. Others, other in nineteenth century Europe looked to the constitutions granted in eighteen twelve for instance in Spain and in Naples. These aren't er er er they tend to be a bit ignored in history, these. But they're of interest. In eighteen, in in late eighteen twelve erm with the prospect perhaps of Napoleonic rule in difficulties you see in some of Napoleon's, some of the client states of Napoleonic Europe Spain, Naples you see constitutions being granted which are are pretty democratic actually. And th the they're looked to by er European liberals as as model constitutions. When you get a revolt in Spain in the eighteen twenties. What is the revolt in favour of? The revolt is in favour of the constitution of eighteen twelve. So they believe in constitutional governments. Erm now obviously in the context of constitutional governments it's not, one can imagine having a constitutional form of government without, without a parliamentary system but erm it's perhaps a bit of a stretch of the imagination. But they mean by, erm constitutional government they also er er liberals also believed in the notion of parliamentary government. It's very much connected to late enlightenment notions that the only valid government would be representative government. Other forms of government are in a sense illegitimate. Absolute rule. Monarchical rule. Well not necessarily, I mean, unless the monarch was was was er, was part of the constitutional set up. But representative government was the only really legitimate form of government. Of course, there was debate amongst liberals on how much representation there would be. Or to put it, erm erm erm more simplistically how, how many people would have the vote. Erm we see this within the context of the reform movement in Britain after eighteen fifteen. Where you've got reformers ranging from those who want the household suffrage er household suffrage. A vote to all householders. Across to those who wanted erm erm a universal male suffrage. Erm one man one vote. Erm European liberalism is based upon, is based upon context as well of secularism. Or to perhaps er put it more to put it, to make it more erm obvious anti-clericalism. This didn't necessarily mean hostility to religion as such. But the notion of secularism, the notion of anti-clericalism meant that within the liberal states erm the er er there would be a separation of church and state. Erm the church would have no role within the state as being say in a erm erm in other words there would be erm the catholic church in in erm in say er a state like France er should not be the established church. There would be a separation of church and state. And by and large the activities of church and state would be separatist. The church would play no role in the affairs of state. Erm Other notions erm of liberalism of course again which are perhaps pretty obvious freedom of speech and implied in that freedom of religion, freedom of expression, that kind of thing. But in essence they're the main er er the main aspects of er of of er what was meant by liberalism in the er in in er the nineteenth century. Erm it perhaps doesn't strike us as being very revolutionary but of course it depends from the context that you're in erm to perhaps some of the absolute rulers of er of er perhaps, this was revolutionary. Erm What about nationalism? Nationalism we perhaps some of the er er some of the erm concepts of nationalism appearing even before the French revolution. You begin to see er in erm in parts of Europe in the er later eighteenth century a growing emphasis upon er er upon language, literature of of certain areas. I'm thinking of Italy here primarily. Erm as it develops under the impact of the French revolution and Napoleonic rule and then later what nationalism came to be seen as it's the basically the idea that erm that people of a common culture history and language should occupy perhaps that's the wrong word. Er should er should have a separate state. Should not be ruled by a foreign power. So a people with a common culture, history, language should live in a separately defined state. And certainly should not live under the rule of a foreign er power. And our classic examples of course there erm of of of this situation in in post eighteen fifteen Europe are Germany, Italy Poland . Now I've I've suggested that erm in the early nineteenth century, liberalism and nationalism are very much bound up. Er all, all nationalists in a sense are liberals, or liberals are nationalists. One aspect of this of course, one reason er er behind this is is the French revolution. Let's not forget that erm under Napoleonic rule you do see the creation of a so-called king of Italy. It's northern Italy. Erm Napoleon happens to be it's king and and it is very much a client of France. We see the creation of of of the confederation of the Rhine. A a kind of erm united Germany. Erm within, in these states as well you,th the the nationalism of them, although it's in the French direction. It's associated as well with the ideology of Napoleonic France. Erm which does imply an attack on the old feudal regimes er er er previously existing. Erm so after eighteen fifteen there is this link between liberalism and nationalism. I don't wanna go much er er further ahead on this for the moment. We do tend to see liberalism and nationalism parting company. Especially after eighteen forty eight. And as ag I will, I'll be returning to this obviously in consideration of Italy and Germany, but it is perhaps worth making this point now. You do see liberalism and nationalism parting company. Erm and you do get this growing awareness that not all of that while all liberals might be nationalists. All right thinking liberals in Europe from Gladstone in England you know. All right thinking liberals support nationalist aspirations. Gladstone a great advocate of Italian unity for instance. Gladstone an advocate of er of of Balkan nationalism. He wanted Turkey out of the Balkan er er out of south eastern Europe. So all good European liberals are nationalists. It starts to become apparent, very very clear that not all nationalists are good liberals. In fact far from it. Erm if the choice is between securing er your er securing your own state. Securing the nationalist goal and ignoring the liberal goal, many nationalists will go for the nationalist goal. If the price of bringing about your united state is the dumping of liberals, then so be it. In that sense nationalism of course er it perhaps becomes a more dynamic and problematic ideology in nineteenth century Europe. So I I've digressed er from er considering what erm erm er what this has got to do with the er erm congress of Vienna but I think it's er hopefully er er a worthwhile erm er digression. Erm let me turn er briefly to the those who have something good to say about the Vienna settlement. It's had it's supporters er one is always reminded that one of it's key supporters, the former American er er secretary of state and and at the moment, globe-trotting world expert er Henry Kissinger. Kissinger erm who began life as a er er as professor of history. His first major work was a defence of the Vienna settlement. Erm and it it it, it has been defended on a number of grounds. It's been argued by it's supporters that it ushered in an era of peace. Erm At it's most extreme interpretation there's an argument that erm, that the Vienna settlement was a factor in maintaining peace in Europe between eighteen fifteen and nineteen fourteen. Because it's extreme supporters suggest that that it wasn't until nineteen fourteen that a war broke out involving all the great European powers. Erm one would argue that's er that's er, that's an extreme erm er view. Erm there are wars in Europe after eighteen fifteen. And some people might argue the Vienna settlement was a factor in bringing about some of these wars. So it's again, unfortunately it's it comes down in one of these erm pays your money takes your choice erm er arguments. But it is worth making the point that for instance if we take a look after eighteen fifteen of, at the wars. There's war between Russia and Turkey in er eighteen er thirty when Russia militarily intervenes in the Turkish revolt. Of course there's the war war between Russia and Turkey as well in the in in in the eighteen seventies. But for the moment I'm just looking perhaps nearer to the Vienna settlement itself. Erm there's war between er you get the Crimean war between Russia on the one hand and Great Britain and France on the other. And it's always worth remembering about the Crimean erm episode that Austria in essence intervenes on the side er er intervenes not so much on the side of Britain and France but against Russia. Austria played a decisive though non-military role in er in in the Vienna, in in, in the er in the Crimean war. Erm and then we have the so- called nationalist er wars. For instance eighteen sixty four between Denmark and Prussia and Austria. Technically Prussia and Austria here representing the German confederation. It's a war concerning the vexed and famous Schleswig-Holstein dispute of course which I'm sure we're all familiar with. The erm eighteen sixty six war between Prussia and Austria. These are, this is the war which essentially brings about German er unity under Prussian erm erm control. Prussia is the victor of course of this war. shock win for Prussia. Shock win for Prussia! What a kind of er foo sport's page headline isn't it, yeah? . If what you're suggesting is there was an expectation that Prussia might not win the war. Yeah. And given the fact don't forget, it's always worth remembering this and I've I've made, I'll be making the point later on. Most of the German states supported Prussia in the Austrian Prussian war. Including the states. Supported Austria sorry. Supported Austria. Not supported Prussia. I think . Now of course there are the wars for Italian erm er unification. Eighteen fifty nine. A war between Au between Austria on the one hand and France and technically Piedmont on the other. Although the Piedmontese army didn't arrive until the battles were over . There was war between on the one hand Austria and the other hand France and Piedmont. Erm and then of course in a sense almost bringing these things together the, the major and perhaps most influential of these er wars. The war between France what is normally referred to as the Franco-Prussian war. I suppose to be technical it ought to be the er it ought to be referred to as the Franco- German war. It ought to be a war between France and a united Germany. But as it is, it is primarily Prussia that's er involved. The war between France and Prussia. Eighteen seventy to seventy one. The argument is, is that okay these are, that certainly erm we see a number of wars in er nineteenth century Europe. But the argument is well they're not very big wars are they? They're they're short er wars. They range I mean er the the er the er Prussian Austro-Prussian war of eighteen sixty six is is referred to as what the six weeks war and and erm the five, five weeks of that or or or whatever were were involved in peace negotiations. The war itself was just three days. Erm there was only one battle in it you know but That erm that the war between France and erm and and and Austria was fought in June erm essentially in June of er of eighteen er fifty nine. They are short wars, the argument is. The same with the Dan Danish Austro. Danish war the wars in Denmark and Austria and Prussia one might imagine a rather short- lived er war. How long did it take ? Well not very long. I suppose it's erm in in that sense erm er I I I I can see what you're, this, I don't think that's a factor in in in the, in the erm in in the fact that these wars are short. I think these wars are short because they're fought for limited objectives. They don't tend to escalate. Because the, because only one or two of the powers are involved in them. Or three perhaps in in in in the Crimea. Erm Nevertheless, to some extent the wars reflect the breakdown of the Vienna settlement. So it's a kind of a strange argument to suggest on the one hand the Vienna settlement was a factor in in preventing wars between all the great , er major war involving all the great powers. Erm when at the same time the Vienna settlement appears to be crumbling like after er erm after eighteen thirty or something. Of course erm it's perhaps, perhaps it's looking slightly to the er historical future it it's er it it was bad news in one sense because erm there came to be a view taken in Europe that wars between the great powers would be short, sharp wars. And hence the feeling in nineteen fourteen when the first world war broke out that it would er all be over by Christmas. Because it, cos people were you know erm as is often said generally of of a of a general staffs of armies. They're always fighting the previous war. There was this view that the first world war would be rather like a re-run of some of these wars at the end of the nineteenth century. Erm which didn't turn out to be the case. Erm so I would say, I'll just wrap this up erm on on erm on on on this point the er by making by introducing the fact that some, some historians have argued that these wars were short. Okay they had limited objectives. They were correcting the Vienna settlement. That's in a way how you can perhaps square the circle. You can argue these wars were corrective. Erm And the other factor that that's introduced as well is that the powers got into the habit of meeting in congresses. And you do see erm in the nineteenth century erm the powers still meeting together. For instance at the end of the Crimean war in eighteen fifty six the peace treaty that's er er that's held is actually a congress. All the powers attended the eighteen fifty six treaty of Paris. It's not just a a peace treaty signed by it's not just, er it's not just a direct signing of a peace treaty between say France Britain, Russia. It turns into a congress. The congress of Berlin eighteen seventy eight. When it appears that there might be a major outbreak in erm in in in in south eastern Europe. The powers do perhaps get into the habit of erm of erm of meeting together. Okay anyway, we'll er leave it at that then for the moment. Chairman appointed to E I P and to the North Yorkshire number three. Can I say that the purpose of the E I P is to examine the various issues that have been id identified for discussion. And the panel's role is to report on those issues. Er we are not required or intending to look at objections which have been submitted on other aspects of the structure plan. We are simply concerned with those issues which we will be discussing over the next erm eight days or so. The er other aspect I think erm for the purpose of those who were not at the er pre meeting, is to introduce the other panel member, and that Miss Roz who is a senior inspector, with the planning inspectorate on my right. On my left is the panel secretary Mrs Clare . And of course you will already be aware of the er program office which is outside just off the corridor. Now can I get some of the mechanics out of the way first of all before we before I ask North Yorkshire to make a start with their presentation? Firstly, I presume that those who want lunch, sandwiches here have already er taken care of their order. I would also like to add that the small meeting room which is off the corridor, opposite the program office, is ava available for you to er relax during the lunch break, and eat your sandwiches in there, rather than bring them into the hall. The other thing I would like to make sure and this applies also to the members of the public as well as those people who are participating in the discussion, could you please make sure that you have registered for the day. Er you can do that during the coffee break if you haven't already done so. now some of you will also have seen a form being circulated, asking you to agree that the recordings that are being made of the discussions, can be used as part of a research project. Certainly I was asked about this er well before the er E I P er and we agreed that there w Well certainly I agreed that I could see nothing wrong with that since it is a cl closed research project, and nothing will be divulged at all er publicly. Apart from which of course, that everything we say is being held in public session in any event. The recordings are available for you if you wish or will be available for you if you wish to er improve your memory on what has been said during the discussion periods. I must add that we will not be producing daily summaries, er I think it's a task which is a fairly daunting on and quite frankly, er they will not be produced in the sense At the end That they would not be available at the end of each day. Erm as I say, the recordings will be available if you wish to refresh your memory. They will be held during the course of the E I P here, otherwise they will be help by the county council. Now I was about to make a comment that er well most of you know who who you are and where you're sitting, er those that have already done that have turned their name tags round so we can see. Er one or two others, I would welcome that. We can identify you more readily that way. In terms of progressing or taking part in the discussion, can I suggest that if you want to come in on a particular item, you put your name board up like that, so that we can readily observe it er and equally, our friend who is looking after the microphones can make sure that the vol the volume of your microphone is turned up at the appropriate time. I don't think you wish us to tamper with the microphones at all do you? No, fine. Now if I can move on to today's session, we are going to concer concerned ourself obviously with housing land applications and primarily with matter one A. But before before I ask North Yorkshire to introduce the matter, can I put H B F on notice that I would like them to follow on from North Yorkshire, when they have made their contribution. I would also like to say that er whilst we are going to talk about the housing allocations in the sort of strategic sense, across the county first of all, there are as you will remember er the matters of some disagreements, differences of opinion on demographic issues. I raised this at the pre-meeting and asked that the various participants should have a look at those issues where they had areas of disagreement to see whether or not er they could reconcile those. And I I would like that to be touched on as well. Er by North Yorkshire. I think s the differences in some cases ar are so large that it's inescapable er that we have a discussion on. The other thing, and this is a case of where the panel bites back as it were. We have laid on the table, two tables, P S O one and P S O two. Erm and what we have done in compiling these tables and this has been done by the panel secretary, is to take from the various submissions of the participants, the various housing figures, the the various projections of likely need, of the housing requirement and the effective summary really is in P S O one, but when you look at P S O two er there's a little more detailed work gone into that. Now could I ask, if there are any erm matters on there where you have found and error and it's an error of fact, can I just stress that at this stage? Erm could you let the panel secretary know er about that this mo sometime this morning, but certainly er in time for our start of the afternoon session. But we felt the tables themselves, could provide a useful background er and in having had them compiled, they point up some rather interesting issues, which we would return to eventually. Now if I can pass on and ask Mr from North Yorkshire, who first of all is going to give you an introduction which in effect which effectively will set the context of alteration number three. And then I presume Mr you'll go on to deal with matter A one A. Yes that's correct Mr , er it will be brief. Well ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of this examination in public, it would probably be helpful to all present and participating, if the county council explained why this alteration is necessary, and the relationship of its content to regional and national guidance. Well now in case anyone present is uncertain, erm of the geography of the county, there is a plan displayed er on the board er at the back of the room which w should help er in that circumstance. The county is the largest by area in England, it borders two conurbations to the North and South, it's unique environmentally, both in its natural and built form. having two national parks, two and half areas of outstanding natural beauty, a heritage coast and a wealth of historic towns er and villages. The county council believes that North Yorkshire, the character of it, er is a national asset, but there is a view that because the county is large and relatively sparsely populated, there should be almost what appears to be an open door policy for development. We for our part are unaware of any statement of national policy that requires sparsely populated counties to be earmarked for development. Well now, the starting position today is that the North Yorkshire County Structure Plan was approved by the Secretary of State in November nineteen eighty. Together with subsequent alterations in January nineteen eighty seven and August nineteen eighty nine. I think it's fair to say that the Secretary of State has accepted that the special character of North Yorkshire, require a balance to be struck between environmental protection and development in the county. And we consider that this approach enjoys widespread support in North Yorkshire. Now district councils and National Park committees have approach in pursuit of their own plan making activities and although statutory local planning coverage in the county is still incomplete, the planning process at both county and district level, generally aims to meet the Secretary of State's wishes for North Yorkshire. As during the examination in public into the first alteration, this E I P will demonstrate again the wide measure of agreement between county and district councils. And we for our part think that this counts for a lot. As to the reasons why this alteration is necessary, the county council thinks there are three reasons, The first is to reflect the wish of government that the development planning system er is up to date, second and more practically, to provide a context for district wide development plan, and third, the urgent need to resolve the future strategic planning direction of greater York. As far as up to date development plans is concerned, this is supported by all sections of the community and need not be dwelt upon. An appropriate conte for context for district wide plans is necessary because the approved structure plan only extends to nineteen ninety six. Quite clearly the time horizon needs to be extended to allow structure plan numeric policies to provide clear guidance, not least in respect of a supply of land for housing in the county. District councils are presently making good progress on the development plans and appro and an approved alteration is clearly essential for that process. Well now the third factor, Greater York, has probably been the single most important planning issue for the county council and the Greater York districts over the past ten years. The ingredients I think we well know. A greenbelt agreed in principle by the Secretary of State but yet to be defined statutorily, a general absence of consensus on where future development in Greater York should be located, and increasing intervention by the Secretary of State on planning applications in Greater York. The county council and the five Greater York district councils began to address the issue in nineteen eighty eight and have spent five years in moving toward this examination in public. That might seem like a long time, but the issues have clearly been complex, and have been progressed as quickly as possible not least through vigourous prodding by the D O E, keen to see approval of a long term development strategy for Greater York and more importantly, a statutory definition of the York gre greenbelt. Well we think that the D O E would probably be quite pleased with the position that we reached today. During the period since nineteen eighty eight, the Greater York authorities have agreed a long term development strategy involving a new settlement contribution. This enabled progress on a York greenbelt local plan which in April nineteen ninety three completed a seven month public enquiry. The county council further accepted that an alteration to the approved structure plan was necessary to legitimize the strategy as the approved structure plan made no provision for it. That has also been progressed as concurrently as possible with the greenbelt local plan. So here we are today, almost at the end of a very long process, having experienced a wide ranging debate about the future of Greater York and numerous consultation exercises. The E I P today is probably one of the last pieces in the jigsaw. The completion of which will at long last resolve strategic planning issues in Greater York. Well of course this process pr could just as easily have been progressed through a full scale review of the structure plan rather than an alteration. As far as a full scale review of the structure plan is concerned, there is no doubt in the county council's mind, that such a full scale review would have significantly extended the process when all the players wish to see rapid progress, particularly to deal with the problems of Greater York. In nineteen ninety, the county council did consider the merits of a full scale review as against an alteration. It accepted that while there were arguments for a full scale review, the priority had to progress on an alteration which as quickly as possible, established the principle of a Greater York new settlement and progress on the greenbelt local plan. This approach was supported by the regional office of the Department of the environment. It is an alteration therefore that is t to be debated at this E I P and its coverage is relatively straightforward, though its content controversial. Policy H one provides the numeric provision for dwellings in the county after two thousand and six. Policy H two is a new policy which makes provision for a new settlement to help meet the development needs of the Greater York area. Policies I five and I twelve provide for land for employment in the period up to two thousand and six, while in the T policies, the opportunity is taken to update road schemes in the county. Finally, with the support of our district council, the dis the county council seeks to correct a serious omission of strategic planning policies for North Yorkshire, the inclusion of policy E two of a policy to control development in the countryside. All the policies have been the subject of consultation, but in the case of policy H two, we've experienced almost five years of continued discussion and debate first of all through the Greater York study and then through this alteration. The county council believes that policy H two is essential for the future of the Greater York area. The policy even has the distinction of attracting from the regional office of the Department of the Environment, in the paper to be considered at this E I P, a phrase of mild support. All these efforts do need of course to be assessed against their compliance or otherwise with national and regional guidance. The former in large part embodied in P P G, the latter in regional planning guidance for York and Humberside, yet to be issued by the Secretary of State. As far as the former is concerned, planning policy guidance, we will have different views. Certainly this alteration will ensure the strategic policy in North Yorkshire is up to date. And the alteration will address issues clearly appropria appropriate to structure plans. The the policies will be much debated, with quotes from various P P Gs, probably selective, being used by both the county council and objectors to justify their position. In any event, P P Gs are carefully drafted to ensure that few options are closed off. The county council does feel comfortable about the compliance of its alteration with national planning guidance. As far as regional planning guidance is concerned, there is none. It's quite clear, the needs of sensible planning require progress on development plans. nowhere has this been more evident than in Greater York. While P P G twelve provides for a cascade of planning policy, I suggest that only a purist would delay a resolution of the needs of Greater York, through the development plan process, in order to await regional planning guidance. In any event, the draft regional advice which has recently been the subject of consultation, does not conflict with this alteration, though Leeds and Bradford have reservations on the level of housing provision in North Yorkshire. We think the Secretary of State's present wish for ordered planning will benefit from the discussions at this E I P. There are I suspect, few organizations represented around this table, public or private, that would wish a delay in decision. Finally panel, the county council considers that the issues raised in this alteration require early decision and not in two or three years time. It is the county council's responsibility to bring forward proposals to enable progress to be made. The county council has taken those decisions and we think they ought to be debated vigorously and following that discussion, the panel will come to its conclusion. The county council therefore commends this alteration to the panel. That's all I would like to say . You don't wish to pursue in slightly more detail in terms of your introduction,th the issue one A which is the is the housing provision reasonable ? Ye Yes indeed I do. I was taking a step at a time and Yeah well I'm quite happy. Okay. Can I can I just say before you start Mhm. Er I should have reminded everybody at the beginning, when you wish when you start to speak, would you please introduce yourself, give your name and who you represent. So we can make absolutely certain on the recording. That's each time. Sorry Mr . Before we start chairman, I wonder whether we can make sure that Peter , North Yorkshire County Council, that all round the table have got the relevant North Yorkshire paperwork. And I think the documents that we have put in are N Y one,posi various positions er statements, Paper N Y two, described as population household economic activity rate projections, assumptions and methodology. N Y three is a county council commentary on the regional census study, funded by the local authorities and the D O E. N Y four is a paper entitled Housing Growth Provision. And then we miss a number erm er and move to N Y eleven which is a paper which we have put in which attempts to look at the differences between certainly between the they But I'm not gonna change, if anybody don't, but if they can't accept me No, I don't really think so ! well they must er Well er , you can't say that it's hard to understand because I'm a Londoner and Yeah. for a long time I have been Yeah. and you never say anything that I don't understand, unless you were to use a word like crome. Well quite Oh yeah. a word, an Yeah actual word Yes. Yeah. that you've never come across. Yeah. Mm. But after all, once is enough, and once you know, you know don't you? Exactly! You don't forget. No! No. Erm You don't. No. No I That's right. I found coming into Suffolk from Hertfordshire I hadn't heard the, any East Anglian dialect before at all erm I didn't find it difficult, there were only two cases and I can remember thinking there were two people er, one of whom is still alive, er who I had great difficulty in understanding and I thought when I can follow both of them without any difficulty I shall know I really belong. Yes. And, it didn't take long with one of them, that was Dennis Mm, Dennis . and the other one, I don't know whether you knew him, I think he lived in Earlsome for a time didn't he? No, well Monksome Didn't he? Monksome Monksome Erm, a chap called Ben erm No, I don't No. I expect he was days before and my word he was difficult to follow! Was he? Yeah. Yes. Er he spoke fast, that was the problem, most Oh yes! Suffolk people don't. No, they don't. They give you time to listen and time to think They do. but he spoke quickly with a very strong accent and that Yes. took me a lot of years before I could and I was so pleased when once I was able to say to you I've Ben had been in the shop and we'd had a chat hadn't we? Yeah. You and me and him and Joe , was another Yeah. one and we'd had a chat for a long, long time and I said to him afterwards, I was able to understand everything he said! Wonderful! I was so pleased ! That's an achievement ! Yes ! You know one thing that's striking me at this moment actually, when you talk about when you came into Suffolk and you Mm mm. met er, Hector and you told me once before you had no eyes for anyone else there. That's right. Perfectly true! Erm , in these days when er, so large a proportion of marriages breaks down Mm. erm it seems to me that the marriage that has an interest to your occupation, let's say, in the man's hands Mhm. if you like Mhm. er, although you've got your own artistic contribution which you also combine with True, yes. Hector's work That has been a great erm strength to us. Oh, I think that's a a tremendous Yes. strength to a marriage! Yes. Yes. I feel the same with Noel Yes. if there's something really interesting that you have Yes. between the two Yeah. of you Yes. Yeah. erm, you don't give up at the first little hurdle. Course you don't! No, No. No It makes an incredible bond doesn't it? Doesn't it? Absolutely! Yeah. I feel that. Yes! Yeah. Yes. Makes it a good recipe for a good marriage. Ooh yes! Yeah. Yes. It really does! And I th , I think about a great deal because it's a very strange, it's a very strange thing to talk about but when I came to Suffolk, I might have told you this before er, I had hardly been away from home at all, I was only seventeen when I first met him Mm. and I had a very sheltered life, I was an only child, I hadn't been around much, I hadn't stayed away from home erm and I came to Suffolk to visit a girl penfriend who was working at Brandeston Hall and erm she at that time was expecting to get engaged to a chappy in the village here who was, and still is a friend of Hector's and ours, and they didn't marry in the finish but she at that time wanted me to come up to Suffolk to see her and to meet this chappy who she thought she was going to marry and erm so, it was holiday from the art school where I was and I thought well why not? I'll erm, I'll venture and, and my parents said yes, that would be alright and so er so I came along and erm of course, it happened that he was in the he was in the forge talking to Hector on the first evening I came and that was how we met. Mm. And erm,i it was an extraordinary thing! But added to that, I can well remember staying at Kettleborough Chequers erm and er walking along from Kettleborough to Brandeston erm th the very next morning after I'd come here and I think it was before I think it was quite likely before we had we had actually met, I don't know whether it was the first day or the second Yeah, that we met in in the shop there but the strong impression I had is walking over the hill from Kettleborough where the gun club now is walking down into this valley and seeing that view of this little end of the village nestling in the hollow and I can remember feeling a extraordinarily strong sensation that I could easily live there Yes. I could belong there Yes. and I had never felt it anywhere else and I've never felt it since! Isn't that wonderful! But it, there was something that felt right. I yes, I really believe in that Yes. feeling! A sense of belonging. Most extraordinary! I belong here. Yes. Yes. Because I hadn't been around much, I hadn't been away from home Really? and i it was quite forcible! Yes. And er Marvellous! Yes. I think if one's receptive to things like that Yes. you know, it si , it Yes. it strikes you Yes. doesn't it? Yes Mm. It does. And er There was a rightness about it. And you don't forget it because No! you're young enough to be so impressed by it. Mhm. Yes. Yes. That's wonderful! Yes, there was a rightness about it. Right. Okay . Ha. Erm and er I've felt that same sense of rightness at many times over these years, this is now our thirty seventh year? Thirty seven, yeah I Nineteen think so. No, thirty eight. Thirty eight. This is nineteen ninety two. Yeah. This'll be our thirty eighth year in December. So it's several. Erm there have been times doing work which we have er, worked on together different jobs when I have thought, yes this is what I'm here for. Yes. Very, very strongly! Yes. And never, never more so than, of course, working on the sword stand. Yes. Never more so than that! That was wonderful I thought wasn't it? I the work I'd done in the past the training I've had the experience I've had with Hector and his work that was all leading up to that. All coming to it. It all came together. Yes. I can quite see that really. It all came together. Because Yes. that was a whole thing wasn't it? It was the culmination. Connection with the Yes. city. It was! It was! Er Mhm. the ancientness of the Mm. actual Yeah. thing Mhm. you were copying. The significance of what it was for. For. Absolutely! Yes. Everything Absolutely! about it. And now, of Yes. course, it sits Mm. America with Yeah. Mm. its sword in it Yeah. Mm. on certain occasions. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. It's a it's a permanent tribute to your It's collaboration It's an extraordinary forever in America. it is an extraordinary thing, an Yes. amazing, an amazing sensation Yeah. for it to be, isn't it? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. It's wonderful! Yes. Yes. And erm Feel like I've done a shift already. I know. We haven't been away. It's the time of year where you're starting to think I wonder if we'll be nearly finished. I'm yawning already! I know. I dunno what I'll be like at seven o'clock tonight. Mm.

And then once Helen and that had woken up that was about half eleven she woke up and then it like, oh,our provisions and then we started talking and everything else together like Do you work from half eight till half eleven? Well, she . I didn't, I work, I started at half nine and I finished at half ten and I went to you know. I started about five to eleven, and I finished at twelve. Then I had to get ready to go to the bank. To get the So is Tony gonna be staying awake until the time that you finish there? Well I was saying to Alison, the only thing I can do is when I phone him he's gonna come. Go this morning and then come straight here. Oh! More than likely. I know. I know. Maybe she'll stay at work and come and pick me up. So either way one of you's gonna be hanging around. I mean, either you've gotta hang around in the morning, or he's gotta hang around at night. Don't know. Is, is he leaving before then or what? Or you gonna take the car or get the bus? No I'll take the car. I could never get the bus here. Your telling me!

But erm I felt as though, I felt exactly the same, I felt I'd just been asleep I just had my eyes shut and I felt opening one eye to have a look out and see what people were doing. That's like that is it? So then People were looking at you. and then I was away and he wasn't there any more and I thought, what do I do now?

Cos I'm sick of telling people that don't believe in it and I feel a complete Right. turd! So Okay. So what happened? But erm it turns out that's what they were. I really a word, and they had a little chat to us. Mm. Well About what? People About the people who are dead? Oh! Oh! About They weren't trying to get you to and, about the you know,th yeah Yeah. Well I because I'm the one who was da doing that because tha I mean I was . But, he was horri the guy that was doing me didn't know he had a pair of a like off er yeah. He was built a bit like Jack. And he had a white T-shirt, pair of jeans, a beer belly and tattoos up his arms. And he was the one Who's the kind of person with ! Exactly! We went into this room and there was this music playing like on the erm like John Indian music. would play on the Oh no. on erm Like in fantasy Yeah. John's sort of thing. You know water a blue light bulb in the middle of the room and I'm thinking, Oh! Come on! What are letting yourself in for? You know. But it was just I mean, the things that they said honestly weird. They're good aren't they? Did I tell you once that a nurse on erm radiotherapy did my psychometry? Yeah. Did I tell you? Yeah. I remember you said. Well this, did I, didn't I tell you? Yeah. Oh sh I've definitely heard this one. What was that? She was holding my fob watch and she said a few things about this, and about us and about dead people and She was closer to you and things like Yeah. that. Yeah. Well this guy, he went Yeah. Oh! the same person was there with exactly the same message. Cos she said what happened was he said Was she fed up? Dunno. He'd already got the message and met someone else ! It's a him. It's a him. They'll not let, let somebody else have a turn ? Well it was, what happened right, I'll tell you the whole story from the very beginning. But basically, the man that, you know, my father said to me well he said to where's the horses? He says I'm getting horses all the time. And of course my Aunty Annie, Gwenny went and he says is it you? I said, well could be. Well, you know He said just everything that was happening, I kept getting horses. And anyway, he said to me he says is there a man in the spirit world close to you? No! So I just thought of my granddad. And I said, yeah, but I was very sort of non-committal Non-committal. Yeah. and very, well I suppose Yeah. kind of Could be. attitude. Could be. Erm, cos I just thought he was guessing, you know, and he said he says, I didn't see him, he said I only saw him and pointed to this girl over the other side of the room he was standing beside you when you were in the chair. Oh no! He says I'll get her to come over and have a chat with you. And she came over after Did she describe him? Aha. So who was it? My dad's granddad. His name Oh no! and everything. His physique, his erm his physical appearance, his character and why he was there and it's exactly what that Merv said off radiotherapy. Mm mm. Why was he there? There's something I've got to do. I need a bit of a push to do it. But there's something that you want to achieve, there's something you've got to do Got to make a jumper. get on and do it. Qualify this. That is exactly what it's not. Yeah. It's your riding. Well that's what everybody says. Yeah. Or it's having a baby. Well I don't think it is. It's probably getting married. It's getting married, yes . I don't think it is. Well what's your main I thi main ambition in life? I think it's to do my riding exams but, I ca as I said, cos Brenda whose horse I ride up at Bridley I was telling her and I said, why would the spirit world get in such a state About riding exam. about me doing riding exams? He said he said which wo what would happen if you got your riding exam when you qualify nursing? I said well I'll probably choose Yeah. riding. I wouldn't know. He said well really for some reason you ought not to be a nurse. I mean, you know how th if you believe in fate and is, is there any control over it or Yeah. is it all planned out for you and Mm. and this kind of thing, is, is someone trying to steer your care or your, the rest Away from of your life? away from something. Which it would be. Away from something. So I don't know, I mean, I'm very open-minded, I mean Oh yeah. but erm he described a, my mum told her everything about a fall the bump on her head, he knew Oh. just loads of things. Very strange. I found that research book. Doesn't Jane look yellow? What? D'ya think Jane looks a bit yellow? I've probably got reflection off her . I know. See if any of us look,ta talking about yellow. Mm. Mm. So? So it was very good. I dunno if I would go to one now. Well I, I want to go now, to er, erm and just try one of the other ones. Tonight I'm gonna go the open circle. I wish I could go. I, I would go, but I'd be frightened to stay there. Well I am whe So am I. see what happened is, I came over and he says, you know I've told this lady that you saw the man standing beside her and she went she sort of, she described him, apparently he was very tall which Yeah. we knew wasn't my granddad cos my granddad was knee high to a grasshopper, erm straight as a dye in character and physical appearance, er like he had a rod up his back which was one of these expressions, Oh! I see. which apparently he was. Obviously I've never met him. I don't think my dad even met him. Yeah. And then she said erm she said, and I suppose she turned to the other guy, she said, we're not supposed to do clairvoyants, like, laughing, you know. And he says, ah, go on it's the end. Cos the all the was over. And then he actually went into a A trance? well not a trance, it was just so normal. She tho she was doing this right as she spoke Like Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost? No! Oh. Dead normal! She, she was going like, you're me and I'm her Ha. and she was standing, I was sitting like, she was standing, she sort of went can you take a Lesley? I went yeah. She says, not in the spirit world. Can you take a what? Lesley. And I said well, yeah and I've got a cousin Lesley . And then nothing more was said about that. And then she was going there's something you need to do. She was literally having a two-way conversation, although, not in an odd way, not going ooh! Ooh! Ooh! You know? She was just like talking to herself, she's going Yeah. and then she would turn her attention back to me. Mm. Oh! How strange! And described him and She thinks she his name. might be going on Wednesday. And Lyndsey might be able to tell you something. Well I know. Well that's what I'm thinking. I'll go, my sister's going with us and I'll, the following Wednesday I'll tell you what it's like. Right. Right. Okay. Come with us. Then we'll go and see the district nurse on Wednesday, is there anything you want me to say? But it's not real But I don't, what if I don't know things? Then I might spend the rest I know. of my thinking I know. It's just that you won't that hasn't happened yet. Well, if you're that sort of person, I would worry about them you see. Now Yeah. someone said to me, I know not, not like an accident or death or anything, but someone said erm you don't have any sisters or something? I would imagine, in my mind, that something's gonna happen to my sisters for her not to be able to see it. I was just thi I remember when I was young I thought my mum went to a fortune teller and, and I had there like tears running Oh! Oh . And she told us we were gonna move to a house with a green door . And did you? My mum bottled out when we got there. Well Bet your there must be a . the thing, the thing that erm worries me is in case I go over is, that you say You're not gonna have any children. you're gonna have two marriages. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's right, you know. Because someone told Tony's mum that Tony would be married twice and the second marriage would be very happy. But then you'd taken that to be that first woman, that Gill person, Gill Yeah Yeah. somebody. Yeah. But that's it. You will really But if they say to me, I'll be marri I'm just gonna be thinking oh my God! But you will relate it, cos no matter what they say you will relate it. Yeah. will be along after this. Keep the noise down thank you. not here. Right. Moving swiftly along er, the little thing on the timetable you know for the the last session where it says quiz it's not really a quiz. It was at the end of the the module. But what we are gonna do is, is give out your study guides and the areas that we'll be revising. We'll do it now. While you're I don't think I'm even gonna bother revising for this. I'm not. Will it be a multiple choice or a written or a Oh yeah. And do I have to ? I think, I think so. A mixture I suppose. Well I can't be A mixture. bothered. Is it serious? Is it like a Serious ? Well it's for yo for your benefit. It's no one 's but . must have all this studying won't they? Don't worry about it.

And certain parts are The false formastation and things. No! That was stupid that! And I got it wrong. You got it wrong? What was that? Blooming stupid question! It was the way it was phrased. Oh, so expulsion of of sperm. And it was, it was something. And it was ejaculation But I thought it was masturbation. Well I thought it was the forced Yeah. Well, it's funny, I was telling Stephen, my boyfriend, about that, and I was telling him the question and he said Yeah. that. Oh. Well Geoff laughed at me when I told him. He said, er bloody typical! Yeah but don't he said . We want a break now. The stupid old bag hasn't looked at it! I've got a headache. That's June . Determined to sort but she's gone now. No, it's not. That's June .

Yes. well he's er, he says he's done a big X-ray. Mm. This is your study guide. Work your way through the guide and you're going to answer all the questions on the quiz. As usual, the papers are taken and they're kept in the file for yo reference by your personal tutors. The reason that we're gonna produce biological science quizzes is they're, it's from your feedback evaluations that you don't get enough biological science. Soon put right. Not a lot more I can say to you is there? Oh I know. Yeah. I never said that. believe it or not. There's about sixty percent I might have said that. of the people who are at the end of a said they didn't get enough. We haven't had enough biological science. So that'll teach us to . didn't want the sixty percent. the little areas as well though. You do need to have a basic knowledge of Yeah. biological science to understand Unfortunately you didn't have to do the . Providing you have . Would you agree? Yeah. Anybody dares Yeah. to disagree? No. Right. Very sensible. Cos Jane doesn't wanna be on the . Now the nasty erm half past seven session sorted out. What can, what can we do for another three hours ?

But usually it finishes within an hour and a half the next session. Which might Right. well finish at five o'clock. Right. Five o'clock. Right. And then i then it's time for a break again.

What she hasn't live with him? Well, she's stayed with him for like weekends, or weeks. Mm mm. She's doing everything that she's going to. I know, but it's a I think it's the family. Mm. I didn't realize her family didn't know mind. You'd think the brother and sister would. Well, I think they do, but they just pretend. Mm mm. The family likes to pretend that they do. Because it's, it's easier, they don't like to to realize these things. I think it's very romantic. The whole thing . Oh I don't think she's saying that. Yeah I know. But you know about, typical woman. families have sex before marriage. Well a how many people though Alison? Not very many. Someone in my hairdressers were talking about it. Sam's cousin, Debbie went out with him for over six years. Well what if you don't like it when you get married? Exactly! . Yeah. That's right. Your wedding night must be such a let down. And that's on your first night! Would be awful! Woo! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Painful. Ooh! Hoo! Hoo! Ooh hoo! It's sore! I know. Real,Real sound effects ! Is that on?

At least your honeymoon can This makes me feel all dead romantic and sexy ! I know. It'll be like It'll be like, don't come near me again! Yeah. Twin beds please. Oh God! So is she quite brainy then? She is isn't she? Yes. She gets really high scores in her exams doesn't she? The kind of thing Denise likes to know about people. I dunno. Well I have to know these things. I know you do dear. I say I'm sure, did she not get the eighty percent in the open book exam? She's got lovely hair! Mm! Got something about her personal appearance as well! She's got nice hair Jan. I think she's got nice hair. Yeah but she does well in her exams so Don't you think these things are important? What that you've got lovely hair? No, that you do well in your exams. No, that you do well in your exams . Denise isn't interested in her hair really. No. She was only saying it as a balance. No. I was gonna ask her where she gets her hair done actually. Well that's right. She's got a bit of money there. She lives down there. By herself? Those with the bay windows? Yeah. Yeah. Tt. Along that row, she's, her dad They're very nice. her mum died of cancer. She lives with Ah! Ah! her dad. Mm. How old is she? And she got a younger sister. Twenty. Oh! Oh!there. I says to her, you bloody well do that then! Can you take the ? Four hour . Beg your pardon? Er, shut up! Don't forget you said this is still . I didn't say that. Yes you are. They will tell you. What? And then we won't know when we go. I'm getting a bit spooked about this exam now. I am. I keep suddenly thinking of the enormity of it. And th the fact that I haven't really revised. At least you, you are in the same place. I keep thi I keep sitting down to it and thinking God! There's so much I haven't done for this exam. As usual, I should have started ages ago. But I found when I looked at my books a week ago, or a fortnight ago, I thought, oh I know this, I know this, but it's not until you get into it that you think shit! I don't know this and I could be learning. A week ago I didn't know what to learn and now there's so many things that I know I want to learn. Mm mm. Well every time, every time we come in and she mentions, have you done this, that Yeah. and I think Can I have one of them things? I know. You. You. What? Fizzy gum balls. Oh. She always does. Get one of them I'll get one It's only funny when Pardon you! Thi a I have to say that she does it all the time and she goes, looks around. Does it . A girl I used to work with at the Beechams did like really big burps. I'd say she ate about anything and like pardon me. She would . My grandma's like that. Horrible! I mean she wo she says pardon me or excuse me, but it's so matter of fact that I'd be I could never burp like that if I tried, you know. She did a big, I went in the kitchen at at work on Friday and Saturday What time, what time have we gotta, do we have to be back? Twenty past. And the, the chef's were squeezing the custard carton and it was going cos it was the last and the Custard? You mean they don't make their own custard? Nah! They don't make anything man. Tt! And they were squeezing it out of the carton and it was making this right farty noise. I'm not kidding, the three of them,thir thirty odd year old one of them is, they were on the Well I've been floor laughing! One was going, the other ha ha ha! The custard's going My dad's forty And I'm thinking three and he still How old? does things Do you not like that though. do you not laugh when a squeezy bottle does it? No. Oh! I think it's so funny ! I mean, it's funny like when you burp because you get, embarrass you like. Oh no, it makes me laugh. And there's loads of people round about me and I just went wurgh! And I'd like to be fined . I hate people that erm when my dad burps, if, if it was a cup he'd go excuse me, but but it's when they go I hate that! I do. Cos I don't. I'll conceal a burp, no matter where I am. Well you don't obviously ! Well that er popping out. someone really. You could tell I didn't know it was coming. You can tell it was but make Geoff makes him burp. Oh no! I don't. Cos he feels he's got a wind so he Oh I can't force myself. Nor can I. Aargh. What was that? Oh. When's Tony coming for you tonight? I said half past seven. If we finish before then I shall be very annoyed! They said eight o'clock, quarter to. Quarter to eight cos they started at quarter to six. I could just sleep. Just feel like I'm not learning anything . I know. But then the thing is, Exactly. so I'm not learning anything and then we're to . What have I done all day? I know what . in the past two days. It's like what I said to Tony last night when I got in I said, I feel I could have achieved more if I'd stayed at home and revised. Yeah! I could of. He said but,yo you wouldn't of. I said well I would of that's the whole point. I would have revised all afternoon. I know. Anne was saying when Anne she was revising I've never seen No that was right. The whole . . Sorry I didn't offer anybody cos No that's alright. Oh. And I, when she's revising she says oh I've just done about change and theories of change. Who? Theories of change. But we started with Fred and only got Have you remembered that? a third of a ye way through it. Change in the N H S. Change, do you know what change she's talking about? Freezing, something when er a liquid is freezing and it changes when it is you know changes in the physical sense of the Yeah. word. That's what they learn about. I said oh that's what I've got then. Cos I'm talking about change in the N H S is all we can put down. Here's Anne. But then it's just how bad it. Oh! I wish we'd just done that . It's so, simplified. So basic, so logic. I mean, what do we need about planning something? We don't need it. I mean, I didn't understand much to be honest anyway. I wasn't listening cos I was writing them down. The thing is, with this I don't think half the people listen to you're meant to know you're meant to, in these exams you're meant to have everything you should know and everything else That's it. I'm sitting writing notes and I'm thinking am I ever gonna look at these again? Cos every time I have an exam it's a exactly the same things. I have got revision cards coming out of my ears! And erm which I'll never look at again at all. We're all looking very sorry for ourselves. Well what relevance is it to me? Is not I know. I'm not gonna be a nurse anyway. And I'm gonna go away next, next weekend aren't I? Tony said I need to do some exercise late at night. Cos I annoy him. Because as soon as I go upstairs I'm wide awake. Mm mm. He says you should go, go jogging or something late at night. I said well if you got us a dog I'd have to take it for a late night walk wouldn't I? Come jogging with me. Do you fancy coming jogging? What? Last thing at night? Yeah. You go first thing in the morning. I know but I can go at night as well. No, what, do you play squash? What like eleven o'clock? I don't, I've never played it but I'd certainly like to but I wanna play again. I play Mm. He says it's very unusual, you never see me like this . Ooh! I quite fancy doing that. We should have done. You know I was thinking today I was thinking today erm there's a horse Sorry. Say that again. there's a horse erm in some of the fields just coming out of Morpeth towards Newcastle and I saw, pardon me as I was on the bus like yesterday coming into Morpeth and this horse just shot out of nowhere and it was really enjoying itself! It was like galloping along ! as if it was racing. Yeah. Yeah! It was just like this ! And then it thing and it came, it was really galloping towards the fence and then, cor! Right up Yeah. to the fence. It stuck a All of a sudden. And I was looking, I was thinking, oh! To be free like that. Mm. And then today when I was passing it was just munching away in the corner, you know. And I was thinking, tt, it must nice, Alison's got a hobby she can just go out and you know, do it to get away Shall I tell you what it is, sometimes from everything. I go back from , I'm driving over to Brenda's and I'm thinking,, and I really am, I'm driving along, you know like wha when you're in the car by yourself and everything's turning over in your head Mm. and go and I tack up the horse and I get on the horse and everything and I don't mean to say Falls away. I'm drifting through the countryside cos No. it might be and I'll go over the level crossing I'll think, ooh that was a bit you know, things like that and then we'll see another horse in the field and Canter goes, ooh ooh it's all so everything Mm. it's, it's, it's on a different level, it really is. And because you could, you could just like ride away and not come back ever. Even when you come back you feel much better. You feel, oh I really enjoyed that. And it's a different kind of enjoyment, but, I mean I've never played squash Do you feel like that when you run? Well, well it must be the same. Or like when I, if I we say maybe, now I can't imagine feeling like that except with horse riding, but I suppose you do, whatever your thing is. That's it. It is. Er I wish I had a hobby or a outside interest. It has to be outside I think. Definitely. Yeah. Outside outside. That's it. I suppose Suppose like the riding. everyone feels like that. I think I would, I think I feel like that everything will still be there while I was riding along. Oh! I have to stop and think about it, but I You know what your natural endorphin would come to the surface and you just start getting the feeling of well-being. Well that's the thing like, it's You come to solutions and conclusions and everything's right with the world. And we'd better go back now. If you twitched a horses lip or ear that happens, I would really like to see if I twitched your ear. And can we get a Well Yeah. Mm. It brings their endorphin to the . Did you see The World According to Garth? No. On Sunday. Well I saw a little bit of it, if I wo I keep wanting to see this film Mm. and I've never actually seen it. If you know what I mean? And erm oh just put them on that table over there. No I don't wanna get back there, I don't wanna go back up to the wards so I'll go that way or that way? That way. That way? Thanks. Yeah. I've forgotten which way I come in. It's easily done. Bye. And erm he's, he's got these papers like with short stories Mm. and the wind blows them away out of his hand, so erm Shit! Oh shit! you're meant to get them in the bin not out of the bin. And th he's picking them all up and this one there's a like a rockwe erm, doberman pinscher standing and these papers between his legs . urgh! Urgh! Like this, and he's saying, Bonkers, now give me that paper! Give me that paper! The dog just leaps on him right,so he's wrestling this dog, and he's screaming and the dog going, growling at him and everything Aha. and then suddenly you hear the dog goes running off and he's bit its ear! So he goes to see his mother who's a nurse at the Aha. school where he lives, cos she's the nurse, like a matron, and er she said Garth! What's this? Was it its ear ? The dog's ear . It's a little triangle of the dog ! Oh no! I mean it was cruel Oh my God! but it was funny cos he just aargh! Like this . Ah ah ah! The dog went off yelping. Bless its little cotton socks. Bet that didn't release its natural endorphin. Ah Ah. We'll have a slow mosey. Mhm. I find, tell you what I find difficult is thinking and learning in that class. Mm. Some of the people aren't conducive to learning. I know. I know. And I try not to get stroppy, I try to be you know, otherwise I'm being a complete crab and not joining in, but Mhm. I've found I have to have a lot of conditions. Everything has to be just so for me to be able to learn. It has to be right. I mean half the time I think I don't remember anything because er er, people are so busy blooming playing around and Mhm. shouting and And I'm too nosey to block things out. and When I was sitting in that corridor there was one of the tutors on the phone, only for a short while and I couldn't even blot him out cos I was too nosey to listen to what he was talking about. I don't think it's deliberate. But I'm No. I'm reading Just curious. I'm aware of it. Naturally curious. I can't revise when I know that Geoff's in. If he is, I go upstairs to be by myself. The telly has to be off. Well you see I have to have the telly very quiet and last night, ah! To I'm sure he's going deaf you know. Mm mm. And I, I keep going down and I'll turn it down, and then I'll go out room and he turns it back up again. It's like living with a cantankerous old man ! It's enough to make you deaf. What? Well the sound quality's not very good. I says, well I can hear it upstairs! He says well you're The trouble is you're just over-sensitive! what you can hear upstairs is going, ooh ooh, ooh ooh! Oh! Ooh ooh! And the music! Yeah. The theme tunes that are on. Oh ! Dear me! I wish it was that. Well I'll go and get two, three. I'll soon get Oh yeah. Yeah. Well that's your fault. I was saying I thought she was lovely! Yeah. Exclusive to Mm mm. Mm mm. Yeah. It's nearly time for Neil. I'm cold now. It's cold in here. The nights are drawing in. Impact and intervention A ball? bodily functions . The Newcastle College of Health Studies Ball . Yeah? Erm, yes. Twenty pound a ticket! That's what it was last time wasn't it? Meal, disco and band. Well, can I tell you the first one we went to we went to get food and there was none left! Well that'll be on the . And there was a lovely spread! But by the time we got there, and there was and there was people there I've never even seen before in my life! I suppose this one's it's cheap. That was, it's always the one beside the Civic Centre one? Yeah. The one you went to when I was ill? It's good like. Yeah. If you can get in. It was me and Clare dancing on the table there. difficult to get in. At least it was just us and we were gonna Well have you seen Helen's video? No. No. Nobody has. Oh! It's brilliant. Have you,can I ask, have you got pink in your hair? Yeah, I've I sprayed it pink for the Rocky Horror and I can't get it out! I was, I keep looking and I'm thinking Is it pink? it's the light. It's the light. It's still a bit pinky. Just a little bit. Was it good? The Rocky Horror? It was brilliant! Eh! It took four shampoos to, to get the bugger out! I thought it was my eyesight. No. No. I love the Rocky Horror Show! Anyway, she's got the erm video right Mm. and there's a bit with Helen and Steve and you know what Helen was like when they was Steve? drunk. Big Steve. And sh Oh! Right. they showed it to, to me. It was her face! And, and Ellen was gonna bring it into college but ca er Helen said don't you dare! So she's, she's Yeah. cut out that bit. That bit. Ellen cut it off. Oh! Oh! Yeah. Cut it? Yeah. So, it was ever so bad apparently ! It was really good. Everyone was on it. Everyone was having a good time. It was really good. Well th maybe I should look at it seeing as I missed it. I can just remember Helen's bum! You were in hospital. That's all I saw all night! Denise. What on? That do at Aye. I just remember her backside wherever I saw always Helen's backside. I think they should have another one. Seeing as I missed it. Yeah. Yeah. And come back with Mark . I spent my whole night following him around! Following him round. And you, and with Steve, Ellen can pick it out. Oh have you? Well you shouldn't have cos we wanted to see I've seen it and, and it was the best the best time I had was . It was good. Right. Am I telling you about this? Yeah. Sorry. Have I made much sense so far? Yeah. Yeah, but I the man Can I the patient looks outside in and carer looks inside out. Inside out. Right. And here's, here's his journey right. G P appointment, outpatient appointment, tests, admission, medical treatment, nursing care,planning and follow-up. And that's the patient from his journey out? That's his journey right? Here, he's looking in how he came, where is it? Route. Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba But is it the round window, the square window, or the arched window? There's one. Da, da, dee dee dee. Right, it says here,quality can only be asse assured ,pa beg your pardon,if both patient's view, he's looking in there. Right. in, and the care-givers view looking out are in agreement . Right. What if they're not? What To a is the one that we're actually doing? Yeah. That's right. To achieve this quality assurance should mean, that when the patient feels his care is not good he should know how he can complain without any worry that he will be penalized, and in the certainty that action will be taken immediately . And that's these things here. There's patient questionnaires, complaints, da da, er ba la visitor inspections, complaints, patient questionnaire, there's a basically all the same kind of thing, or relative survey. Patient questionnaire. So, basically, what they're saying there's all these things that they'll provide at each stage of his journey so that if care isn't right he knows what channels to go through to complain. My criticism of that being is But what if it's not carried out? it's, it's al the quality's not there to start with. How can you He da he won't know what, what quality of care is though. Well er, the patient has his views about what Yeah. he expects, good nursing care But his views aren't really gonna be necessarily good nursing care cos a lot of people wouldn't know No, everybody's individual. And to get, what it says here, to get quality assurance, the patient's views, and the care-giver's views have to be in agreement. What, say you're the care-giver and I'm the Yeah. patient what I think is good nursing care might not be what you think is good nursing care. But what you know is not gonna be the same. It has to be the same for quality assurance. But it's not gonna be the same. But that will Yeah cos you I tell you what I think It says on our research thing say that, say that erm . Say that Er, say yes to that one. I shan't ask anything. But will it tell me the truth? Well, see, for one is she's not erm as bad as that. You know, some patients I could think of seem to have the idea that everything should be done for them in hospital Mm. and that to them is good care if a nurse does everything for them, but it's not. If, you're taking all Yeah. Mm. And when he goes into Plus they also say that a nurse is always busy and they're angels, and they're, that and the other, that they won't complain. Well that's the only way that this can be assessed, is by, so that the patient blah blah la when a patient feels his care is not good he knows he can complain without any worry . But complaining, I mean, if he's gotta complain it means that quality assurance isn't there. But This is only thing if they've got something to complain about. if you were the patient nurse So there's nothing to actually say In a positive sense? Yeah. Yeah. The only thing that So if it says Yeah. erm meaning ha blah blah and action taken . It should also mean that when Mr , that's it, says the nurses were marvellous, the nurses are able to say in all evidence, and with evidence to support their opinion, yes We were crap! we are really doing a pretty good job. That's all it says in a positi from a positive angle. Yeah but A pretty good job. So what do you think ? But like, if you take like like er,le let me, if you were the patient and Lesley was the nurse and also your own reports erm there's the one about designation of assets you know, which I think was a very good recommendation of yours. I think the actuarial responsibilities and the wider role of actuaries was important. I think the inde independent corroboration for actuaries was another important factor, custody confirmation by the auditors, veto of transfer of assets, independent auditors for pension funds, independent custodian arrangements, in-house investment management, you made some comments, co-ordination or the various regulators, co-ordination of the professional advisors, establishment of a pension tribunal, you know, now as far as I was concerned or on my sort of looking through it, those were all recommendations that, that you've made over your two years and I couldn't really find any response to those in Good and I think that's a you know we, we personally found that disappointing. Also I mean, we take your point and we've made it before Ken that there's a real danger of asking for a report from someone like Professor Gower and then cherry picking it, instead of actually taking the whole, because it does actually add together in some sort of coherence erm and had Professor Gower's report been accepted in its entirety, we may not have been had the pleasure of having you back again today, but thank you very much er all three of you for coming. Thank you very much. I would suggest is the timescale between these things happening and it getting to the regulator and being digested. In the present didn't understand for two years I mean told the regulator Yes, yes er whereas if there were independent trustees responsible to the regulator and they were properly trained, they would I suggest be able to smell out very quickly an malpractice and would have a group straight to the regulator, if only to call a stop for someone to have a look at it. nothing recommended to Goodey in that particular cause is of any good. I don't think so. Erm er Imperial? I M P A Cs belief is that er if you get the trustee balance right, that's the first place where the decision ought to be made, but there should be a fall back position which Good has given, which they they trustees could go to the regulator in the case of er not being able to solve things, but our feeling very much on surplus is that the money is there first for to pay pensions and until pensions are paid up to Inland Revenue levels whatever they are, then no money should go back to the company. The question of taking pension holidays in between out of surplus is a sort of mid midway position, but er very definitely we feel strongly that money should not go back to the company. We have suffered from the same thing as the other two er Abalance have said today of money being used from our surplus to provide for redundancy and erm it's been exacerbated by money being available from the people who were made, made redundant going to the company and swelling their balance sheets while all the cost side of it comes out of the pension fund and that has caused a lot of ill-feeling particularly from the older pensioners who have seen years of inflation, when their pensions were not made up to the same extent. In the old days when there was a possibility of of erm ad hoc payments made er that sort of thing was taken care of, since the takeover of the company that hasn't happened to the same extent, so there's a very strong feeling with the older pay er pensioners that they paid money into a pension scheme which now shows a surplus, but other people are benefiting from it. We need we've got lots more questions to ask you. Peter? Erm Mrs Appleby you mentioned briefly earlier the role of the regulator. How do you see the regulator doing his job with a hundred and twenty-eight thousand schemes to, to monitor? Great difficulty I would imagine. erm er well we welcome the erm er the proposal that there should be a regulator. Somebody er to whom the erm er matters could be referred to er whom er could remove trustees er who are er not acting in er the best interests er of the fund er to whom er I understand that the erm beneficiaries could er appeal if they felt that their fund was being erm used i in the wrong way, which is something that we haven't got at the moment. Erm I mean just going very, very briefly back to the question that you asked erm about this how would you stop what's happen happening is by having, we would have thought a pensioner trustee, because even the question has been asked how did it get through the union trustees, and the answer that most of them are employed and they are looking over their shoulder because jobs are going, redundancies are being made, you've got a pensioner employee er a pensioner trustee on there, and they're not looking over their shoulder for their job, they are going to do the job of a trustee and watch the fund and they would then be able to go to the regulator if they saw something that was amiss, but if somebody is employed by the firm might be very worried about doing because they're more bothered about keeping their job. Though, the case you're putting that the, the pensioner trustee er ship is more powerful than you originally put, cos up to now you've been put it in grounds that it's the trust should be repr representative of it Yes Now you're saying er rather well, that in fact that person or persons could be more independent Yes. because they're actually not worried about being sacked Yes. either erm because redundancies are coming or as Imperial Trustees found, they were just got ridden of as a way of moving them off the trust. Yeah, very good. large carrots being dangled in front of them. I mean we ought to say in our case approved our the proposals of the company, they raise no objections in which only the who raised objections, the employees didn't and in the High Court case we've just said, how can an employee be independent, when he depends upon his employer for his future work. So really what you're saying is that if we're looking at trip wires to stop things happening, there's a power a really powerful case for a pensioner trustee, but you're looking for whistle blowers. Yes. There's also a powerful case for having pensioner trustees that they will so there's far less chance of erm people twisting their arm, although they could have the carrot dangled in front of them. that's But that's the problem we all face isn't it. And we're also saying that if you have a new pensions act, the work of the regulator will be much easier. Why? You won't keep have to be going off to court to find out what is the law at that moment of time. Touche. Could I, could I turn to one of the major contributors of erm of pension fund surpluses er and that is the plight of the deferred pensioner. The person who leaves the company's employment er could I ask you, each of you in turn briefly for some comments about how you feel deferred pension rights can best be preserved, if they can be preserved at all er adequately. I suppose in one way as a pensioner I shall say what happens about you know I'm not worried about if you're a pensioner because every time one someone becomes a deferred pensioner, our surplus goes up Yes. because the liability is extinguished. Yes. I cannot see why the actuary having a liability for an employee, if that employee becomes a deferred pensioner that the actuary having a liability for the fund But don't Yes they are Can I, you the example you did before to other people was that if you worked you know your normal scheme forty years and if you worked for ten of those forty years you become deferred. Do you have a quarter of the right you would expect if you done the forty years. Is that the sort of way one should underwrite the position as a deferred pensioner Yes Yes What I think my colleague is saying is that when the actuary is assessing the commitments of the funds, he is looking at the anticipated increased earnings until the person retires and I think when the calculation is made for somebody who is er a deferred pensioner of leaving er a pension fund to take his money elsewhere a similar calculation or the same calculation should be used, the one that the actuary last used in, in looking forward and saying what the commitments are. That way the fi the surpluses left behind would be less, but the person transferring and we're going to see more and more of this today er takes a fair amount of money with him. But of course if salaries go up evenly throughout a forty year lifespan and the Chairman is given a forty year lifespan which is quite or pension lifespan which is quite a suitable one, if salaries go up and someone leaves their company every ten years, then the first three departures are obviously going to be at much lower salary levels and it's not going to be satisfactory the first three departures are just index linked to inflation, there is the problem of how does one index link them towards the final salary. Otherwise that person having worked for four different employers during the forty years will not retire on two-thirds of final salary, but will retire on two-thirds er only perhaps the last employer for the last ten years. It isn't a question Chairman but it's easy to ask as it seems,we you said a ten year, but what about a thirty service of deferred pension, that could be an entirely different situation, because that is inflation put under the Post Office and B T ones it's inflation proofed every year, so for the ten years, if he's if he's got another ten years before he draws his pension at sixty, he would have that er deferred pension inflation proofed every year. So a thirty year old service might be entirely different than a person with ten years service deferring his pension. Yes, the reason why we picked a forty year lifespan of work or working life er with four tens was because Professor Good himself told us that er on their research the common employment pattern today is in fact four employers over the working life and of course that is very different from the experience of many pensioners who are drawing today from their pension funds, because many of them were long-term, long-service employees throughout their lives with one employer. But you were saying weren't you you described this world which lots of us now have lost and somebody leaving school starting a job and retiring from that job, so the que the question David's asked you is more important isn't it because deferred pensions are probably gonna become more, not less common. They are becoming a lot more common, yes when you look in the report and accounts there are far, far more of these deferred pensioners there than er than ever used to exist and it's something which I must admit we haven't given a lot of thought to yet, but it's something because it's growing that we will have to address erm in our federation, we will have to address that problem. And the danger presumably is that the surpluses we were having our discussion and debate about earlier on, those surpluses that and I do understand why you feel the pensioners should benefit from their surplus, but it the reality is that the employers and possibly the pensioners are currently arguing amongst themselves for the benefit of those surpluses, but in fact one of the significant contributors is often the deferred pensioners Yes. and the deferred pensioners are not actually getting in on the debate, they're not often represented on the trustees in fact. No, they're n they're not represented, erm but I think we would b you know, I mean I think they, they should get be considered certainly erm dependent upon the length of service which they have put in it's certainly something for the future. I was gonna make a point about the one you raised the practicalities of the situation. I don't know enough actuarial work to be able to and what settlements they should receive, but our own experience is that it's hard enough to round up pensioners to form an association and we embody deferred pensioners and they're even harder. We just don't seem to be able to track them down or attract them in quite the same way, so there is a massive practical problem if you want them to have a voice in how things are done, there's no doubt about that. We have that same problem, but er it can be solved quite easily, the employer knows the addresses of pensioners, there's nothing to stop pensioner association being formed. We are unable to get addresses of our so it's word of mouth how we, how we er include, but why should not the employer send to all pensioners and deferred pensioners notices about the associations. Could I ask you very quickly on that note, do you think the answer is to try and set up a voting mechanism amongst the deferred pensioners, or is the answer that one should actually appoint a professional independent trustee, specifically with the duties of looking after the deferred pensioners in the debates that you have identified often take place? We were told that that is impossible to take a vote because with big organisations like B T and the Post Office one example was to sell off a Girobank there are eight thousand people, but they were just told you can either defer your pension, leave it with the Post Office Pension Fund, transfer it to the Leicester and Alliance who bought Girobank, or take your money out and take up a personal pension scheme. They were given no votes or erm opportunities and of course the same thing will happen if and when the Parcelforce is sold off from the Post Office er there's twenty thousand people there. I doubt very much whether they'll be given any opportunity to voice what happens to them when they're transferred or what happens to the fund. They'll be given the same three options I should imagine. So you would feel probably the best mechanism would be the appointment of somebody who is given that responsibility and solely that responsibility of reporting and looking after the interest of the deferred pensioners. Yes. You would agree with that? Yes I would agree, would favour that because I think it would force another issue, if, if the independent rule too often against the deferred pensioners I suspect they'd organise themselves. You see in British Steel we we have seventy thousand deferred pensioners and er it is a group of people that I feel extremely sorry for, because er in nineteen eighty-six British Steel introduced into their pension scheme while it was still in the public sector, retirement at sixty where with a pension credit spaced on length of service, so if you had thirty-five years service in, you could retire at sixty as if you were sixty-five and there was nothing done at all for deferred pensioners and in certainly our submission to British Steel for seeking improvements, we we asked that they er they look at deferred pensioner with a view to paying their pensions at sixty, recognising that it was a very high-class plane that might have to be er achieved in stages. We also recognise that there is a tremendous problem for deferred pensioners in achieving reasonable transfer values er er er it's a massive problem for them, even where they could find perhaps something to do with that money and a scheme that would do them better, not always, because there, there are people that give bad advice, but there are some that go into it very thoroughly and when it comes down to the bit the transfer value they receive makes it im practically impossible for them to do it. But we've got So we would like er to support what you're saying. We've got six more minutes, David? Er shall I combine my two found questions which the Committee would like to put to you please and, and that is there are two points that really do come out of Maxwell very much, but I think you've had some experience. One is bulk transfers and the second is safeguarding of assets. Er in the context of bulk transfers would you like to comment on the Good Committees conclusions on the bulk transfers of members between schemes and how they operate, and do you think that er there is widespread abuse or do you think er on balance your experience has been that where bulk transfers have taken place, they have taken place responsibly, but I would in that context ask you to comment whether there has been an unreasonable time delay where you have experienced bank bulk transfers between the transfer actually taking place in terms of employees being transferred from an undertaking to another undertaking and the actual transfer of their pension funds. What happened in Maxwell's case was that enormous delays took place between the employees being transferred and the actual transfer of their pension. Er and could you also comment perhaps on the safeguarding of assets and any er points you would like to make in relation to the present five per cent limit on self investment. The er issue of stock lending if you heard the Maxwell pensions earlier on comment on stock lending, whether you think pension funds should do that er in the case of Maxwell as you're probably aware a lot of the stock lending was off market rather than on the market and perhaps you could also comment on the use of independent custodians in terms of the custody of investment. Er I'm sorry to throw all those at you very quickly, but they are er obviously five minutes left and B T th the question about bulk transfers. Sorry no not, British Steel, apologies. Well, I, I'd say one thing by illustration from our own situation er we were transferring bulk and I felt that was singularly unfair because the members were given a choice. The existing members were told you can either join the new scheme with its improved benefits, reduced contributions, with certain rules that were operating in favour of the employer that were against them, but it was a balancing act, or if you don't want that you can stay with the old scheme and continue with exactly the same terms. The third choice was the obvious one you can take your money and get out. Er now we, the pensioners, had no choice, we were picked up and put into the new scheme having paid our contributions appropriately to the old scheme rules which were the higher contributions, but only to pick up the new scheme rules that were against our interest. Now I can see no good reason for that being allowable, I'm not quite sure how you stop it, but I think it it's, it's a basic problem with bulk transfer, the individuals do not have a say. Very good. B T? Well I've already said about the bulk transfer Giro, I quite honestly don't know whether any other option can be given to people, they've given the option to defer their pension with the Post or their present scheme, transferred it new company scheme or take out er the money and take out a personal pension fund er I suppose there might be a possibility of offering people after a certain number past a certain number of years the opportunity to remain within the fund they're in but er the contribution and who, who makes a contribution may be a problem, but that's the only other option I can see. We don't believe that pensioners ought to be forcibly transferred, they should be given the choice. And if that was in the Statute, there would could stop the Indeed, yes. Can we then go back to the other one on safeguarding. Very difficult indeed er hearing the Maxwell people talking earlier I think er again and made that point very clear. I think we can point to some of the things that can happen that worry us. Er if you stand back from our situation and see it that er the contribution rate for employees was reduced from sixty five per cent for er a company i it became a balance of cost and that works out now at five per cent, so the total inputs of the scheme is ten per cent of earnings and that was down from eighteen per cent . Er without being an actuary I say to myself that's a pretty magical thing you've done and then it causes you to start looking at the monetary background of all of that an and again I I'm, I'm speaking here largely on what actuarial advice we are beginning to receive. I think the conclusion coming out of that is that as a result of what I've described and a few other things as well, not least the fact that the company has now capped its contribution rate to no more than ten per cent . When it gets to ten, the members stay at five when the company gets to ten, the damage is picked up by either reducing members benefits or restricted index linking. Now with a hundred and eighty thousand of pensioners and forty thousand scheme members and all of the trustees currently made up of employees and scheme members, it's pretty obvious where any correction of loss of funding is gonna come from isn't it. There can only be one target, it's the pensioners. So er when schemes by the good service of actuaries can be re-written in such extreme terms I begin to worry about it and I think it needs an input for more than one direction on the actuarial fund in our case the trustees saw fit not to use actuaries to get away But on actual safeguarding of assets, erm do you for instance with separate custodians, do you have any views about the custody of your schemes assets? Not, no, I, I've really not given thought to that subject. B T, anything? Well I was impressed by the erm the Maxwell erm peoples comments that the funds should be clearly marked pension fund accounts and and that er there would be regulations that this money couldn't be transferred without some the regulator again or somebody making er agreeing to the transaction, but I erm fully understand that would be erm very time-consuming, but er that's the only way I can see that, that the fund should be clearly marked that they're pension fund and shouldn't be transferred without some some authority agreeing to it. We have separate custodians, the Bank of Scotland are doing this and er I think er having a separate organisation outside is er an important first step, but you've then got to tie up who gives them instructions and that obviously needs careful thought, needs to be done through the trustees. just one question that I wasn't able to put on the Committee's behalf, but I think it is something that we would be very grateful for a short written comment and that is the information that your members, that the members of the pension funds actually er rather than your annual members as well in that context actually receive annually and whether you feel that is satisfactory. We can send you that. Yes, I think also how you feel it could be improved would be very relevant and how you would feel in the context of a pensioners meeting, an annual meeting like shareholders have in companies and how you if you have any views on how such a meeting might be managed in relation to the deferred pensioners interests, the existing pensioners interests, the employees interest and obviously the company's interest being adequately reflected at such a meeting but I think we would welcome that aspect. And also efforts you've made to organise yourself as groups and whether you've been encouraged or not encouraged by the owners of the scheme. Thank you. That would be very helpful. Can I thank you for coming today,th th the media often has lots of comments from the chattering classes, saying unhealthy, British democracies, cos they only concentrate on this place. I, I'm not gonna comment whether I think that's right or not, but anyone viewing your contribution today would know that outside there in the big institutions of our society democracy is very healthy. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you. Thank you. We thank you. Clearly one of the issues we've got though, is t we're looking at something like million pound overspend in C I S for the calendar year ninety three which we've gotta try and pull back, at least some of that. We worked out yesterday that probably the overspend in er client services could be between a hundred and eighty two thousand and half a million, not four hundred depending on which scenario you take. Erm the worst scenario takes into account things like erm whacking in another two people in claims, another four in E W S erm i if you go along with the the current situation on volume increases erm and er the simple choice on those is you either pay pay to cover the service levels or you let the service level deteriorate. Mm. Erm but I mean that's forecast for erm more or less now if the volumes stay as they are, so that's an issue. Erm we've also got an issue with erm the post cock-up and that's a technical term you're laughing at are you? Erm cock-up two people to go to John , erm because erm, apart from anything else it was agreed John 's arm was twisted yesterday to take two people and g and the work but the issue is is that the K doesn't, the issue is is that there is no budget anywhere for it either here or down in John's area. And the reason being is that somebody thought that John was taking the work without having to take people, which he can't do. So John's now taking it on the basis that he takes budget with it so So they are going? Yes they will be going. Ah I mean right Mary'll take them all now Yeah, unfortunately erm Does that mean Richard as well from upstairs or Russell, whatever his name is? Russell Russell Ah I don't know if Russell's going, I mean that's something for them to sort out upstairs. Yeah th they were the two people, it's our two part-timers plus Russell. Oh well that's what it is then, yeah. Yeah okay. But you'll need to sort that out with Mary when she's back, she's not back till after Easter anyway. So when's that happening? Well I'll leave that problem for Mary to sort out. But it, we don't save any money from doing that now anyway. In fact we lose money either way. Erm so that's,tha that that's now been done. Erm now potentially, if you totted up, and there's also the data integrity the other reports, which is the sixty K overspend we talked about, now the question is do we spend that, do we spend that this year, what do we do? Now Sorry what reports are they? Well Phil knows what they are. Well we've we're gonna spend it now anyway. No I mean I've started giving reports out to the sections already Yeah I, I know but Is that units? Units reports? Yeah Yeah. on the data correction exercise. Yeah. Oh But the, the question is until you've fixed them they'll stay in in exclusion right? Yeah. Right, so you fix them just as quickly as you can fix them, but if that takes nine months it takes nine months, that's one of the views you can take on it. Yeah. Erm the issue is is that potentially you could be goi we could've been going for four point three extra people and we probably won't do that. But the ne the ne the other issue is that erm on the Jason front, the overspend on the salary, we might well be able to adjust that down in terms of the overall salary review absorb it within that in July. Five grand across the whole we'll, we'll lose it somewhere. Oh what, the k the difference between him being an A and, and the budget being a C? Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Erm on the other side there are some definite overspends which we've got to do some more work on. Erm there's the P W P five year thing which, which we've got to erm cover for which we've covered as two F T E for the six months and then we'll need to review that after that. Erm we've got the same sort of issue with excess relief. And then there's the, the data integrity on units which is the fourteen we've already made some er nominal provision for which is Mhm quote ten quotes people moving across. Erm, in addition to that there's the erm there's the U A three stuff in the first half of this year which is fourteen people for four months, eight people for two months effectively. Erm then there's billing and collection pensions conversion, regionalization all coming in late. Erm now the impact of those is twofold, one is that we've got the overspend on the data integrity and the U A three, cos it wasn't in the budget at all. And secondly the fact that it wasn't in the budget erm and the fact that they're late means that we're not also realizing the productivity in other areas that we had anticipated so we're gonna be some six months late coming in. Now the potential overspend on the definite ones, the ones I just read out, is two hundred and eighteen thousand. But we reckon that in actual fact if you erm don't do the we just dis discount the billing and collection and the pensions conversions and so on that we will actually get some benefits from the, the, the things that we've already put in place this year, we reckon we can reduce that overspend on that side of it down to about a hundred and eighty two thousand erm because it's, it's nominal paper er transactions in a way. Erm so really the issue is we haven't made any decisions yet, these are the things we've gotta try and make decisions on, but we will need to be starting to think them before we get to June. One of the major problems we've got is that erm the w I did some figures yesterday that, that tended to suggest that in fact our productivity performance overall is about two point seven at the moment even without having had in and without having units in and so on, so we have increased our productivity, marginally, despite the fact we've got temps in and we've got those new business people. Erm Wasn't it in the budget the two point seven for the first two months? Yeah but it's now gone up to two point And increases eight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Erm but the reality is that erm we would therefore need our budget to, in fact for the first half of this year, to have, well for the whole year, to have reflected the late delivery of the systems which would've, if we'd had that in the budget and we'd been projecting the whole budget at say two point six, our budget figure would've been somewhere in the region of another eighty to ninety thousand higher than it currently is for this first quarter. Erm so in actual fact we'd've been there or thereabouts had we not made the budget assumptions that we did. Now one of the major issues that we're concerned about of course is the overtime erm which is, if you review the last three months of the overtime which we did the other day, erm we obviously, we spent the annual budget erm allowance. One of the things that we need to, to work out, and Mark 's gonna do some work on that and, and Maureen pro primarily to identify that erm we're spending about thirty five, thirty six K a month over at the moment. Erm now there's two questions really, one is is that partly to offset the erm lack of productivity that we had anticipated in the budget. So in other words is our F T E consistent with where we actually are rather than where we thought we'd be erm or have we got erm you know er the Parkinson's law, been operating with the, the overtime, people are used to doing it and therefore they keep doing it and so on. One of the other impacts we need to work out in fact is the er effect of the overtime as being worked in quotes, by all the quotes people not just the temps, because that's gonna be a significant chunk. If those, all of those contract temps are regarded as full time people it looks like full time people are working overtime, which is why I asked you the question yesterday erm what's the overtime bill for quotes alone. Cos we've got a hundred percent hundred percent increase in volume Yeah in quotes. And th th the contract people, if they are working overtime, are, are paid the, the premium rates Oh right yeah Yeah. So it's, it's costing us Yes it is costing us, yeah. time and a half. But the point is is that for everybody else there was, there is some assumption that we'd be working off of post driven erm response, okay? So if you got more post in, or your productivity in the servicing sections is down, from two point seven it's down actually at two point six is what we're achieving, we're marginally out. But the, every hour of overtime worked in quotes is in fact an hour actually on our budget, it isn't just a pr proportion of it on our budget which is what you've got everywhere else. So No it's not entirely true cos we did have a budget for overtime Yeah but i if you're gonna go over by a hundred percent and you've got people there working overtime Yeah. significantly every hour that they do on that is gonna be signific is, is not budgeted for cos you've got fourteen people there who weren't budgeted for at all. Yeah. So when you get ten of them working overtime, and that, those ten people weren't budgeted to do any overtime. Yeah. So we need to identify to what extent the o the quotes problem erm is cau is, is skewing the figures primarily to be able to get a forecast view of, okay what's the overtime likely to do over the year? I mean as long as it, as long as the graph is reshaped rather than the massive overspend cos at this rate, we're gonna be spending out er three hundred thousand pounds over just on overtime er which we obviously can't afford to do. Erm but that's if you just progr project forward where we are cos we used up in, in three months what we should have done for the whole year so you've only gotta do that, so we've done a hundred thousand pounds this first quarter and if you've four more, three more quarters there's another three hundred thousand pounds over budget. The point is, one of my points is that two things are, are likely to happen. One is that the, the impact of quotes and the other improvements coming through in the second half of the year will reduce some of that impact anyway and also that that hundred thousand pounds overspend is sig is over-skewed because the proportion of quotes work in there is actually making a, making a difference too. But we need to know by how much. So what we're trying to do is get a picture of, okay, what's our, our best guess scenario, what the whole year's gonna look like. We should have that in a few minutes on the, the quotes side, Mark's gonna bring them in to me. Yeah okay, fine. Erm so I think we've gotta look at that right across the board though, we've gotta know that in actual fact we're covering it temporarily, erm or aren't we covering it temporarily. I think all the work that we did indicates that there the productivity is one issue, that unless you're doing the two point eight or whatever's in the budget, you know, we're not gonna get near it. But the other thing is the work that we did on, all the hours that er aren't available on the team Yeah. and that isn't gonna go away unless we No it isn't, it isn't gonna away but when you go back to these figures we've actually been working, if you wo if you accept that there's been, there's no change in our situation apart from auto-offs and units Mm primarily As from now? As from now. Well th since Right yeah since December Yeah. we should be able to maintain the performance that we've done prior to December cos everything else should be equal. Right? With Yeah or without the T As and, and all, with all the other bits and pieces. So what we need to be able to identify is that,al although we will gain the worst scenario ought to be that whatever we lose in terms of auto-off reports and units reports to some extent we should be gaining by the improved productivity overall. So let's just say it breaks even. So our performance, in terms of F T Es per thousand pound, per thousand item, should be running more or less along at the November December level. Right? Now what we've got here, if you look at the F T for ten thousand in force policies, we've got a significant jump in January and February at a time when our budget posting was down below budget. Now that's fair enough because we've actually bunged more in in terms of testing, we're covered in testing, and we've got temps who are less productive, so to an extent we, we, we, we ou our budget did expect that bump. What we should expect though is that it comes back down to around the three point five mark for the year. Now if that is true then we ought to be able to re- forecast a year getting a reasonable assessment, okay, on what's that going to do. So what I'm saying is that although there will be an overspend, it shouldn't be massive cos the overspend would effectively be the hump right at the beginning of the year. I don't think it's as simple as that because at the time that we were doing the budget, we were doing it really in September, and most of those other cate categories of work, apart from like auto-offs reports and things, weren't having an impact. And all, all the other things we've listed out that have taken up time of the team weren't being done in September. We were doing other things last year. We were doing other things. Loads of other things. I don't think I don't think simply by looking at auto- offs reports or E D S R work is going to solve our problems in time do you? But I don't I don't s No I haven't seen anything that, that actually says, suggests to me that you've got another, any other special cause between now and last autumn. Othe the only other thing that could be in there would be an increase in post, fundamentally. Which we haven't had. Which we haven't had. No. Well we might be having in, in March if eastern region's anything to go by, cos it's had a twenty four percent increase, then it might be a, a double blip, a blip under and a blip over, which would therefore f it would therefore follow that your erm your workload level is gonna be consistent. What we don't know is whether March is a start of a new trend upwards above budget, that's a different scenario cos then you can say okay, just like we talked about with claims and E W S. But if you take the, the servicing sections overall, what we should be able to say is that look okay we're gonna have a delayed kick in of improved productiv because it, productivity cos of new systems that are helping us, whether it moves us from two point six to two point seven to two point eight is arguable, and we won't know that for sure until we get there, but we shouldn't have is deterioration. I don't e I don't see any reason why we should have deterioration. Cos the work that the T As are doing now are just different projects to the one they were doing before. I mean you've had Sue, Sue for example tied up on and all those sort of issues, Bob 's been dealing with pr pension conversions and stuff like that for, for months on end, so we've been dealing with other projects, all that's happened is the work has been redirected onto a different type of project. Now we've lost a lot of resource erm in the clerical area, in this first quarter,t t to release people to go and do testing work we've taken on temps. Now the temps an and the two new business people for example have definitely had an impact on our ability to be as productive as you normally expect to be. That's why I would expect to see and we planned to some extent, we may have under-planned an increase in costs. But I don't see any reason why we shouldn't ever get back to where, to the last quarter, if you're excluding December, of ninety two. That should actually be our benchmark, I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to achieve that. Now the very simple thing is if we just stop doing this other project and get the T As back down on to, if, if we need to do that. But I don't see any reason why our that we shouldn't have the ability, as a man to making management decisions, that makes the productivity and cost profile achievable of at least what it was before Christmas. Now that's all I'm saying. Unless of course we have a significantly increased level of erm of post and then that changes the scenario quite again. Now we're planning to do a, we don't wanna do another budget, re-budget forecast until June July, we, cos it, we don't need to do one for this bu any budget year starting July, we're gonna work on the calendar year. Erm but one of the things that we, that we will need to do is actually to review the overtime for the last three months to say okay, what's it actually been spent on so that we can start to er make sure we've identified the reasons for it. If the reasons for it are accommodating the release of people to, like Pam, Lewis and Ron and people like that whom we've released, erm and the experienced temps then you can at least say when they come back then that position should revert back to the norm. So Some of that's been done though hasn't it? From what erm we did for yesterday. Mm. Some of it, things like the fax service I think which we certainly weren't doing, were we, in the last last year er review and the mechanics of the fax service we already thought that took up a lot of hours you know just putting, faxing them through, receiving them But then you, that outweighs No that ma that's saving us time the, the time wasted on phone calls doesn't it? Yeah. I mean at least when you're getting the faxes and it's being recorded as working there's an enquiry Mm we weren't convinced. When we worked it out as an average that the sheer monitoring and chasing quotes or following up quotes erm and just preparing the documentation, we weren't convinced that was the case at all. You'd expect the productivity to fall wouldn't you, if you were actually operating a fax service because you'd save, you'd take more time to monitor it Er yeah whereas the exact opposite's happened in west, the productivity on the section with the It can't. fax service has shot up, whereas the other one I think it should shoot up. operating a I do. normal service has gone down, so Mm. I don't see any reason why it, why it shouldn't do. Why it shouldn't improve it. Because A you're not wasting the time, you're not worrying about the post sort, you're getting the stuff quicker, you've got the thing logged in and logged out erm so to, to a great extent, I mean er we should be ab I personally think that we should actually s be trying s we should be expecting to see an advantage but let's just take that as as, as, as neutral so that you haven't got a er a worsening situation and you haven't taken adva taken advantage of any Mm er have any advantage in that. We're also running erm without, we must be running without or we've got a significantly reduced level of chase-ups because our turn- rounds are, in most areas, are significantly better than they were. And th and we've sustained that now for several months erm much more so than we did when we did the thing at the end of ninety one. Erm now okay I accept that erm what you're getting now or starting to get through in some areas is a higher degree of expectation, but if we're not achieving that then I think it's something to do with what we're, the way in which we're, we're operating rather than the fact that it isn't achievable. Mm. Okay? So all I'm saying is, if we're not achieving that we need to go back and look at the way in which we're operating the fax service, have a chat with erm Phil's people or Jackie's peo see if there's any differences that we can take advantage of. Are we er are we, you know, gilding the lily? If, cos if we are, we can't afford to. Yeah. It's as simple as that. Erm so I all we're trying to do now at the moment though is, is to, to operate from the point of view of saying look, if you actually take all these things into account, we shouldn't be worse than we were ultimately, once these systems have bedded in, we're doing more checking on letters for example th than, than we w we won't have to once we've checked through the first two months of auto-offs, and we're getting used to the new reports and so on and that sort of stuff, so we expect there to be a blip, but you would expect a learning curve in anyway. That's what I'm saying. So once we're through that we need to be able to say okay, if there is a significant shift in the mix of work, then we need to be able to quantify exactly what that is. Yeah. Okay? But I'd've thought that, that generally speaking, we should have been able to at least hold the line. Cos if we haven't then all of our assumptions into why we're doing things like auto-offs and it improves the outgoing costs and then we've got better reta better information and better screens and all that sort of stuff, I mean it blows every single assumption we've made in a way. You know that you've got, the fact that you can get current statements at the press of a button from July onwards, we should be able to say that means that on the teams that haven't gotta control the work going round to quotes and back again, having it typed and back again, Mm. there should be improvements in those areas. That, that should surely improve turnaround times. Which yeah which are already going down anyway It won't, it won't improve turnaround times generally speaking on the quotes area cos that's kept separate. Doesn't that affect teams? It will it will im Yeah cos improve the overall yeah. It will have an improvement but I, I think we get that almost for free. But it, well what it will do is it will actually mean that you haven't, shouldn't have to worry so much about keeping logs of what you've sent round and, and so on. Mm. So all I'm saying is that that's what we should expect to see. Now the r the truth is, what we've gotta now check out, is actually is that reality, is the reality wildly out. Cos if it is, how much are we gonna have to pay for it, and why and what can we do to try and bring it back in. And that's what we've gotta try and do in the next, next few weeks really. And monitor it very closely. Erm one interesting point about overtime and temps er generally is that temps apparently unl are costing us around about fourteen K with overheads which is a lot more than I believed to be the case. Er and Mark was saying to me yesterday Erm Mark was saying yesterday that, unless you're erm going to be getting overtime done erm by supervisors, in which case temps are cheaper, you're better off using overtime er clerical staff than you are getting temps in. So it's, if you're overtime is at the grade C level, or the workload is at the grade C level, then you're bet it's cheaper to get overtime done than it is to get temps. That's the agency temps I presume? All temps according to Mark. There will be the very few exceptions. Should we not also still go for the, if we can, the one and a half times they work Saturdays? That'll make it even cheaper, instead of double time. No well what we said is we're gon gonna scrap Saturdays unless we s consider it to be critical and unavoidable on the basis that, if they, they can work Saturdays if they'd rather work Saturdays than in the week, but that's their choice not ours But then they get pa they do it get paid for time and a half. Yeah Right. Is, that's the decision from now on is it? Well we, we're saying that now are we? Yeah, I think we should say that, well really, unless we've got anything scheduled in the next week or two, let's get them out the way Does that apply to E W S as well? We've got, we've got two in er April April. Well then let's fill in April, then I think we should actually make sure that we're comfortable that is essential and th that there is overtime being worked there that couldn't have be worked in the week. You know I mean okay talking vast I mean there's the argument I know people vary with their opinions but is it more productive on a Saturday? I think Yeah that's the way mine tend to think it's more productive on a Saturday. I think so. Mine are exactly split. Some think it's a waste of space and others think, you know, it's er Well in er I think you've gotta weigh up the p the productivity element against the cost, cost of it. cost effectiveness I think it must be easy to plan mustn't it if you know you've got that top number of hours from looking at what you've got What essentially what you need to do how to do is if you wanna be able to work Saturdays we need to be able to prove that in fact pound per, per item of post on a Saturday is cheaper than because the productivity in the week will be lower therefore and even at time and a half, the cost of doing an hour's overtime for the work you get out in the week is, is less productive than doing double time with what you get out on a Saturday. If that can be proved then we've got a case. If it isn't then what we should then be saying is no week time over no week time work and just all work Saturdays if you see what I'm getting at. If we can actually demonstrate that, but you've gotta see a significant improvement in your productivity on a Saturday to make it worth your while. But I think it does doesn't it? By the volumes Yeah Prove it. they produce. Yeah. Well we've got plans, Mark you know produced plans with productivity for Saturdays alone. In which case then we should be able to say that Saturday working costs X X pounds per item, and in the week it costs Y pounds per item. If X is cheaper than Y then you've got your case. Then you ban the weekday overtime. Is there certain work there that has to be done during the week and can't wait till the weekend? It will just come down to organization really won't it? Between the teams. Well I think it's an important issue, we need to sq we need to squeeze every, every pound out that we can if we're not to if we're not to affect our service level. But the o the one thing I wanna say is that erm we need to do all we can to keep the c the over-run down to as low a figure as possible, and that's our job. Bob's already indicated that he doesn't, he wants to do everything he possibly can to avoid us having to affect service levels okay, and obviously the overtime is the one thing that really is, stands out as being the issue anything else cos I mean our salary costs are there, there or thereabouts erm with the temps in it, erm we know we've got erm some temps. One of the issues is we're not quite sure whether we've got a change in our planned spend, which is what makes the, the comparison against budget look as bad as it currently does, or whether in fact we genuinely are gonna over-run significantly. So what does that mean with us doing with overtime at the moment then? Sorry? Cos we're, we're averaging what, two hundred hours per team per month? Mm. Well I think you, you, you've got, well you've got, if you're gonna work overtime, you've got to make sure that your productivity justifies it. That it isn't just to catch up with unproductive people. Yeah I'll ask supervisors to do everything by batch as opposed to allowing X number of hours, but then on top of that, saying alright you've got thirty hours this week Mm sure. allocate it how you want. Yeah. I think it does mean though that issues like erm long term sickness erm the issue that you've got with the two people in your patch, one of whom might go to the help desk, you need to get that resolved P D Q so you can say well I've reduced my h the temp over budget by one. Okay? So that then we can actually get somebody in there that can do the job properly. And then we'll have to deal with that other one and er and, and resolve that one way or the other and make, make sure we've done that reasonably reasonably quickly, either g sending her back to new business or er trying to find another position for her if she can't actually cope with that. Mm. Erm the J C one we'll have to try and deal with that again as a separate issue but I don't, I mean the amount of time we're losing from high levels of sickness we talked about a c couple of meetings or so ago, about the absence levels with some people, we've just gotta make sure we crack that on the head, we're just haemorrhaging money, the fact that it is not just hours it's money. We should be getting another one out soon shouldn't we, end of March? Yeah there's no reason why you can't ask Trudy for an update now, you don't have to wait for Tr for Trudy's report. If you want updates on those key individuals then let's get some. But let's make sure we, we can make, make a k key point of that. Did you do anything with the erm names we gave you for nil absence? For nil absence? No I haven't done anything with that yet. Erm we, we can do. Is that over ninety two? Well over the the Since the last calendar year from It was last year wasn't it? during ninety two. Yeah. So what are we doing on the overtime then, Saturdays, at the moment? I Are we gonna go away and work out how much it is? Yeah I think, I think what wh er you do need to have worked out in, in your own minds and justified it what your plans are in terms of u realizing the extra resource whether it be by temp or by overtime. But the w clearly, in, in budget terms, we haven't got any left for the rest of this year now clearly then we that means we're gonna overspend. The question is by how much. Now But we have to keep in mind that we're not gonna let service levels deteriorate so We don't wanna l no. But I think, but I do think it does mean that the first thing we say is that the work is more important than some of, maybe some of the, the nicer to have three year projects at the moment. And that's gonna have to be some of the things that suffer. If for example you've got a problem with productivity in your patch, erm because of the, the reasons we've talked about, it does mean that perhaps you need to say to whoever has been, is off and doing other projects that they'll have to stop doing that until you've got the productivity up till you can release them back again. I think they'll have to recognize that it's gonna be roll your sleeves up and we're go we aren't gonna be able to do all of the things we wanted to Also erm It's no problem but polystyrene plastics are are very good crystals. Yeah. We're not using polystyrene anyway. There's a thirty three in there. Ah, ha ha ! Uses thirty five mill ? Wah ah oh oh oh Oh. . It's definitely a thirty five. . What would use thirty three Norm ? Yeah, well it's small.. Yeah. Erm He's trying to think. Must have updated the crystals then? It's I think I might have erm used thirty three on the crystals and now the shape's been updated. And there's nothing particularly unusual on that. Crystal's would be erm one eighths And the veers What about the veers? They're quite small. These are twenty fives aren't they? These are twenty , yeah. These are twenty, yeah. Thirty threes, thirty seven forty six, so well thirty threes must be the crystals, thirty fives I don't see what they're gonna be. er sha What letter are you er Oh I'm not worried about the letters at the moment. Just got it sitting in Well it's never had that before, I'm just trying to work out where it's come from. Can't you do a a select? Name select or something and pick out a one of the pads with that hole? No, you can't, there's erm I see. You haven't got anything unusual that's gonna be small. No. Oh I've got a thirth three hold iron or on the er crystals look. Yeah, alright. Tha , that's probably a mistake in the past before we had all this changing. Right. I'll define Cos now we've gone up to thirty fives, I'm pretty sure. Just er They're both the same footprint, those two Sorry? These two are the same footprint. Yeah. What about that one there? Bedge? Oh that's cute! Oh ah Who got that one? Little one there. I think they should all be er I know what it could be! I know what it is! We know what it is. Er What a , what are Zener diodes called, shape? Which ones? Jus Just a normal Zener. It's not on there but Oh erm It's on the back. R four, no D D three over four sixty? Is that a normal , a normal Zener one, Z is is in some ways. I think it uses the same footprint doesn't it? Yeah. Oh hang on, let's let's let's do it the easy way. It's very quick. Two, three and a so sixty that's good innit? Whoops! And si , six, six, six, six, six, six. I bet you pound of thirty fives cos that's a new one machine. That's a new component I put on there and that would be updated , yeah. there. That's what it is. So all the thirty two's have gotta be changed to thirty fives. Well , is it thirty three, or thirty five. Thirty five rings a bell, erm . Oh, find out . I can't find an easy one can I? I could look at the library can't I? Yep. Cos I know they're all up to date. You know the check that went in? Mhm. Something vague with this split window innit in? See if they're in the same file and two different bits two places on the file. It's doing code and you need to change several entries or something. Mm mm. Just split your window. Brilliant! I'm not with you. Well if you've got a big file right? And you're changing all your currencies of a certain variable Yeah. you can have it at the top where you've changed it and then the window underneath you can scan it through the file again. Alright? Brilliant! Nice though. You pick them . Can't you just do a find? Can you Find and replace. wait five minutes? Yeah, you probably can. Cos I've got something to take over, you might as well take them over . Can you find the ye , if is there any yellow pads about? We've gone right out. I'll pick up somewhere. Er, yellow pads? You know the you pull out the information. So what were you up at lunchtime then? Thirty seven is a different one altogether again isn't it Norm? Hang on! Make that the same After you call the same symbol alright? I make it the same size okay? I wouldn't of thought there's sod all difference between thirty three and thirty seven. No. Yeah, but you have to tell it. I'm not ready Norm! Cos it sees both of those holes in the data range. Oh ya! Hey, I saw this bird Norm Yeah. Yeah. That Justin's trying to er Pull pull. but he says he isn't! Don't laugh! He's completely ignoring me now! Now I've seen him interfering with the smoke alarm now! Thought that was quite remarkable! Oh you know that we were talking about What she look like? working here from the pub. Dear oh dear oh dear! Yeah. Still soaring in he with that? What a halibut ! E any good for a titty wank No, no good for a titty wank No, totally bare! A titty wank ! We used to call it breast fucking but that's much nicer! No, too Tha , that's too descriptive. titty wank All calls for a Titty wank tea break and I like that, I like the er the phrasing. Titty wank Titty wank Did you have a titty wank over the er weekend now your wife's back? Ah! No? Not big enough mate! No, nor is that, bloody right ! What the tits or er Well if it was if mine was small I'd be alright on mine. Ah well! Titty wank, I like that ! It's one of the funniest things I've heard for Oh, minutes! Micro-seconds! Urgh, what a horrible colour! Norman's got the bland taste again. Yeah. I didn't set this one, this is bloody he set Oh that's it up! gross! What? Right. Gross of public . Expensive . Yeah, get my posh car. Do you know you could do this? What? Not edit within capitals. Oh the software problem. No I didn't. I asked Daniel to leave. Have they? No. No, no, no, leave the room. Leave the room. It's alright bu get off your high horse! I was just gonna say why? No. Well I don't know. I reckon that Daniel's . Might be. Has he had a bad appraisal then or something. I dunno. Dunno. Kevin had one. Well Kevin's a wanker! His . Erm Well give us a shape to look at then. Can't I get. Sorry? Come on! How long you gonna be? Not long. Z three over four sixty? Good grief! On the score sixty. Mm, mm mm . That's the way . That's what we call innit? What's five thou Thirty five thou for the lo Alright. you take three under sixty. What about fourteen dip and under school osc That's a nice one! I think that was drill under Was any school table. Are you sure? You sure Bedge? Drill un under school osc What the first bit of that cos the thing in your mouth. Fourteen dip under school osc Graphics are crap, look at tha , look at that! Oh! Gone completely ! It's not overwriting it is it? Yes! Right. Have you got nothing else to do apart from squeaking chair? Hasn't bought the bloody letters with it! I'm here,. Dash Thirty three, forty six. fetch ! Have you Bedge! erased that layer? Yeah it's all gone now. Sorry I'll get the old Thirty three paint pot. Thirty three is the oscillator Right it should be thirty three. Well that's what they use in the library so that's a I'll make sure the library ones are correct on mine, alright? What are the other oscillators? Thirty five is point nine. That should be point eight five. Should it? Yeah. So it should be dip , thirty three and Yeah. What's the other oscillator, that one that's you lie flat An eighteen osc or something. It's H C eighteen. H C eighteen. Alright, we're gonna have to do a well hard copy here. Oh shit! That means we're gonna have to rebuild that bloody Hang on! Zoom in. No I think the I think they're there. You might find they're with the scrap. Okay. It's it's no problem. It's found it all has it? Yeah, should of picked it all up. That's right. I gotta rebuild this anyway. What a bugger! Yeah, the erm small oscillator is a thirty three as well. Alright. Ah ha ! So there is a difference between thirty three and thirty five? Correct! Looks that way. I'm gonna delete this one. Although saying that one we sent out to erm Yeah. they actually drew the wall at point nine Or point nine five. oscillated everything. The pads are big enough to take it but when we a , you know that, when we had that problem about the er what's a name coming up? Yeah. The solder coming up, we decided we'd go down to what size it should be. Yeah. Thing is the th The bulk of the drawing rules were such that you got the pin diameter plus you know, their size pads and all this and stuff. Yeah. So we basically done to what that is although they said they were just gonna dri , drill a one point nine five Mm. and sort of run it from there. Well it's a strange fault cos Very. Very! They make a big thing about some things, and then some we're gonna drill all that point nine five anyway! Yeah. They made a big thing about us sort of not using one millimetre holes using Mm. point nine five holes, cos that's standard size But that's that's sod all! Yeah. We wouldn't have used one mill on the sc for out side counters and letters they said oh no, they were gonna use wha you know er what's a name? Mr Point nine five. Yeah. Mr was well upset! Phylis? Well upset! Why? They're gonna charge him for casting his . Well course they are! He's dying though! Poor chap! If he was get, get in off his death bed and in. Serves him And when right! He's got When he did plenty of money anyway! wondered if I should have his place. When is it? Er, tonight. I can't play tonight. I'm already playing tonight. Yeah. John might. Four point three O. Four point three O, okay. Are the printers on? Think so. Ah ga ga ga Yeah, they should be! Is it, ain't worth trying him? I can't think of anyone else. Have to Okay. . What about the other one Mr ? if he's genuinely ill, know what I mean? Yeah. Did he what badly? Got flu or something. Yeah. Sounds well rough! He reckons he might be in tomorrow. Yeah. well rough! Right, I better go and ring and cancel my night then. one of those favours . Ta! Er well I gotta phone someone up. ello, yeah I just er wondering can I court I booked for Wednesday night please?

No adaptor. Take this then. It's quicker. Well usually cos I got my feet up on a bench and I can't reach keyboard so I had a fishy sandwich earlier and I feel . I'm not surprised! Especially at the exhaust end . smell it? Yeah. Basically! You bastard! Er Keep . What's the matter with it? Has it got a hole in it? Now I've well I'm trading it in on Saturday night.

And fortunately the end cap was like a , so I went and then I stuck some wadding in just to wire in that head lamp. Help with some erm propylene. Mm! alright Malgood is it? or . Right, I'll have to try it. Bad as that . Sticks in meant to blow it out. It's not cracking now. What's in there at the moment? Well they normally just packed with some sort of wadding, I dunno. Probably asbestos or something. Got a , hell of a hot temperature in an exhaust. Er yeah. Oh just buy a couple of bananas and apple ! ! It'll fill the end up! More like the holes in. Wha what are we on? Drill. Yeah. On the score. No Not plated. Or P T H doesn't really matter which one you got. Okay. So then straighten that end tail. Drill table. What the one that should of been here? Yeah. Just extract it now then. Oh I see, right. Yeah it's got some er,. Course it is. She'll be disappointed! Hello Phil! Alright? Come and join the party!

Right? L? Well L is Non-plated. Yep. As it is, it's three point eight. Did I say two point eight. Yeah. L, three point eight. Yeah, but I mean were they all on the ? Well you wouldn't hold twenty one of these. Or one of these. T's Er Er sixty. They'll probably be old ones. They're probably in there. In the cellar. OMT's again. Where's the board gone? It's round here. I still don't know what he's doing, he's probably got a or something. No, they're Yeah. Two point fives. It's under there the crystal. The regulator. L, yeah, it could do. It's no longer there. Yeah, that's bigger than one point three though isn't it? No. Yeah, that is a huge space three points. Oh two point eight this is. Oh sorry, did I say two point eight? Yeah. Yeah. We're looking for Yes that's what it is. Yeah, but let's not use any more. Well, what we'll do we we'll fill these out right and then we'll do a plot info then we gotta find out what actually he has used. Oh God! No, gotta cancel , go on! Hang on, let me save this first. So Cos what it does, it remembers tools tool holes that used to be on there. It's a bit of a pain! No point in saving it. It's lovely doubly Five foot. Just write it on a bit, bit of paper. On there.

You know the easiest way don't you? Delete the whole lot and start again. No. Fill out a drill template with just the K hole in it Yeah! That'd be quicker. Well go do it then! you can't find those holes by saying find it you know the holes ce certain Find hole. diameter. Well you can. Well they're all on the board somewhere. You can but er Bedge hasn't he likes the hard way you see. Mm. You mean Bedge can find your ? oi!! Lovely! Piss off! Why don't you lot wank you there!

What's the difference between point eight five and point nine? Point eight Okay. five diameter is sweet bugger all! Anyway, we want A alright? Okay, B nought point eight five B Think about it,is what? Well board E F and H D's you mean! and A alright? I'll have that one that one okay, E Why don't we just mark all the ones that are being used by saying And the problem is text? Good You need grief! a nought point eight five. And then go What are you trying to do? like that. And so, we're gonna use a point five. What are you doing? And we're gonna use a point nine. Well hang on a sec , cos you've gotta get the letters translated, it depends what's in your drill template dunnit? Fucking hell! doing just don't use the whole line! Hang on a sec , look, look, look! All we've gotta do, alright, is that list of holes that are actually on the board alright? Alright. These are the ones the what's it's given us alright? Drill template. So we'll start with twenty we've we want twenty thirty three exists thirty five exists Except thirty three Alright? and thirty five are gonna be combined. Well hang on a sec let's let's just see which ones we need. Well mark them. Four, thirty seven Yeah , hang on a minute. Small one. Lesley! Well you, you be going through and just tick off which just stroke a line through the ones we don't want. ello! Oh right! Okay. Go for it! Hello Phil I'm upstairs. Yeah, that thing next to the . Oh mm mmmm ! Okay. . Okay. Er it's it's probably wasting her time. Trying to . Okay? Yeah. Yeah. Ah, but we we got some gear on site because been working on them so . Erm they'll just have to sort that mess out.. you could bring it round to the corner. Resolution is thirty five, thirty Yeah. seven, four Okay. fifty one. Thanks very much for letting us know . Yep! Bye! Andy! Andrew ! What? Yeah? Right, how you doing? Right a hundred and fifty's not used, and thirty three and thirty five are gonna be combined. It's on here but it's not on here. Right, that's good. Right, so we're using all the others are we? Mm! Twenty thirty three, thirty five, thirty seven, forty, fifty sixty, eighty, one, ten, three,thr , three hundred and fourteen. Excellent! So a hundred and fifty we don't use and, you've already defined that E and F will be the same Yeah. on here? What you'll have to do in here right, because E and F you'll still have to have E and F alright? But quoted as the same size alright? Well E and F on here is er thirty three. Oh right, sorry! That's I me , erm F and H. Make them both point nine five then. Well ho is this is E and F, thirty three, thirty five, how come we got point eight five and point nine? Well cos you got this lot wrong didn't you? You did all the letters wrong. No I didn't! I put all the letters in and you told what Well you took them off that didn't you? and then you told me what to put in on the plated through and stuff! From that ! They don't tally do they? I know. Well only cos F is in there now. Well that's probably where I'm wrong. Hang on. A is twenty. Make Hang on. Go on you can work it out! This is . This is in millimetres and this is in millime no this is in . They're all in . And this is in mill Right. We got it all written down look. Okay, right, so point five is twenty, which you've got right? As long as your drill template tallies with this alright? And you don't miss out any letters that occur except for the L, right? Cos we won't have any L's right? So occur on that, right? Mm mm! So this is what we're actually You ne you need two. this is what actually using on this design? Yep! This is the old one? Yep! Some of the holes are not used at all. Yep! So, are we gon do you get rid of the hole size along with letter. No. Keep, you'll have to keep the letter because that letter will come up alright? So these details So will be put in here, this is what they're actually gonna use. Yeah. I mean, for instance, make erm make F nought point nine five as well . Alright? Yeah, so you have to make them the same. Yeah. Right. Cos so we've actually got F and H on the form. Yeah. On the . Okay? Yeah. Fine. Barbara something innit? Mediterranean tomato that is. Ah!

Don't forget push him to . Yeah. have a wank isn't he? Sure!. Cheers Ron! That it's been taken away. Yep! Therefore, on the Web it says, completed! Yep! The er people that pay the bills say oh well that's no good to us! What is the use of having this wonderful Well I Web system Well when they don't fucking look at it! It's supposed to be Well how do they know? for everybody on site. Precisely! The whole system is But they're a , they're a law smooth running. unto themself! They still want a paper system! They still want me to send paper work to say it. Which we do all that anyway, always do. They're fucking useless! No! Wha what happens if the good come from the store? You don't have to do any paper work do we? I do! What's that for? What's Tough! that for? Circuit boards and tough! No, you get paperwork from there. Yeah but I know! surely that system of paperwork shuffling is is gonna come to end with this. Well it bloody should do! Is it because well the whe whe when they the good they come from internal store Yeah. they that are sent over or what? Oh I dunno! I will just fill out what she wants me to do. They'll probably end up paying twice for it. Because I recko , I reckon they must of been paid for that because Maury hasn't been phoning up and saying oh you haven't paid it! They've obviously ! Yeah. She usually pho phones you up about a month afterwards, you know there is a sort of a problem. I'm pretty sure we must have paid it cos I'm sure she would have phoned us. Cos it's got my name on there. She'd know it was me who got it. Well it's not one of these weirdos! . What? You wanna do it like this one though. Yes. Mm, fucking right! Yeah, you're telling me! But , you said you only wanted four lines! Yeah I know but if I have, say if I have six lines Yeah, well you then just go and change them for that one drawing! You can't see with the th the colour,a better colour. Like black or Ah! No, transparent's better innit? Yeah. You sure your right? I'm sure you got some That's okay, they're all pins. No, not pins, erm veers and veers aren't a problem. You can check with the governor! Small boy! Small boy says it's okay. Ah! Oh God! Fucking move them to those! Ah,lol lol lol lol Oh ! Problems, problems, problems! Oh er! Right where are they? Okay. Why don't you do a Mark . Here to here, forget it! Now, if I click on there and see it Delete it you've got now, but forget it. We're not worried about that. If I erase it I lose the veer Ah, cos there's an extra vire there is there? Yeah. But it stops short and the other one overlaps it. Ah, leave it then. Yeah, I mean it's silly things really. Yeah, leave it. Undo. I don't know why erm We should of done these before we erm Out of the book . Yeah, but leave it. That's cos you had a sort of go at it. Yeah, if there's another re-work we'll sort these out to re-wire. Tha that's why I'm a bit concerned about messing around s straightening and that sort of thing, cos I'm sure I've had this problem before I'm sure that it reduces a lot of er Yeah, but you've still gotta do it. You still gotta move stuff around ain't you? Yeah, well what I do is I delete it Tidy it up. Yeah. and then I draw back in. Cos afterwards Yeah, but then if you run this your ri Yeah but , I think if you straighten lines and mess around with them too much it leaves little bits in underneath the other one. Yeah but there's not a lot of difference in the amount of time is there? By the time you've you've moved them all rather than drawing them all in again then you run the con activity and swop back. Cos you're gonna have to run con activity anyway. Well it's just down here with the plate And another thing is to is to to run con activity before you output the plot. Yeah. But a little short thing like that isn't gonna hurt is it? No. Leave that. Right. Okay. Er, what else is there? There is , that's the er crystal. Yep! That's good! That's right. Which had been forced. Yep. I'll just show you what was on there before. See they're not fully connected. No. Move back. Right, okay, let's have a look. It looks okay. Better colour, alright? Er, so which one shall we . Yeah. dunnit? I can't see anything wrong with it to be honest. Signal feed back is non-reflectives. Is it because this package has been messed around with? And that thing should be a a bra , a main No. pin? No? Right! Interesting! Right, I'll show you this. Hang on sec , I'll just look in Right, it's here right not fully connected right? Now Yeah. the problem here is between this point here right? Which is one of them, and I'll go over there, this is one of them. So the thing is And there. Yep. There right? And There. there. So it's between it's just on that bit there? Yeah, and also this S this bit here, which which I was Signal being traced, three nine four thousand. That blue trace there and this blue trace here it says there's a problem stubbing it. If you mark it, delete it and re-draw Yeah. there's not another one underneath. So I dunno why it's causing a problem really. Stubs in signal. It's not a trace, that those co- ordinates it's Bib bib Sorry, can I just interrupt? Mark darling, have you Barbara's address in Felixstowe? I was looking for the same thing yesterday ! Were you? Yeah. Cos I er you know she sent a thing, well I you know you sent the thing with the address and I Yeah. well I lost it! Okay. I had to get si , see I was gonna give it to you.

Not that I don't trust him or anything! I think what it is Yeah. I don't think, when you draw this trace perhaps it went just over the pin and didn't click it down. Ah, but when it's actually done it'll be connected won't it? Yeah. . Aha. I'd like to get this out the way really cos then I can get on to something else.

Oh, so that isn't all the problems then? No. Ah! So once you've chewed those you should run it again? Yeah. Oh I didn't realise that! We should run it again anyway! Ah!

Cos what I tend to do is I do a full board there find out Yeah. where it is and then zoom. Yeah. So you've, actually saving Clicked up on the C N C. Yeah, just turn all items off in that window all full board right? And then, what a so, you get a huge star there you just zoom around about erm Isn't that lovely! and you're there. And can you zoom off? Experience mate! Can you zoom in on that window then? Or is that always full board No it's type window? it's exactly the same window as this, you can edit in it, you can do everything. It should go past the window. So how do you how obviously you do you have the cursor in here when you hit zoom? Yeah. And then you go in there. And then yo , you edit box in there. If you had it in there it would actually zoom that way? Yeah , I mean if you go erm if I go zoom here right? And then, quickly here That does that, right. Right? But then if I go zoom in here Oh I see. and I go into that pad, say Single level three. and you can't see it cos I got all items on but Yeah. you just get a picture of that pad there So the all items on and off are completely separate from the two windows? Yeah. And is on? Yep! Wonderful! I like that! It's just one of those little things you learn when you working on as many bloody years as I've been now! No, I've never used an extra window. Yeah.

But I wanted to know, people dead weird and anyway it turned out, do you believe in ? I think so, yeah. Cos I'm sick of telling people that don't believe in it and I feel a complete Right. turd! So Okay. So what happened? But erm it turns out that's what they were. I really a word, and they had a little chat to us. Mm. Well About what? People About the people who are dead? Oh! Oh! About They weren't trying to get you to and, about the you know,th yeah Yeah. Well I because I'm the one who was da doing that because tha I mean I was . But, he was horri the guy that was doing me didn't know he had a pair of a like off er yeah. He was built a bit like Jack. And he had a white T-shirt, pair of jeans, a beer belly and tattoos up his arms. And he was the one Who's the kind of person with ! Exactly! We went into this room and there was this music playing like on the erm like John Indian music. would play on the Oh no. on erm Like in fantasy Yeah. John's sort of thing. You know water a blue light bulb in the middle of the room and I'm thinking, Oh! Come on! What are letting yourself in for? You know. But it was just I mean, the things that they said honestly weird. They're good aren't they? Did I tell you once that a nurse on erm radiotherapy did my psychometry? Yeah. Did I tell you? Yeah. I remember you said. Well this, did I, didn't I tell you? Yeah. Oh sh I've definitely heard this one. What was that? She was holding my fob watch and she said a few things about this, and about us and about dead people and She was closer to you and things like Yeah. that. Yeah. Well this guy, he went Yeah. Oh! the same person was there with exactly the same message. Cos she said what happened was he said Was she fed up? Dunno. He'd already got the message and met someone else ! It's a him. It's a him. They'll not let, let somebody else have a turn ? Well it was, what happened right, I'll tell you the whole story from the very beginning. But basically, the man that, you know, my father said to me well he said to where's the horses? He says I'm getting horses all the time. And of course my Aunty Annie, Gwenny went and he says is it you? I said, well could be. Well, you know He said just everything that was happening, I kept getting horses. And anyway, he said to me he says is there a man in the spirit world close to you? No! So I just thought of my granddad. And I said, yeah, but I was very sort of non-committal Non-committal. Yeah. and very, well I suppose Yeah. kind of Could be. attitude. Could be. Erm, cos I just thought he was guessing, you know, and he said he says, I didn't see him, he said I only saw him and pointed to this girl over the other side of the room he was standing beside you when you were in the chair. Oh no! He says I'll get her to come over and have a chat with you. And she came over after Did she describe him? Aha. So who was it? My dad's granddad. His name Oh no! and everything. His physique, his erm his physical appearance, his character and why he was there and it's exactly what that Merv said off radiotherapy. Mm mm. Why was he there? There's something I've got to do. I need a bit of a push to do it. But there's something that you want to achieve, there's something you've got to do Got to make a jumper. get on and do it. Qualify this. That is exactly what it's not. Yeah. It's your riding. Well that's what everybody says. Yeah. Or it's having a baby. Well I don't think it is. It's probably getting married. It's getting married, yes . I don't think it is. Well what's your main I thi main ambition in life? I think it's to do my riding exams but, I ca as I said, cos Brenda whose horse I ride up at Bridley I was telling her and I said, why would the spirit world get in such a state About riding exam. about me doing riding exams? He said he said which wo what would happen if you got your riding exam when you qualify nursing? I said well I'll probably choose Yeah. riding. I wouldn't know. He said well really for some reason you ought not to be a nurse. I mean, you know how th if you believe in fate and is, is there any control over it or Yeah. is it all planned out for you and Mm. and this kind of thing, is, is someone trying to steer your care or your, the rest Away from of your life? away from something. Which it would be. Away from something. So I don't know, I mean, I'm very open-minded, I mean Oh yeah. but erm he described a, my mum told her everything about a fall the bump on her head, he knew Oh. just loads of things. Very strange. I found that research book. Doesn't Jane look yellow? What? D'ya think Jane looks a bit yellow? I've probably got reflection off her . I know. See if any of us look,ta talking about yellow. Mm. Mm. So? So it was very good. I dunno if I would go to one now. Well I, I want to go now, to er, erm and just try one of the other ones. Tonight I'm gonna go the open circle. I wish I could go. I, I would go, but I'd be frightened to stay there. Well I am whe So am I. see what happened is, I came over and he says, you know I've told this lady that you saw the man standing beside her and she went she sort of, she described him, apparently he was very tall which Yeah. we knew wasn't my granddad cos my granddad was knee high to a grasshopper, erm straight as a dye in character and physical appearance, er like he had a rod up his back which was one of these expressions, Oh! I see. which apparently he was. Obviously I've never met him. I don't think my dad even met him. Yeah. And then she said erm she said, and I suppose she turned to the other guy, she said, we're not supposed to do clairvoyants, like, laughing, you know. And he says, ah, go on it's the end. Cos the all the was over. And then he actually went into a A trance? well not a trance, it was just so normal. She tho she was doing this right as she spoke Like Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost? No! Oh. Dead normal! She, she was going like, you're me and I'm her Ha. and she was standing, I was sitting like, she was standing, she sort of went can you take a Lesley? I went yeah. She says, not in the spirit world. Can you take a what? Lesley. And I said well, yeah and I've got a cousin Lesley . And then nothing more was said about that. And then she was going there's something you need to do. She was literally having a two-way conversation, although, not in an odd way, not going ooh! Ooh! Ooh! You know? She was just like talking to herself, she's going Yeah. and then she would turn her attention back to me. Mm. Oh! How strange! And described him and She thinks she his name. might be going on Wednesday. And Lyndsey might be able to tell you something. Well I know. Well that's what I'm thinking. I'll go, my sister's going with us and I'll, the following Wednesday I'll tell you what it's like. Right. Right. Okay. Come with us. Then we'll go and see the district nurse on Wednesday, is there anything you want me to say? But it's not real But I don't, what if I don't know things? Then I might spend the rest I know. of my thinking I know. It's just that you won't that hasn't happened yet. Well, if you're that sort of person, I would worry about them you see. Now Yeah. someone said to me, I know not, not like an accident or death or anything, but someone said erm you don't have any sisters or something? I would imagine, in my mind, that something's gonna happen to my sisters for her not to be able to see it. I was just thi I remember when I was young I thought my mum went to a fortune teller and, and I had there like tears running Oh! Oh . And she told us we were gonna move to a house with a green door . And did you? My mum bottled out when we got there. Well Bet your there must be a . the thing, the thing that erm worries me is in case I go over is, that you say You're not gonna have any children. you're gonna have two marriages. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's right, you know. Because someone told Tony's mum that Tony would be married twice and the second marriage would be very happy. But then you'd taken that to be that first woman, that Gill person, Gill Yeah Yeah. somebody. Yeah. But that's it. You will really But if they say to me, I'll be marri I'm just gonna be thinking oh my God! But you will relate it, cos no matter what they say you will relate it. Yeah. will be along after this. Keep the noise down thank you. not here. Right. Moving swiftly along er, the little thing on the timetable you know for the the last session where it says quiz it's not really a quiz. It was at the end of the the module. But what we are gonna do is, is give out your study guides and the areas that we'll be revising. We'll do it now. While you're I don't think I'm even gonna bother revising for this. I'm not. Will it be a multiple choice or a written or a Oh yeah. And do I have to ? I think, I think so. A mixture I suppose. Well I can't be A mixture. bothered. Is it serious? Is it like a Serious ? Well it's for yo for your benefit. It's no one 's but . must have all this studying won't they? Don't worry about it. What do you use to chew in Ooh! This looks a little bit less ? doesn't it? What colour is an orange ? What do what is this last thing you have er according to you? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! What?

And certain parts are The false formastation and things. No! That was stupid that! And I got it wrong. You got it wrong? What was that? Blooming stupid question! It was the way it was phrased. Oh, so expulsion of of sperm. And it was, it was something. And it was ejaculation But I thought it was masturbation. Well I thought it was the forced Yeah. Well, it's funny, I was telling Stephen, my boyfriend, about that, and I was telling him the question and he said Yeah. that. Oh. Well Geoff laughed at me when I told him. He said, er bloody typical! Yeah but don't he said . We want a break now. The stupid old bag hasn't looked at it! I've got a headache. That's June . Determined to sort but she's gone now. No, it's not. That's June . She is, cos I lent her th you know. I know. That's what I was thinking. Well they're not the same are they? No. I had to take Tony to the casualty on Saturday? Why?

Yes. well he's er, he says he's done a big X-ray. Mm. This is your study guide. Work your way through the guide and you're going to answer all the questions on the quiz. As usual, the papers are taken and they're kept in the file for yo reference by your personal tutors. The reason that we're gonna produce biological science quizzes is they're, it's from your feedback evaluations that you don't get enough biological science. Soon put right. Not a lot more I can say to you is there? Oh I know. Yeah. I never said that. believe it or not. There's about sixty percent I might have said that. of the people who are at the end of a said they didn't get enough. We haven't had enough biological science. So that'll teach us to . didn't want the sixty percent. the little areas as well though. You do need to have a basic knowledge of Yeah. biological science to understand Unfortunately you didn't have to do the . Providing you have . Would you agree? Yeah. Anybody dares Yeah. to disagree? No. Right. Very sensible. Cos Jane doesn't wanna be on the . Now the nasty erm half past seven session sorted out. What can, what can we do for another three hours ?

When Carole finishes when Carole finishes in this session I'm gonna go and have a chat with her. Because what we'll have to do is negotiate at the end of the next session, whenever we've finished, cos that's entirely dependent on when we get fed up varies on what When we run out say, I mean, you know, what your response to the session is. But usually it finishes within an hour and a half the next session. Which might Right. well finish at five o'clock. Right. Five o'clock. Right. And then i then it's time for a break again. Now I think we've gotta be careful, if we cut out the breaks, you see Aha. an awful lot of people saying let's work right through you're not affective, you're not learning No. if you No. haven't gone away No. and had No. a break. And I mean, there's, you know, the people who smoke need a boost of nicotine they'll go and get Yeah. one. Like if you wanna get a Coke People who drink Coke need a Yeah .

But you know about, typical woman. families have sex before marriage. Well a how many people though Alison? Not very many. Someone in my hairdressers were talking about it.

Along that row, she's, her dad They're very nice. her mum died of cancer. She lives with Ah! Ah! her dad. Mm. How old is she? And she got a younger sister. Twenty. Oh! Oh!there.

What? And then we won't know when we go. I'm getting a bit spooked about this exam now. I am. I keep suddenly thinking of the enormity of it. And th the fact that I haven't really revised. At least you, you are in the same place. I keep thi I keep sitting down to it and thinking God! There's so much I haven't done for this exam. As usual, I should have started ages ago. But I found when I looked at my books a week ago, or a fortnight ago, I thought, oh I know this, I know this, but it's not until you get into it that you think shit! I don't know this and I could be learning. A week ago I didn't know what to learn and now there's so many things that I know I want to learn. Mm mm. Well every time, every time we come in and she mentions, have you done this, that Yeah. and I think Can I have one of them things? I know. You. You. What? Fizzy gum balls. Oh. She always does. Get one of them I'll get one It's only funny when Pardon you! Thi a I have to say that she does it all the time and she goes, looks around. Does it . A girl I used to work with at the Beechams did like really big burps. I'd say she ate about anything and like pardon me. She would . My grandma's like that. Horrible! I mean she wo she says pardon me or excuse me, but it's so matter of fact that I'd be I could never burp like that if I tried, you know. She did a big, I went in the kitchen at at work on Friday and Saturday What time, what time have we gotta, do we have to be back? Twenty past. And the, the chef's were squeezing the custard carton and it was going cos it was the last and the Custard? You mean they don't make their own custard? Nah! They don't make anything man. Tt! And they were squeezing it out of the carton and it was making this right farty noise. I'm not kidding, the three of them,thir thirty odd year old one of them is, they were on the Well I've been floor laughing! One was going, the other ha ha ha! The custard's going My dad's forty And I'm thinking three and he still How old? does things Do you not like that though. do you not laugh when a squeezy bottle does it? No. Oh! I think it's so funny ! I mean, it's funny like when you burp because you get, embarrass you like. Oh no, it makes me laugh. And there's loads of people round about me and I just went wurgh! And I'd like to be fined . I hate people that erm when my dad burps, if, if it was a cup he'd go excuse me, but but it's when they go I hate that! I do. Cos I don't. I'll conceal a burp, no matter where I am. Well you don't obviously ! Well that er popping out. someone really. You could tell I didn't know it was coming. You can tell it was but make Geoff makes him burp. Oh no! I don't. Cos he feels he's got a wind so he Oh I can't force myself. Nor can I. Aargh. What was that? Oh. When's Tony coming for you tonight? I said half past seven. If we finish before then I shall be very annoyed! They said eight o'clock, quarter to. Quarter to eight cos they started at quarter to six. I could just sleep. Just feel like I'm not learning anything . I know. But then the thing is, Exactly. so I'm not learning anything and then we're to . What have I done all day? I know what . in the past two days. It's like what I said to Tony last night when I got in I said, I feel I could have achieved more if I'd stayed at home and revised. Yeah! I could of. He said but,yo you wouldn't of. I said well I would of that's the whole point. I would have revised all afternoon. I know. Anne was saying when Anne she was revising I've never seen No that was right. The whole . . Sorry I didn't offer anybody cos No that's alright. Oh. And I, when she's revising she says oh I've just done about change and theories of change. Who? Theories of change. But we started with Fred and only got Have you remembered that? a third of a ye way through it. Change in the N H S. Change, do you know what change she's talking about? Freezing, something when er a liquid is freezing and it changes when it is you know changes in the physical sense of the Yeah. word. That's what they learn about. I said oh that's what I've got then. Cos I'm talking about change in the N H S is all we can put down. Here's Anne. But then it's just how bad it. Oh! I wish we'd just done that . It's so, simplified. So basic, so logic. I mean, what do we need about planning something? We don't need it. I mean, I didn't understand much to be honest anyway. I wasn't listening cos I was writing them down. The thing is, with this I don't think half the people listen to you're meant to know you're meant to, in these exams you're meant to have everything you should know and everything else That's it. I'm sitting writing notes and I'm thinking am I ever gonna look at these again? Cos every time I have an exam it's a exactly the same things. I have got revision cards coming out of my ears! And erm which I'll never look at again at all. We're all looking very sorry for ourselves. Well what relevance is it to me? Is not I know. I'm not gonna be a nurse anyway. And I'm gonna go away next, next weekend aren't I? Tony said I need to do some exercise late at night. Cos I annoy him. Because as soon as I go upstairs I'm wide awake. Mm mm. He says you should go, go jogging or something late at night. I said well if you got us a dog I'd have to take it for a late night walk wouldn't I? Come jogging with me. Do you fancy coming jogging? What? Last thing at night? Yeah. You go first thing in the morning. I know but I can go at night as well. No, what, do you play squash? What like eleven o'clock? I don't, I've never played it but I'd certainly like to but I wanna play again. I play Mm. He says it's very unusual, you never see me like this . Ooh! I quite fancy doing that. We should have done. You know I was thinking today I was thinking today erm there's a horse Sorry. Say that again. there's a horse erm in some of the fields just coming out of Morpeth towards Newcastle and I saw, pardon me as I was on the bus like yesterday coming into Morpeth and this horse just shot out of nowhere and it was really enjoying itself! It was like galloping along ! as if it was racing. Yeah. Yeah! It was just like this ! And then it thing and it came, it was really galloping towards the fence and then, cor! Right up Yeah. to the fence. It stuck a All of a sudden. And I was looking, I was thinking, oh! To be free like that. Mm. And then today when I was passing it was just munching away in the corner, you know. And I was thinking, tt, it must nice, Alison's got a hobby she can just go out and you know, do it to get away Shall I tell you what it is, sometimes from everything. I go back from , I'm driving over to Brenda's and I'm thinking,, and I really am, I'm driving along, you know like wha when you're in the car by yourself and everything's turning over in your head Mm. and go and I tack up the horse and I get on the horse and everything and I don't mean to say Falls away. I'm drifting through the countryside cos No. it might be and I'll go over the level crossing I'll think, ooh that was a bit you know, things like that and then we'll see another horse in the field and Canter goes, ooh ooh it's all so everything Mm. it's, it's, it's on a different level, it really is. And because you could, you could just like ride away and not come back ever. Even when you come back you feel much better. You feel, oh I really enjoyed that. And it's a different kind of enjoyment, but, I mean I've never played squash Do you feel like that when you run? Well, well it must be the same. Or like when I, if I we say maybe, now I can't imagine feeling like that except with horse riding, but I suppose you do, whatever your thing is. That's it. It is. Er I wish I had a hobby or a outside interest. It has to be outside I think. Definitely. Yeah. Outside outside. That's it. I suppose Suppose like the riding. everyone feels like that. I think I would, I think I feel like that everything will still be there while I was riding along. Oh! I have to stop and think about it, but I You know what your natural endorphin would come to the surface and you just start getting the feeling of well-being. Well that's the thing like, it's You come to solutions and conclusions and everything's right with the world. And we'd better go back now. If you twitched a horses lip or ear that happens, I would really like to see if I twitched your ear. And can we get a Well Yeah. Mm. It brings their endorphin to the . Did you see The World According to Garth? No. On Sunday. Well I saw a little bit of it, if I wo I keep wanting to see this film Mm. and I've never actually seen it. If you know what I mean? And erm oh just put them on that table over there. No I don't wanna get back there, I don't wanna go back up to the wards so I'll go that way or that way? That way. That way? Thanks. Yeah. I've forgotten which way I come in. It's easily done. Bye. And erm he's, he's got these papers like with short stories Mm. and the wind blows them away out of his hand, so erm Shit! Oh shit! you're meant to get them in the bin not out of the bin. And th he's picking them all up and this one there's a like a rockwe erm, doberman pinscher standing and these papers between his legs . urgh! Urgh! Like this, and he's saying, Bonkers, now give me that paper! Give me that paper! The dog just leaps on him right,so he's wrestling this dog, and he's screaming and the dog going, growling at him and everything Aha. and then suddenly you hear the dog goes running off and he's bit its ear! So he goes to see his mother who's a nurse at the Aha. school where he lives, cos she's the nurse, like a matron, and er she said Garth! What's this? Was it its ear ? The dog's ear . It's a little triangle of the dog ! Oh no! I mean it was cruel Oh my God! but it was funny cos he just aargh! Like this . Ah ah ah! The dog went off yelping. Bless its little cotton socks. Bet that didn't release its natural endorphin. Ah Ah. We'll have a slow mosey. Mhm. I find, tell you what I find difficult is thinking and learning in that class. Mm. Some of the people aren't conducive to learning. I know. I know. And I try not to get stroppy, I try to be you know, otherwise I'm being a complete crab and not joining in, but Mhm. I've found I have to have a lot of conditions. Everything has to be just so for me to be able to learn. It has to be right. I mean half the time I think I don't remember anything because er er, people are so busy blooming playing around and Mhm. shouting and And I'm too nosey to block things out. and When I was sitting in that corridor there was one of the tutors on the phone, only for a short while and I couldn't even blot him out cos I was too nosey to listen to what he was talking about. I don't think it's deliberate. But I'm No. I'm reading Just curious. I'm aware of it. Naturally curious. I can't revise when I know that Geoff's in. If he is, I go upstairs to be by myself. The telly has to be off. Well you see I have to have the telly very quiet and last night, ah! To I'm sure he's going deaf you know. Mm mm. And I, I keep going down and I'll turn it down, and then I'll go out room and he turns it back up again. It's like living with a cantankerous old man ! It's enough to make you deaf. What? Well the sound quality's not very good. I says, well I can hear it upstairs! He says well you're The trouble is you're just over-sensitive! what you can hear upstairs is going, ooh ooh, ooh ooh! Oh! Ooh ooh! And the music! Yeah. The theme tunes that are on. Oh ! Dear me! I wish it was that. Well I'll go and get two, three. I'll soon get Oh yeah. Yeah. Well that's your fault. I was saying I thought she was lovely! Yeah. Exclusive to Mm mm. Mm mm. Yeah. It's nearly time for Neil. I'm cold now. It's cold in here. The nights are drawing in. Impact and intervention A ball? bodily functions . The Newcastle College of Health Studies Ball . Yeah? Erm, yes. Twenty pound a ticket! That's what it was last time wasn't it? Meal, disco and band. Well, can I tell you the first one we went to we went to get food and there was none left! Well that'll be on the . And there was a lovely spread! But by the time we got there, and there was and there was people there I've never even seen before in my life! I suppose this one's it's cheap. That was, it's always the one beside the Civic Centre one? Yeah. The one you went to when I was ill? It's good like. Yeah. If you can get in. It was me and Clare dancing on the table there. difficult to get in. At least it was just us and we were gonna Well have you seen Helen's video? No. No. Nobody has. Oh! It's brilliant. Have you,can I ask, have you got pink in your hair? Yeah, I've I sprayed it pink for the Rocky Horror and I can't get it out! I was, I keep looking and I'm thinking Is it pink? it's the light. It's the light. It's still a bit pinky. Just a little bit. Was it good? The Rocky Horror? It was brilliant! Eh! It took four shampoos to, to get the bugger out! I thought it was my eyesight. No. No. I love the Rocky Horror Show! Anyway, she's got the erm video right Mm. and there's a bit with Helen and Steve and you know what Helen was like when they was Steve? drunk. Big Steve. And sh Oh! Right. they showed it to, to me. It was her face! And, and Ellen was gonna bring it into college but ca er Helen said don't you dare! So she's, she's Yeah. cut out that bit. That bit. Ellen cut it off. Oh! Oh! Yeah. Cut it? Yeah. So, it was ever so bad apparently ! It was really good. Everyone was on it. Everyone was having a good time. It was really good. Well th maybe I should look at it seeing as I missed it. I can just remember Helen's bum! You were in hospital. That's all I saw all night! Denise. What on? That do at Aye. I just remember her backside wherever I saw always Helen's backside. I think they should have another one. Seeing as I missed it. Yeah. Yeah. And come back with Mark . I spent my whole night following him around! Following him round. And you, and with Steve, Ellen can pick it out. Oh have you? Well you shouldn't have cos we wanted to see I've seen it and, and it was the best the best time I had was . It was good. Right. Am I telling you about this? Yeah. Sorry. Have I made much sense so far? Yeah. Yeah, but I the man Can I the patient looks outside in and carer looks inside out. Inside out. Right. And here's, here's his journey right. G P appointment, outpatient appointment, tests, admission, medical treatment, nursing care,planning and follow-up. And that's the patient from his journey out? That's his journey right? Here, he's looking in how he came, where is it? Route. Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba But is it the round window, the square window, or the arched window? There's one. Da, da, dee dee dee. Right, it says here,quality can only be asse assured ,pa beg your pardon,if both patient's view, he's looking in there. Right. in, and the care-givers view looking out are in agreement . Right. What if they're not? What To a is the one that we're actually doing? Yeah. That's right. To achieve this quality assurance should mean, that when the patient feels his care is not good he should know how he can complain without any worry that he will be penalized, and in the certainty that action will be taken immediately . And that's these things here. There's patient questionnaires, complaints, da da, er ba la visitor inspections, complaints, patient questionnaire, there's a basically all the same kind of thing, or relative survey. Patient questionnaire. So, basically, what they're saying there's all these things that they'll provide at each stage of his journey so that if care isn't right he knows what channels to go through to complain. My criticism of that being is But what if it's not carried out? it's, it's al the quality's not there to start with. How can you He da he won't know what, what quality of care is though. Well er, the patient has his views about what Yeah. he expects, good nursing care But his views aren't really gonna be necessarily good nursing care cos a lot of people wouldn't know No, everybody's individual. And to get, what it says here, to get quality assurance, the patient's views, and the care-giver's views have to be in agreement. What, say you're the care-giver and I'm the Yeah. patient what I think is good nursing care might not be what you think is good nursing care. But what you know is not gonna be the same. It has to be the same for quality assurance. But it's not gonna be the same. But that will Yeah cos you I tell you what I think It says on our research thing say that, say that erm . Say that Er, say yes to that one. I shan't ask anything. But will it tell me the truth? Well, see, for one is she's not erm as bad as that. You know, some patients I could think of seem to have the idea that everything should be done for them in hospital Mm. and that to them is good care if a nurse does everything for them, but it's not. If, you're taking all Yeah. Mm. And when he goes into Plus they also say that a nurse is always busy and they're angels, and they're, that and the other, that they won't complain. Well that's the only way that this can be assessed, is by, so that the patient blah blah la when a patient feels his care is not good he knows he can complain without any worry . But complaining, I mean, if he's gotta complain it means that quality assurance isn't there. But This is only thing if they've got something to complain about. if you were the patient nurse So there's nothing to actually say In a positive sense? Yeah. Yeah. The only thing that So if it says Yeah. erm meaning ha blah blah and action taken . It should also mean that when Mr , that's it, says the nurses were marvellous, the nurses are able to say in all evidence, and with evidence to support their opinion, yes We were crap! we are really doing a pretty good job. That's all it says in a positi from a positive angle. Yeah but A pretty good job. So what do you think ? But like, if you take like like er,le let me, if you were the patient and Lesley was the nurse like, you wouldn't have a clue whether it was er Exactly. good or not, because as long as it was pretty clean. Let's have a look what examples they're using. Well that's what I was trying to say, because all the patient doesn't know what to expect anyway. I mean, the patient wouldn't know whether it was like clean Well these are the criteria leaves for tests and investigations for tests and investigations, for example good facilities, up-to-date working equipment, nice staff, competent qualified staff Well I'm not nice. written and verbal information, appropriate tests, no complications . But not necessarily the procedure itself. If you, if you were the patient you might say it's wrong because erm she doesn't look like she knows what she's doing or there's a mistake or something gets missed. Yeah. You know. But I mean, on that, well I think it's Well I think the whole point of it is erm, the patient's not gonna know that I'm, first of all, not gonna know anything about nurses, Yeah. Because he didn't, he stayed cos they class him as an A person. And he might take a personal dislike to one of nurses. Yeah. They can only evaluate the care that they've had can't they? At the end of their stay. Whether they, they feel, they feel better and whether that's because the nurses have done a good job or not. So ideally, er Nurses can, they can only they can only say evaluate a certain proportion of the erm Yeah. things in question. Well it says for the nurses to is to be able to evaluate. Waiting list monitoring, outpatient department review, observation, visits erm nursing audit, medical audit, care review, qualifications check . Well you see the bit about the waiting You know it's all very list right? Mm. That's one thing here, will get them in and out, but I've spoken to patients who say they don't get the care here and, on the surface it looks a brilliant hospital, it gets them in and out, you know, it does everything, it's got all the facilities but it doesn't give them the care. Mm. I think the biggest bogey is, is where That's right. it says,quality can only be assured if both patient's view and care-giver's view are in agreement cos that's gonna be really hard to achieve isn't it? Yeah. Where's it say that? Make sure I've written it down. Yes, but quality doesn't just co erm, take into account the care that's given, it takes into erm, what equipment you've got on, whether th er, the equipment's used properly. I mean, but that that is what I was pointing out and we have some, say you have somebody qualified to go and visit each patient What the hell's a ? even just to like I feel we're doing the research do you know what I mean? Mhm. Mm. Yeah. I will say that. What about yours Neil? Come on Neily. Hang on, I've lost my, my work. back too soon. That's wishful thinking. Wears my out. I've got my husband's on. What? Socks . Not the same ones as yesterday? No, I've got about five, no I've got about four pairs the same. Two pairs of blue and two pairs of red. You mean your husband's got four pairs? Well Mm. Right. My art Thirteen centre. My Sorry. my article's about raising the standards of health care in the hospitals. It's all the same really. And it, it looks upon nurses feel about their own standard of care and, the article then goes on about Standard they provide? standard they provide for Mm. the patients. And then the it goes on about setting up the single but dynamic standards a setting system it's called, divided into local level groups like a tier system, you get the Managing Director on the top and the ones at the bottom. And they're called quality assurance, or standard setting teams made up of volunteers from the local wards. The main base made up of volunteers from the local wards like nurses and well I mean nurses and auxiliaries like that. But it's bring, it says things about care and assessing that quality care's being met on their ward and the hospital itself and about once every six months to meet up with other hos members of other hospitals in the area and discuss different aspects of raising the standards of care. And the introduction about about care is passed up the three tiers, like a triangular system's Mm. passed up a three tier system. And if the ideas are good then er incorporated into the care, they're incorporated into the hospital's manifesto if you want, if you like. But there's one one fault really it takes approximately fifteen to eighteen months for them to pass anything like that and that could be one Downfall. downfall, one criticism about Yeah, cos this one says it's immediate. Yeah. Well this one takes fifteen to eighteen months and that's to me that's just ridiculous really. And then, it would take another however to implement any changes that they decided upon. Basically they, they just provide the ideas which get passed They provide the er to the top of the ladder That's it. and then And they're the ones in the situation so they get pa they're the ones who are actually on the ward at the bottom and then pass it up. It's like Yeah. being in parliament really, you have to pass everything up. Well the thing is though people at the top don't necessarily see the problems that you see as problems No they don't, no. as being problems do they? That's probably why it takes fifteen to eighteen months to get a a result. To get there. It's not gonna help the patient like, at the time, like, at the time if your patient complains, something will be done. What happens there and then? If your patient complained, like, I dunno Probably be dead by the time Gone out the window! Yeah! What if you've got a loved one? And, and we sort of no yours doesn't necessarily apply to some people to say, they might just think, oh it'll be I know. good idea to Just what you think. Yes, by the time it comes to getting round to your complaint you've moved on. Mm mm. It's unbelievable how many they . So is that it basically? If you want to call an issue but I was on about setting up these committees to assess the standard of care. I've got a bit like that, and says the erm quality assurance systems will have to be different in each health district, with like being variations. But it says, it has identified key elements, and one of those elements is a Director of Quality Assurance should Yeah. be appointed with responsibility for setting up the district-wide programme. She would receive minutes of all meetings and have the right to attend these meetings to provide a quality assurance input. So that's the same And like I must have got the er the review board should be er six six requirements for these groups. Mm mm. They must voluntary to the whole . Right. Erm, there must be more than six people. There must be a meeting once every three or four weeks for one and a half hours. And the meeting should be held in a place where it is possible to work in our situation. And a leader should be appointed. Yeah. Yeah, but even with all those things in their favour it still takes fifteen months? It still takes fifteen to eighteen months to deliver to pass But the leaders are nearly always someone like a Director of Nursing or somebody like that, who has no ward experience But you need somebody higher up on a day to day to be able to pass these bills doesn't it? To be able to pass the , yeah, try to get them to pass it. Right. It cannot be get background. Mhm. Mm. So, the major criticism for that is higher Is up Fifteen up. high. to eighteen months. Lyndsey. Fifteen months minimum. I think I had it once before. What? I just you know, I'm not sure. I know. I think so. Well, when you've got five minutes come and knock 's door . Well as long as you know about yours and then when she does direct the question at you about that particular Shall I tell you what mine's about? Well I've told you what mine's about. Shut up! You're gonna get this too. Mm mm. It's about a two different tools. A tool being? My body is my tool! Whatever you like. One's called the monitor and one's called called the system . There you are. That's all we need to know is it? Right. Well you could even call it a system. Somewhere. Can we go home now? We may as well get cracking with research mightn't we? Well, we're waiting for these lot. Ah! Can we start when the others come back? Sure can. Can we start now? Why have we covered before the others come back ? Then we'll get out five minutes early and we'll see a bit more of Eastenders. I can't afford to wait. I'm gonna have to vote at seven o'clock on Thursday morning. I'm gonna have to vote as well, I dunno who the hell I'm voting for. Me too. I don't. You're gonna contact everyone Why? else. Because Ah! In the erm I haven't, I haven't gotta vote any more In the Nursing Times it tells you the N H S manifestos for each party. Does it? Mhm. Where? Last week. Oh! Mhm. The thing is, I mean we're hardly to getting to grips with other people . But the thing is, there's been that many changes now, so having a bloody Labour government is just gonna be back to square one and into reverse you know, and go back. Oh God! I wan I don't want him as Prime Minister. Oh! Not . You know, I am fed up! Last night Channel one Yeah. election channel two some bloody crap! Channel three, election channel four, election. And that's just on telly. I said turn that Yeah,. rubbish off! I mean you had John Major on one side, Paddy Ashdown on the other, Neil Kinnock on the other. Paddy Ashdown's the only one worth listening to. I mean Neil, Neil Kinnock for God's sake! he's a wanker! I know. Let's not talk about . It's election constantly on the telly. Six o'clock News is extended. Mm. They have they have extended from six o'clock till quarter to seven and then Have you noticed that when there's a general election you have about five minutes of news there's never any di and disasters like thirty five minutes of bloody election coverage! Probably is, but it's not Vote Bean! Why don't they have a big old disaster and see if they feature it on the news Well they wouldn't. It would have two minutes at the end! It makes you wonder what news Well there is to tell you! a runaway train has run straight through And we're gonna need your head. Yeah. Well last night er And there's been an earthquake and everything there's the everybody's dead. Vote Paddy Ashdown. there's been eight miners trapped down in Yorkshire but the election Cos you know what he does? He always says, and we're the party that doesn't quarrel! Bloody hell! What hell what an excuse is that ? And they always say the same things and you think, oh you told us that yesterday. No I'm not voting for him, he's had an affair. That's the only thing he's got going for him. Who's voting for Tory here? I might. Me, no. Anyone else? I'm sorry. I think I will. I think I will and all. Lesley goes by the majority. No! I wo no! No! I'm not going by No ! the No! majority. I mean, could you live with Neil Kinnock Prime Minister? He's a No. pillock! Anyway, John Major's the You mean you could? only English one. Tell you what, I prefer Maggie Thatcher back. Where's er where's Yeah. Paddy Ashdown from like? He's er Irish. From Galway I think he is. He's a Paddy. He is Irish. Ooh! Well I didn't ne it could be Patrick. Well, that's Irish. If Patrick's Irish, it's called Paddy doesn't it? Not necessarily. Well it doesn't! Not much. Tony's dad's called Patrick and he's not Irish. I never said he was, I just said that he's called Paddy. I don't agree. Like a . Called Paddy O' really. It doesn't mean he's not Irish. Paddy O' . Oh! Now Alison I reckon we should all vote for Mr Bean! I would rather vote for Bruce myself. Mr Bean! The greedy party. Who you voting for? Jane, you don't have to go to Ireland to vote do you? Oh right Her laugh! Ah! Com come on there. Everybody's that bad. No I mean, that was so funny how he taking this . I think he's funny, that's why Well I don't think it's as funny really. I mean, I think a lot of people wouldn't do that . Yeah . Are you gonna move back a bit missus? Why? Please. I'll not be able to see the board. I think I'd rather, rather vote for Bruce . Who's he? He sings, I wanna be elected. I don't give a damn really! Is unity possible? Well is it? Bloody hell! What's that for? Ah yes, but I did it like, like that though. Are you revising for that? We did that yesterday? I can't remember writing that. You did. Yeah. I remember writing that. No. Yeah. That's what I said. More pain and more And it began with A? Yes. Did the research and that. Do all You made it up? I think this model's er That's amazing! erm I'm impressed! I know. I'll, I think it'll be on the Well that's all we did. and everything man. See what we'll be doing. So Er so was I, even though I failed them. I have got a bit about it. Communication is one of those things that I'm not I'm not very confident about this one. Oh! I'm not. Well I'm going to work at Guild Hall. I was gonna Oh! Lucky you! I wish I was going to work. I'll have no excuse. I all these stubs and things! It's like, tell us what's in the software. Er Come on Bedge! So you're tell him off! Good job we ran this innit? Yeah, if it'll . Now what was the file you called when you ran sa when you ran stat I called it stat I'm sure I did. No. Put it in the box. In there. Hang on. Kick the mother fucker! No, woh! No, hang on! Hang on a sec ! I just wanna see if it's been erased since we've been digging around. Probably has you see. Right, okay. Point select. Forwards er No airline! Why don't you run with airlines on all the time? Well I've got confused! Well if i if it comes up and tells me there's no airlines there, then I can assume that there's no airlines! That's right! It didn't! It said there was zero air , that means th there's none there. What do you mean none there? Well there's one there now cos we just connected it. If you a, right I reckon what's happened, you've done a delete on a signal at some point right? And it hasn't been pulled up on the airline? No, you've when you do a delete erm if you do con ex signal, if you have that on signal it deletes the whole signal, airlines and all. I always have it on sig as much as poss . It defaults the sig That's, that's usually what happens. Anyway that doesn't solve the problem now anyway! Oh my God! So we gotta do the bloody thing again anyway! Yeah. Do you want me to put this one in or do you want the other one to go in? I wasn't told! ! Well I I mean I was, I was relying on the, on the . It's, erm, didn't you do these things like erm join the numbers up when you were a kiddy Yeah. You know, in these little books? It's just like that. That says that said to me zero airline so I thought ah great, it's all connected! You know? Well the con activity test told you it wasn't! Well I hadn't got through that had I? I would have discovered once I'd been through it all. Good Lord! Ooh no! Ooh no! That one's get it like that red well that number's moved. Yeah. It goes blue, green, blue, green, blue That's a bit of alive. Hang on! Blue, blue, green Boo ber ber ber ber ber . Right, that's green. Blue. We bring that one red down there. Doo doo . Move these around. We can go no we can't cos of that. This'll be a good one! Do you want to do it? Yeah, I can do it. ? Ow I mean we might as well pitch it now. Pitch those plots. Hang on a sec ! Wha what's happening here? That can come right down here and then blue underneath. Pull that one down. Well I just wondered why it goes there, in It could go down one couldn't it? It goes hold that. Well it's as broad as it's long really. Mm. That just says a bit. Mm, no. It just means changing it. This is the same thing though? Yeah. A bit devious isn't he? One things gone down there. Well Mark did it didn't he! Well the problem is, is that you don't like teeing off do you? Don't like teeing off signals. It's gotta be Yeah, you could of done come off at a pin. So Yeah but you could of come across Well I couldn't from there I remember working on that one and I did it because all this lot was a ,. I just pulled it up from that bottom. Probably this again. Oh but you see It's alright, look I mean that one Hang on! Yeah, but I mean that one you could of shifted this lot put some kinks in this one a bit, right? Moved all that lot up. Yeah but I don't like putting kinks in! You could of gone round with the kinks It's horrible! The kinks Well yeah but it's better tha , I mean that's that's like a bus signal and that's like a ser ,this one that's going round. Is that now? That straight? What you doing? That straight? What's straight? That light. Which one? That one. That one isn't. I know that one isn't! That it's an zoom delete it. This is difficult really. They're gone now. Look! Look at that! Alright! Don't fuck about! Oh no Mrs! Oh No! Gotta go! No. It's gotta go! No. You don't think ahead that's the trouble! I do! You're a cunt Bedge! Patronising bastard! You gotta think head! I think head everyday! You've left a C print on there. Hang on! You've left a It's alright! C pri I'm getting the poxy bloody grid! I why do I have to work with that grid? Cos you can see what you're doing then. Oh! No, it's all naughty and I find the horrible! if you have the grid on you don't miss airlines. I believe you! There's a segment there left! You just make sure What the hell did that jump across there for? There's a fucking segment on there! I told you there's a bloody segment, and does he listen? No! He well he never listens He just goes and clicks the bloody buttons! he never listens to you anyway Bedge ! Look! If the Ah it's still a bloody segment innit? my God! That's awful isn't it? Ah! And look at that! Look at these D L C's you put in there look! That's gone, right! Let's just do board delete that'll probably help won't it? Okay, so I'm coming from here You delete up to there! What's that? Oh it's the big airlines. Yeah, yeah, that's the one yeah, right. Ah like a bloody I'll leave you at it! I'm glad to hear it! God! Run you over! I'll get it sorted and I will do it again! Cor, I dunno ! Look Dave, look! Clever boy! Charge up my batteries cos of my aeroplanes. Oh you're into Got my charger. aeroplanes are you? I'm into model aeroplanes, yes. Oh dear! Well , not recently but I'm hoping to get back to it. When I er when I get the time. Yes, yes. I'll have to From the Hollies take . the Hollies Yeah. Well the trouble is they're so small now aren't they? Yeah. Because they restricted the area so much if you got a big plane that like, to by pass now. It's all gone again now. There was one Don't have a lot of time to think,You know ! there was one bloke over in erm tha you know, with a man la , that I used to work with and he, he used to fly from Hollies , and he lost his plane one day and fle , flew out of range and er he he spent weeks looking for it! Couldn't find! Because th the the sort of corn and barley would, was er was almost ready for Bloody! er harvesting, and he was frightened that he was getting a bit panicky cos if, you know, frightened a combine had had run over it. So But he went and hired and plane from Richmond Airport Oh God! Must of And th cost him a fortune! this guy flew him round and he saw it! He spotted it from there and he wen , went and got it. Probably cost him twice the amount! To hire a plane than the thing's worth! Well yeah! I have heard cases of erm planes being lost in in er crops chu chur churned up! Mm. Farmers aren't happy ! No I know. But there's a couple of guys in another division over there that they were quite keen on er aircraft and they spent weeks building these bloody things and then er, and experienced flyer he'd taken over to the other, other side of the estate when he had a bit of runway over there Aha. and fly them, and they usually flew for about ten seconds and he smashed it! And they came back for another fortnight of re-building ! He said I saw too much! Where's that bloody kettle? Two weeks after he'd said Haven't we ten second flight! Hasn't Yunny put the kettle on yet? He's just gone. He's just gone What a to get it. what a lazy bastard! I'll bloody steal his notes Yeah, when I first I used to fly, actually screen flying. Mm. Tremendous you know! I had this plane a a low four nine engine and I was only a kid. I bought it in village in Mark's Wood I used to take it up the runway and Yeah. took off and I was circle ground, it was quite a windy day then this stood there with me , had no control over the thing, like! And it er I think I think the engine cut at about Well Norm is stepping outside. Is he? Oh! Is he? Yeah. Ooh, my God ! I'm a man myself, ha? But er, is he though? Erm yeah er e , I couldn't hit, you know, just went outside and er what was this? Er, I went out the next day to go to er th yeah that was a Sunday I lost it. And before I went to school on the Monday, drove back down the marsh and went in this forest trying to find it. And we went round this estate can't remember where it was and erm thought knock on the doors and se , ask people had seen it and then later in the day this woman phoned up and said she saw a couple of kids walk down the road with it and sort of ca , called them over and said oh I heard that his, his . So I got it back. That was lucky! And it wasn't broken! I was Yeah? absolutely flabbergasted! That was a bit lucky! Could of been a gonner there! Could of been indeed. Drink? Well drop one, they're still looking. They're still looking. No, I I got plenty of time, I'm not in a hurry. Cos I I got plenty of time. Still looking. Is there still the news about carrying here? Oh I could do. I I I I think that's one of the options that I could sort of er I could still be the li , cleaner over here. If I ain't got a job by June I could still be here cleaning. You gotta take a pay cut then? Oh yeah well er well wo I'd take a pay cut because erm well I'd have to take a pay cut anyway, but the thing is though, with my pension with my pension from day one I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway. If I can take home a hundred and twenty quid well with my seventy pound a week pension two hundred quid. So I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway. I mean, sort of er you know Well, it sounds alright. Probably make a bit more hours, and course there might be er a a couple of hours a night, it'll probably be I reckon it'll probably from five to about er seven. The proper hours. And thing I suppose. Well the thing is, I don't think they're gonna put stran , they're not gonna put a stranger over here. Who don't know the job. Well, it's a bit risky for security as well isn't it? Well yeah! They're not gonna put, they're not gonna put a stranger over here are they? Really? I mean they're gonna you know? I mean, if I sort of just stay for a, for a while but er I've still keep looking for work looking for a job cos I do wanna get away from B T. The sooner I get away the better! But I'm not in a hurry at the moment. So I can't go anywhere anyway. I wanna erm hopefully er hopefully I can get myself a car once I get the money. Buy one. Weren't gonna splash it all out you know? All at once? No I wouldn't splash it all out but I'd get quite a bit cos of the twenty years. I've still got my, er get a car for about a couple of grand. Get a second hand car for a couple of grand and er I'll still have a little bit. We might pay some of the mortgage off and er er, if there's any you know, we sort of keep some in there. Keep some in the Yeah. building society. At least, at least if I had another job you see and er well I'm taking home two hundred odd two hundred pound a week. Well I worked out a hundred and twenty here and seventy pound pension. I wouldn't need to touch that money. That'd still be erm that'd still be in the er still be in the building society could be making me money. Yeah. I mean er You get some er the old interest There's the can't you? Well especially if you put it in your high interest. Yeah. Which once I've wo , which I will. The trouble is with high interest account you can't get the money out very quickly can you? Ah? You can't get the money out very quickly. Just give them plenty of notice like er a month's notice to get the money out. Oh well, yeah. That er So if you need it in a hurry it can be a problem. Yeah. Well we could have it in a ordinary account it's sa , still sort of er . You know? Just report or not. I might be able to some in er, in the ordinary account and some in the high interest account. Yeah. You could do that can't you? Oh yeah, split it up as you like! Oh! Oh yeah, but er but I'm not in a hurry anyway. I've got plenty of time. John! Right. Your tea cup got . How dare you ! Phone! Okay, boy Oy, slaphead! Me? Yeah, the chap from Arkworth Generation for you. Excellent! I'm not sure this machine the actual driver board can I know. Yeah. Because I've been trying to swop between that one and that one. In that we see the one coloured drive right? Yeah. We can re resist the and run from to that copy. When Bedge got it in I say look le I I wanna swop it see what happen. And I took, he swop it he he wouldn't three sixty two. No. I'm not sure, is it the driver that's the problem or not? So you may have to ask Norman if it'll now work. I think we will blame the or th all got in, got in. We will have some money left behind not a lot. Cos the machines in my old office all of them, all the five and a quarters agree both types. And the three and a halfs agreed with seven twenties. Yeah. Yeah! I mean this one can I mean what is what's the point in a, in a drive that'll rig one point two but not three sixty? Useless! And erm the one I got, in there can rig well three sixty K and one point two meg, no problem! As soon as I charge straight into here, what happen with it? I think it's something to with the, with the actual er driver board. Yeah. And you get all set one wha erm setting. You gonna have, you can't have a few. So we may have a, quite another a board or what? I don't know. They will let you know. They'll have to! If I could get my . Then I could have that machine and Justy can have mine. One. What I'm trying to say is that yo ,i now you gotta order another to , forty six. How do I know what's having ? Who's getting the other one then? I dunno. Mm. I have a lot of feeling right? That's it's . When these boys has come along and Colin would he look at John and what do boys say? Well he can't have yours cos he's not doing compiling that No. needs fast processing time. Tony is the one who will definitely jump up and fucking , but I tell him to fuck off! But Colin I mean Frank said to you you can have Yeah. cos you need it for your work! Yeah, but Frank did tell me to keep it, keep quiet! Don't make any don't make war! I don't know it, so I keep quiet. Don't make Yeah but as soon as he walks in here he'll go, ah new machine! Yeah. How's that then? Well you'll have to convince that it's, it's just a three eight six. Cor God! That amazes me why people, it's like a status symbol they have to have the best bloody machine! Well there's no point! But, I have Bedgey look to be honest right he do more compiling than me. If he want the forty six , I mean the forty six I give you this. And he, and he say ah no, but it's alright I got my . But, he said if if Franky order another one he say, I shall have a forty six. Be , originally they order two forty sixes one for Colin and one for Andy. Mm. But when the money tight and they, they can't get the bloody thing! Yeah, well you haven't got it yet anyway have you so Well, I will, I will get it and all the will come in here and we'll hide it or whereby no no, no one will fucking see it! And go, I set it up all working and there's fuck oh ho! It is isn't it? Oh what a pity! Can you stick in that box? But the thing is, they look so different. Don't they? And like Ian's four eight sixes, it's so different to one of those it's not like you can get away with it. Completely different, re-designed box and everything. You still using that monitor? No. Wo , have a look at this monitor? Ay? Come here, it's your monitor, everything. So I can have that monitor with that machine, ha? Yeah, you, you can get everything. Oh right. But we asked erm Colin,di did he want a monitor? And he say no! Mm. Th , the super V G A is better than the, just the V G A. They can give you twe , two hundred two hundred and er, fifty six colour. So Is this V G A or E G A? That's a Philips, a V G A. Is it? It's a normal, it's like your one, it's normal V G A. Oh! Sixteen colour. If you open tha ,ma my window, the picture is compared with the wha you put in there . Oh yeah. So I don't know what is going on! So I'm not over exciting . A Bloody politics place ! Well you got a valid reason for having a fast machine. Right! I better get the out then. And my bloody ! Ow! Well, and I put an order in to buying erm two more of these five and a quarter inch. It'll rebo Mm? That will,wi tha tha will rebo soft. Yeah, but I think th , probably the thing with number Then the driver innit? Well if it can't, it can't. Yeah well there's a problem with that because they might be on different project number mighten they? Yeah but doesn't matter! In this group, doesn't matter. In other group, maybe. Mm. In this group ,. So if you want a se see er er a normal reception you want some some level if you want what? One. If you wanna thick one want a monitor this way,, but not a lot. So you don't wanna put all that in. But it does or some order. But whereas anyone order from this company say well what do you want? Do you want a big one or a small one? If you want a huge order oh you can look for your own. When Len sent them a five pound order, or ten pound Mm. you can leave that . Th there is a if there is work in our group, no problem! As soon as we've been , all been We'll have to write that one with a indelible pen. Yes. You only get on go at it as well. So that is I dunno, you get it off with spirit I suppose. Maybe, I think you can get erm erm in, what they done on Norman's they're using a tape. A tape? Oh that's messy! Er well if you're gonna draw the line I mean I mean it's bloody we know what who's in, who's out. Yeah. Yeah, have a chat with Norman. Okay. The only problem is, I dunno if there's a mistake on this but this modem box right? Is one six one and this is it's ha! You're hoping! Yeah. It's not going into anything is it? No, it isn't, it's not got a socket or anything right? It'll have Norm! Yeah. it'll have four How do you change Look likes the actual box is one six one, this is one sixty right? Yeah. Cos I put erm So that's gonna be a bit small, but a dimension in there. we're not gonna have these connectors on so we all can do whatever size we want really can't we? Yeah. Talk to me! Cli ,wha what's the depth? The depth is erm six four one. four one. So how big's that? That will take us is it clear up Oh right! to there, to here. Erm Yeah, okay. Well what we can do No, what we'll do first ride is put in a connector, you know those connectors? Yeah. That these fellers are on? Yeah. You can get them with long pins each si have them standing up the board and then you have another board, a board with a so you can That's what I was saying! cut the pillars those there. Perhaps, yeah we might find that by the time we got to might not be able to get it all on. Cos that is like a sixth of the area isn't it? What we'll do alright? Mhm. I reckon . If we erm I'll get a if I got time today. Alright? Yeah, so basically Then, yeah, we'll just try and get through today. Start , see what the actually gonna do. Yeah, like , yeah? I mean all the chips will fit, but you gotta . Am I that boring Frank? I didn't Yeah ! say anything you know! No, not half! I didn't. But I di , I didn't realise that I thought you were actually. How old did you think I am? What an insult! Erm He's not that old are you? No, no . I suppose about be erm fifty nine. No, no no no, I'm . Erm, so you had to have didn't you? Erm, I , yes. Yeah,yo , we well we won't do that . Erm, I probably do all that but I don't . How are you? Fine, thank you. I've got a Find your headache, but Surviving? I feel a lot better. Oh well. I went for a walk out this morning but I just couldn't stand it. No. it's no good I'm gonna have to go out for a breath of fresh air. I'm better going do you? But I've got to be honest with you you know. No So he says I'm going out I said oh I feel I'm going out for half an hour that's all. Yeah I can't see the pleasure you know. So you seem a lot better Got a lot of washing to do lie down Yeah he'd like that. Yeah, he'd like that. I know but I thought So I've bit busy with other things anyway.

See I don't feel as I did last night but it's still there, you know I just take some more tablets like, you know. Yeah. But er Nearly getting rid of it but I've really cracked it and it's bloody awful! It does No oh aye, it does. Really cold, really, it's horrible! We didn't do him any good at all. Telling me he got six points for a driving convic for er speeding conviction Halfords I should think Oh right! When he got erm Oh Smell it. See if it smells alright Got any Oh We have to that's why Aye Mm Too much I got your er table things. They do them in packs of fifty but in Oh a split pack I got sixty. That should be enough, shouldn't it? Oh Or did I get seventy? I think I got seventy just to be sure. I thought sixty Oh alright. That's alright. was enough so I got seventy Oh right. cos there's only fifty Yeah. So I got seventy. As I said, they do, they must do them themselves and sell Oh right. They've got a well in that shop. Oh have they? Yeah. It's all bricked up. What else you've been doing? Oh I've done a bit of drawing. you wanna get your hair cut while you're there Yeah. Yeah, I ought to go and get changed Yeah, well don't stand about Yeah, that's alight. I'll get Oh yes. changed. I'll just leave them ticking over then? Yeah. I won't be long. Yeah, okay. Just go and get myself changed. Yeah, I mean you see works' vans all over the place regular. Yeah. Naughty boys! I never thought about that. ha oh. Not if they keep his licence. No. Speeding. Dangerous driving. Dangerous driving cos he made the old woman give over and overtook somewhere totally stupid and probably find he had no brake. He was slowing down anyway! What are we gonna do? It's spitting and spotting innit? Yeah. Fancy having another cup of tea? Yeah. That's if you look at it, like, you only get two chances at speeding now. Mm. Which is harder than it used to be. Must've been four then wasn't it? Yeah. Three points Like you get four gos. Yeah, that'd be right. Get one more go than you used to now you get one left. Tightened up on that, haven't they? Mm. Don't half your er insurance now, don't it? You get Yep. a speeding doesn't, never did anyway, bother them. No. Not unless you had a dangerous driving or something with it. But er losing your licence always has bothered them, hadn't it? Mm. That's always cost you. is there? A very old Granada Mm. way back Aye. Ah, yes it is Yeah. Yeah. Probably buy Hundred quid. Hundred quid Yeah. Aye. And he had a dangerous driving or a speeding I think it is Mm. horrendous insurance bill He says I can't afford scrap. Cost him more. Cost him about six or seven hundred quid a year. Cheaper to buy a blimming er cheaper to insure a car wouldn't it? Mm. Oh no matter what he gets, it's always over five hundred quid cos he's he's Yeah. lost his licence in the past and you know, when he was a kid like Mm. and all that Takes a long while before they forget about that, doesn't it? Yeah. Making himself an extra five hundred pound a year for er having been a naughty boy when he was a teenager. Mm. That's what it's about now, innit? Yeah. It's all the He is actually quite sane now though. Yeah, well it's like this fellow that got done for speeding. When did he get done? Er Thur no Wednesday. sat there watching them catch him up he didn't see them before they got him stopped like. Saw them catch him up coming along with all their blue lights thinking . They'd been in er garage at bottom. Mm. Aye. We'd had a little car before he got there. He said are you speaking to the no, no,around town he says, I don't mind doing a bit more, you know, out and about not much about they just sat in the traffic, you know. Mm but erm so had it been a Foxhalls, something about a minute no, he said only for about a mile, that was it. I said oh, about forty seconds and he sort of looked. I says well, at sixty you do a mile in a minute. So I said if it's only for a mile it's going to be well less than a minute at eighty, presuming you were doing more than thereabouts and er that was it. But the car, he'd er he says oh that was funny he says, I blew past him, popped into fourth, I blew past him real easy going up the . Come out at Foxhalls at forty, I think he did. He can come through Foxhall like and he, he'd had to speed up he says and then he says he didn't carry on, like. He hadn't been doing and er reckon he and er think I'm and that was it so right Been driving since he was nineteen two or three months ago, I think it was. I remember him saying once before I don't, I don't know what and er he says it's only a fortnight ago since you know . You get done for, pulled up for speeding or parking or something and you can pay your own fine . So I went home, anybody gonna pay me fine? He says I am gonna cop it off me mother cop it of his mother. You're always going too fast! I told you before! He says me dad al me dad was always speeding he, he used to go mad! Mm. slow down. Yeah obviously watching wasn't, wasn't watching his mirror very hard. He hadn't seen copper trying to get him caught up, I wonder how much he was using mirror when he was overtaking people? Mm, yeah. Whether he was just watching what was coming from the front. Mm saw him coming have to get it cos Neil's mum was cross about it. Oh well he was only just finding out what the rules were. There was a gang of us chatting with him. I come up with six points. That made his day. He says have I got a fixed penalty? I says only got a pink form if you've got a fixed penalty. Know somebody who got one, like. No, only a bloke I've never seen one had one. Yeah, that'd be Richard. Mm only he's got to take his licence and insurance in. As to what happens now he says I've to go to Magistrate's Court so it's just beginning to sink in that it's gonna cost him some brass and it's going to be serious. One of them there was of the opinion who could quite easily lose his licence for it. Like he got done What he do? Run a Chief Constable over? No! No, he got done for speeding. He was over the, over the limit and had a small quantity of drugs with it. Don't think he'd actually taken them but he had as a Mm. possession. They did him about eight hundred pounds in motoring offences Aye. Phew! Speeding while slightly over the limit it was. Him having speed having, having speed . Oh god! Mm Where's today? Dunno. He started to come over, didn't he? Yeah. they don't come any worse get a cup of tea in between, weren't we? Mm. I don't think it would've bothered us when it was spitting and spotting if we'd actually been out there, would it, it's just setting off in it. Aye, yeah. Blue sky! I can see a bit of blue up there. today? No if you were off to do something and being mucked around for the day, innit? Mm Took my a long while ago. Not surprised to see them now. Only ran out a month ago! Just as well so late I've been waiting for to come. I got some here come in this morning she says, they ran out beginning of September last year. We hadn't thought about it. I thought I was late. Mine have been in, oh, I don't know! A good month! Innit? A slightly bigger like a fish box Or what? Lobster pots making a smell. yeah, don't, I know name when it come up like that. Anyway we can sort the problem because you'll take them back a won't you?put them outside your house, creating a smell they were playing up. Pretty fair stack of them I should think, wasn't there? Mhm. Don't know if the son's got out yet. Been doing time. Aye. I don't know They didn't catch him He had an argument with a kid, two or three years ago Aye. and er they set off in hot pursuit. It was in back of a pick-up. Driving through with a shotgun shooting the guy Still in the back of a pick-up shooting over the roof, like? Yeah. Oh! They didn't get him for that one? Blimming good job! No, they just got him for beating somebody. Bloody good job. You'd think after that one they'd have thrown the keys away for that. Mm. The kid hadn't done much Get an extra two years for missing. the kid hadn't done much, I mean it was nowt serious . You know I had a moving traffic accident Yeah wasn't trucking there, you know or owt like that. No sense of humour. Got brought a pushbike wheel the other day. Can you get the cogs off that? Why? Well they go a lot better on that bike of mine. I don't think so. Oh pity. So what you've done to bend the wheel? I haven't. The gaffer knocked somebody off their pushbike, had to buy him a new wheel and some compensation Scrounge the wheel! How do you get them off? He says you go to a pushbike shop and get special tools. Ring spanner things with the Mm. keys on the outside pumps and things on it to I wouldn't bother. A new set of back cogs for bike's only about seven quid. A brand new set and they come with the ra with the, erm free wheel and everything all in like, just screw them on. Go to a pushbike shop they whip them off and whip them on for you you buy, you know, if you go out and buy one then just take wheel with you they'll stick them straight on. Mm that fellow don't go to the police. Lucky to get away with having to buy him a wheel compensation Unusual innit. It's very expensive that's why it's unusual. Sixty nine ninety nine. is that all right? It is done isn't It? why have you got that on your head. What's it doing take it off. Oh yeah. take it off Mm. take it off I don't like it, take it off What? What's wrong with you? What? What? He's bloody mad, he's potty, off his rocker. Where did you get it? Get what? The thing. Well why Well why do you need it, why do you need a towel? Why do you need a towel. Why er why game. Mum and Dad's got it. Come on Mum. Go get in the blooming bath. Why? I'll rewi rewind that actually heard what you say, you must be very naughty and nasty thing to be to your son. I can't have a sweet then. Well you're not give me a sweet an all. Should give me a sweet you know. You should. You're gonna turn it off because I wanna tear you off a strip about something. Me? Yeah. Why? What are we talking about? Mum what's Hamlet about? Pardon? What's Hamlet about? Hamlet? Yes. I don't know much about Shakespeare, the only play I've seen is Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream. to er see Rome and Juliet. Mm. And I think I need to make it up. When is I dunno. Well you better find out then. What do ya mean I alw I'm only saying it cos I got Well no if you can go. You give me the money for it? If it's within reason as I assume it will be. Five Pounds. That's okay. W would it make much difference for you lending me the money. Not a lot. Well there's a quite a bit of difference between five and fifty isn't there and the one thing is for your educational needs and the other I'm so convinced about. Well Yeah. I thought a computer No, but I know that you're dying to have a computer, and if money was no object, then we probably wouldn't hesitate in lending it to you, but really and truly at this moment things are tight and we can't afford to commit ourselves with things unless it's absolutely necessary. Well And that's it, I mean I've made it as plain as I can. That is it and I hate it when you keep on and on nagging. I won't go and see Romeo and Juliet. Well don't go, it's not my fault if you don't pass your exams. All right. Did you watch that animated version that you recorded. Yeah. Does it give you the gist of the story? It,half an hour long. Well I think it's longer than half an hour. They probably should an hour at the most. Given you er erm The film is about hour and five minutes. You can probably have a video of it as long of another version. Well it's does help to see different versions because you see that different people interpret the Why do you Mm? Well it depends on the people who are producing or directing or whatever, so it's all got different ways of doing it. When I was studying I went to Open Air Theatre and I saw a version there on Christopher er what's his name that chubby fellow with the glasses Christopher Biggins that's it. He was playing Puck and when I went to see the Company doing it well they had a completely different way of doing it, they wo they did it really like er a dec you know the the mechanical play, I don't know if you know A Midsummer Night's Dream. They did it in a completely slapstick farce way you know th the men who were dressed up women they balloons and had rosy red cheeks and wigs and things, it was quite different. How they Well that's it, when Shakespeare wrote a play and the text has survived and , but the way of of joshing the people on the way they do it is different every generation and even most of the people in the same generation would would have a different way of doing it. Okay. There's a comedienne erm she apparently was born in Wales. Mhm. Two Ton Tessie O'Shea that's her. Two Ton Tessie? She yeah, that's her her nickname, cos she was quite big and she played the nurse in Romeo and Juliet in the season on Stratford on Avon and she did it using a Welsh accent because she thought Shakespeare, having coming from quite near the Welsh Border Country might well have had might well have had a Welsh nurse. So it didn't matter that Romeo and Juliet is set in Italy. Mm. She did it as she would have thought Shakespeare would have known people and things, you know, she did it like that. Mm. And I remember Amanda seeing a video of Romeo and Juliet And what struck me was that the costumes were all sort of like you see portraits of Elizabethan dress. Now I don't what Italy and those Middle Ages would have been like, that the sort of clothes that were worn. Mhm. But the clothing in that film struck me very much as being like Elizabethan dress. Yeah, I mean now plays of Shakespeare and they're wearing modern dress like those worn at Richard the Third or something and they're wearing well either First or Second World War uniforms. Yes. It was very different then. Yeah, well it's just different directors have different things they want to emphasise in a play and if they want to bring something home or they think that using a certain well like say the way the people are dressed and everything will will have more of an impact, you know will One thing I was wondering about you know they they talk about erm in Shakespeare's works is the language the words he uses, the the sort of poetry of it and the symbolism that's used. Erm do they talk about that at all in your English Literature Yes. Do they show you how you can learn about this, there's a book you know the book I bought you it's got notes in it. Does that help with it? I suppose Pardon? Well you should do. And what about I bought some revision books and things study aids or something for Amanda for her English literature Well I bought them for Amanda and she was doing Romeo and Juliet. So if you look in those you may find there's some help there. Yeah. Is there any more last minute entry for the quiz? Okay, sit, sit still, be quiet and listen to this, you ready?

Treasure Island And carry on just as if er we were proceeding immediately after the proposed excellent introduction and as if the intervening weeks just hadn't occurred. When this matter was discussed at housing committee, I believe it's only last week but it seems a lot longer ago, I spoke at some length about the errors and fallacies in the report arguing against a case that officers have put forward, pointing out mistakes and erroneous conclusions that seem to have been drawn from some very flimsy evidence. I promised members after that erm meeting that er I would bring forward different arguments tonight and that is exactly what I hope to do. I want to speak on only one angle and that is capital. Now most large businesses actually need capital. They need it to finance new projects and which they ultimately hope those projects will bring in a profit on the capital employed. But once employed as capital that money stays there, it's stuck and hopefully it earns money but it's stuck there forever until the sale of that asset is is a achieved. Many companies when needing to finance new projects have to raise more capital. This is often done by obtaining money in the form of loans, venture capital guarantees and that sort of effort. But if those forms of capital aren't available then the business has to raise capital by some other means and this is very often done by liquidated assets that they currently hold and releasing the capital for the new project. So the use of capital is fluid, right, it it's in a state of dynamic equilibrium as a biologist would be prepared to call it. And it is not it is not fixed it is not fixed or in geological terms, petrified. We in this council operate . We in this council operate a housing business with an annual turnover in excess of twenty four million pounds. Anyone who says we are not operating a business is deluding themselves. We have an acknowledged need to invest more capital to provide more housing for the most needy in our population. The way it is at present, we cannot , we cannot get more loot to put into the new project but the bank manager, i.e. the Chancellor of the Exchequer, reminded us a few months ago that the other way of funding our projects he encouraged us to look at our current assets and if possible liquidate some of that asset and fund it, or or use it to fund our new schemes and this Mr Mayor is what we should be doing. We must sell some of our houses and use the money we gain from that to fund the provision of new housing in the City. To miss out on the opportunity afforded to us by the Chancellor of the Exchequer is to deny those in the greatest housing need the opportunity to get decent low cost housing. So my the, in my mind the best way forward is for this council to promote the right to buy and I fully support this motion and I would urge members of this council to ignore the report that comes back from the housing committee. Thank you Mr Mayor. Thank you Mr Mayor erm a week is a quite a long time in housing but er er especially housing finance terms, I mean the system's probably gonna change again by, you know, by that sort of time. I think it's quite remarkable er that Councillor can come along and blindly say, well we've had a report back to housing committee, housing committee's considered this matter and the vast majority of people found it fairly unacceptable but we'll ignore that, we'll ignore that, fine, well I s'pose if you want to ignore it that's fine but I think w we do face here a a key issue and the issue of capital receipts, as you rightly say, is an important one. Now question is whether or not there is a simple ability to realise a capital receipt and use it I think, and if that were true, if what you're saying is true and there was some net gain to be made very easily then I think we would have a hard time, perhaps, refusing what you're saying. But it isn't true. That's the whole point. It is not a simple case that we can run along, sell a few houses, get the capital receipts and suddenly we can go off and have a wonderful programme and replace the assets which we have sold and when we're talking about assets in this case I think there's one crucial difference between us and you and that is we recognise that that isn't just an asset it is a person's home a person's home, that's so important an a I'm, just to talk about it as if it is is something else, y'know, just some petrified lump of cattle, petrified lump of stock money that was doing no good whatsoever, is a nonsense and I think most of us would agree that it is a complete and utter nonsense. Anyway why, why can't we easily use these capital receipts? Well there are a number of reasons, some of which are specific to the Cambridge to the context of this authority. As you will be well aware, as a member of housing committee, we do actually have faced a substantial crisis in terms of the availability of land which we can make available for building, that is one of the problems, possibly a short term problem, but nonetheless one of the problems key ones, which we face here. So we can't just realise the asset, dash out and build a house through a housing association because we have this crucial land problem. Now if our assets if by promoting the right to buy, by having capital receipts we seem to have a large balance building up, there is the distinct risk given the sort of policies that this government has pursued over time of a we will be running a risk there, we don't know what they're going to do, you don't know what they're going to do. But let's face it I mean if a lot of local authorities are in similar sorts of positions and a lot of balances are building up, well the money just might run away mightn't it it's happened before, I think it might happen again. I mean I don't, I don't believe that your government is stupid er it may be immoral on occasions, it may be wrong but I don't believe it's necessarily stupid. They've had a long time to crack a lot of these problems pardon What's the evidence? Well admit I I cannot actually bring an evidence at this point in time to support that er, that er er assertion. So if you were serious about promoting social housing over time what you would be working for is not a stop go economy in housing, not a stopped go regime in terms of halas housing finance, but a stable, a long term commitment towards er er a financial regime that will actually bring that housing through and that is something you have not done. I mean the autumn statement blindly goes a hundred percent to a hundred percent use of capital receipts. It just as go back. Now that's no way no way to run the railway I was gonna say but that's probably probably not the best choice of words in the present circumstances. But it isn't, it isn't a way to actually run a decent social housing programme. We need stability over the medium term at the very least in order to produce the units that we need, not this sort of one minute you're off, one minute you're not and again, if you were serious the resources were already there, there in terms of the capital receipts that people already had. You could've let us use some of that eight, over eight million pounds that we have stuffed away, set aside to actually promote our social housing programme. So basically, I don't think that it is a simple picture of being able to get a capital receipt and go out and use it. There will be occasions where indeed if people ar people in marginal circumstances are encouraged to buy then we will find, as the local authorities, that they will not be able to raise a mortgage in in in the private sector and we will actually have to supply the mortgage ourselves so where's the capital receipt gone? It's disappeared really hasn't it? Because we we've had to provide mortgage. So, time and time again, when you actually look at it, when you actually look at this position that we find ourselves in, there isn't an easy receipt to be made that can be used that actually provided what the business is about. Alright it you wanna call it a business the business is about provide social housing to answer housing need in this town. I don't actually really believe at the end of the day that that is something you that is rightly called business. It is a service, we are engaged in providing a housing service to answer housing need. What we plead with the government all the time is allow us a regime, a financial regime, that is reasonable and stable in order to do that. Let us not be fooled by short termism met by silly schemes that somehow promise an Eldorado which doesn't exist. Thank you. . Erm,. Yes Mr Mayor. I am very intrigued by councillor 's analogy with this counc er count er housing services by this council being a business and the Chancellor of the Exchequer being some kind of bank manager. I mean how many bank managers b force their businesses to sell off their fixed assets at a colossal discount for heavens sake. I mean if this is the way bank managers operate up and down the country no wonder the economy's in a mess. businesses are going bust all the over place. Actually erm although councillor is quite correct that we're providing a service, erm in some ways it would be nice if the government did give us the freedom to operate our business as we choose to do so. We would therefore be able to provide a much better service. Now it's perfectly now the cost er the benefits from sort of marketing right to buy is really very, very dubious erm the government has shown time and again that what it takes then gives with one hand, it takes away with another and the costs are obvious, we are fragmenting our housing stock, we are putting it, we are likely to end up with more and more with a higher proportion of poor properties and erm there's also the risk that if we do really have to be promoting right to buy we're going to have people who are probably not sure whether they can afford to buy their house or aren't sure whether they even want to buy their house. I think they should be in that particular er set of arrangements. Okay I think what we've seen in American politics in the last twenty, twenty years or so is a, an in is er an increasing trivialization of politics the er the mass media, the so called er piranhas er focus on the daily lives of presidents. We know much more about the state of Chelsea's teeth than we do about the state of the nation. We know much more than anyone could possibly want to know about Bill and Hillary's sex life er than we do er about prospects for economic recovery and this has happened to successive American presidents and it happens in part because in the U S the president and his family, and it has been a his so far, the president and his family take the part, not only the part played in England by the prime minister, but also the part played by the monarchy. The president is both head of state and head of government and in that capacity serves to some extent as a symbol of the nation, a focus for loyalty and Americans have a curious capacity for er im imputing to whoever wins the presidential election a set of er outstanding qualities. So that every American president is a sort of half breed, a cross between Daniel Boone and Jesus Christ and that however corrupt and venal a politician he might have been before, once he assumes the White House it is assumed that he changes. They talk about people growing in office always worried about people who think that forty seven year old men can grow, but there you are. Er the, the, the office itself, the trappings of the office transform the man. So even someone as obviously corrupt as Richard Nixon, people started talking about the new Nixon, new Nixon the statesman. They stopped saying, you know, would you buy a used car from this man and started talking about him as the international peacemaker. And this means, or this has an impact, this dual role as head of state and head of government, has an impact on what any president can do. Because a very large part of any president's time is taken up in the ceremonial, in the ritual, in meeting heads of states from other countries, from opening the equivalents of garden fetes, receiving parties of boy scouts, er and whatever else the Queen and her family do these days. Er and that means that the president's attention is both diverted from substantive concerns and it also means the president, there's a limitation on the extent to which the president can appear to be partisan. So the president tries to encapsulate the national interest to embody the common good and he puts forward policies, not in any spirit of er personal or partisan advantage, but simply for the good of the nation. And so you have then a political system in which you, which you have a presidency er faced by a powerful legislature, a president who is not part of legislature but who has to lead the legislature without any significant controls over it a very difficult and demanding task. Erm one of the best known commentators on the American president, a man called Richard Newstat er who's occasionally known as Mr Williams because he's married to er Shirley Williams a clapped-out Social Democratic politician of er yesteryear, erm Richard Newstat once said, well once said many things but er on this particular occasion said that er if you want to know what presidential power is, it is simply the power to persuade and that er when you look for er an American president what you need to look for er is not somebody who is clear minded, far sighted and so on but you need somebody who has the capacity the skill, the talent, to persuade other people to do what he wants them to do. It has to be persuasion because he has few, if any, powers of coercion unlike the British prime minister. Okay well if we look into the development of the presidency what we've seen is a gradually changing conception of the office. Er I said I think in the first lecture, the founding fathers saw the presidency as a check, as a control on the legislature er and er in periods of crisis legislatures find it very difficult to respond. Any group of five hundred and thirty five people find it difficult to agree on a common purpose or a common decision and increasingly, in period of crisis, attention turned to the presidency and presidents were not always willing to supply the leadership er that er the country expected. Erm presidents of the nineteenth century very often took the view that the president was not much more than a sort of constitutional monarch, er a dignified part of the constitution to use er Bagehot's phrase. Erm in the eighteen fifties, in the years immediately preceding the American civil war, the er then American president er was placed under great pressure to do something about the increasing tensions and increasing conflicts between north and south but er he declined to do so. Does anyone remember the president before Abraham Lincoln? Not many people do. Erm his name James Buchanan James Buchanan was asked to do something about the violations of the Fugitive Slave Law, this is the one that returned slaves back to their owners, erm and Buchanan said, I quote wisely limited and restrained as is the president's power under our constitution, he alone can accomplish but little for good or for evil on such a momentous question. After all he is no more than the chief executive officer of government, his province is not to make but to execute the laws. Congress alone has the power to decide whether the present laws can or cannot be amended so as to carry out more effectively the objects of law. Apart from the execution of the laws the executive has no authority to decide what shall be the relations between the federal government and South Carolina, any attempt to do this would be on his part a naked act of usurpation . So you have a very particular view of the constitution, that given by the founding fathers and one which is still in force some seventy eighty years later as America headed towards its most momentous and divisive crisis in its history. Now this is a turning point in, in American history and er cometh the time cometh the man and the man in this case was Abraham Lincoln and Abraham Lincoln took a rather, a rather different line. And I shall quote to you from er a message of Lincoln's to congress in eighteen sixty one and from some of his er private correspondence. if you remember the question that the founding fathers faced was how do you create a government which is strong enough to endure and to defend the nation and defend the country yet a government which is not so strong that it erodes the rights of individuals within it, this is the, the essence of the, the problem of government as, as the founding fathers saw it. During the er civil war Abraham Lincoln er suspended, unilaterally, without consultation, er suspended the writ of habeas corpus who knows what habeas corpus is? Right to a fair trial, any, any advance on that? We must have one lawyer amongst our presence surely. Mhm. It literally, it literally means produce the body only you can't simply, well the difference between a constitutional system and er an arbitrary government is that in arbitrary governments people get arrested and disappear, locked up, throw away the key and worry about it the next generation or after the next er military coup or whatever but in a constitutional government there have to be procedures and one of the safeguards of individual liberty is that if you're ever arrested and detained by law enforcement agencies you have to be produced before a court within a specified period and charged with something. There has to be evidence produced to say why you are being detained and you have a chance to, to refute that evidence. Er as you can imagine in the circumstances of the civil war the government, the federal government, was much vexed about the question of spies and fifth columnists and people er in the, in the northern states er engaged in sabotage and collecting espionage of, of various kinds so er Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus. There were arrests, people were detained er without trial, they weren't charged with anything but on suspicion of being spies for the confederacy. And Lincoln was criticized, attacked for this, that er and he said in response to this the attention of the country has been called to the proposition that one who is sworn as the constitution says to take care that the laws be faithfully executed should himself not violate those laws a fairly reasonable proposition you might think, if your oath says to uphold the law then you start going round breaking the law er something wrong here somewhere methinks. He goes on to say of course federal laws were not being obeyed in the confederacy because they'd rejected the entire panoply of federal laws and Lincoln goes on to point out must they these laws and the confederacy be allowed to to state the question more directly, are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the government itself to go to pieces less that one be violated . So you get the impression here of Lincoln talking about an unusual crisis situation in a letter to one of his mates in eighteen sixty four Lincoln goes on Lincoln goes on to, in his letter to a friend to deny that civil war was fought to, to free the slaves er as a moral crusade, he wants no part of that argument. Lincoln says in a letter to his friend er Hodges in eighteen sixty four, quote I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong and yet I have never understood the presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling and I aver that to this day I have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on slavery. I did understand however that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of that nation of which the constitution is the organic law. Was it possible rhetorical question was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution ? Now here we move in to a bit of Plato always be aware of those who argue by analogy by general law life and limb must be protected yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life can you guess what's coming next?but a life is never wisely given to save a limb . Pretty acute stuff eh? I felt and this is the bit I like, I, I some I, I used to set this at one point in the examination question and ask people to guess which American president said it I'll read, I'll read it to you measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful if indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation just, I'll just get the essence of that,measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful if indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation ninety percent put Richard Nixon er no one put Abraham Lincoln er cos he was one of the good guys right or wrong I assume this ground I could not feel that to the best of my ability I had even tried to preserve the if to save James Buchanan is essentially the Pontius Pilate of American politics he says yes these are very acute problems er and very difficult er and I'd like to help but I'm sorry I can't and I really do have to go off and wash my hands now erm and, you know, you carry on and when you've resolved it tell me what you want me to do and I'll, I'll do it. Lincoln takes the opposite view, Lincoln says here is a crisis the person uniquely placed to deal with major crises in American politics is the president and I, Abe Lincoln, stand forward and I'm prepared to do almost anything if in my judgment it's necessary to preserve the nation and the constitution. So from a view of the president as impotent and ineffective and helpless you have a view of the president as being er the action man, the crisis manager and it's Lincoln's view, the Linc Lin Lincolnian view of the presidency which has survived er an and developed with, with the odd, the odd hark back to a previous, a previous age. And you find successive presidents er claiming some special authority that the constitution doesn't give them but which they, they believe that er a accrues to them by virtue of they're being presidents. One of my favourite presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, president from the early part of the twentieth century and known as the damned cowboy erm you might be interested to know how people become president erm Theodore Roosevelt was an arch imperialist and got very excited about the er war with Spain er America had a s little brief war with Spain at the end of the nineteenth century erm over the possession of Cuba, and erm in eighteen ninety eight, and this aroused great patriotic feelings in all red blooded Americans and especially in Theodore Roosevelt and er er Roosevelt formed his own company of cavalry called the Rough Riders and erm Roosevelt wore glasses and was asthmatic but he had this group called the Rough Riders, sort of early kind of Clint Eastwood stuff, and erm anyway he g he was engaged in the war with Spain er and there was one wonderful moment in the war Spain in which the Spaniards were at the top of a hill called the San Juan hill er and er Teddy, as he was known, of course he gave his name to the teddy bear, did you know that did you? You learn something every day in these lectures. Er Teddy Roosevelt down at the bottom with the Rough Riders the guns at the top of the hill, the horses at the bottom of the hill you've heard of the charge of the Light Brigade haven't you? They were smart guys compared to Teddy Roosevelt. Er Teddy Roosevelt leads a charge of horses up hill, up hill, into the mouth of the Spanish guns smart guy, smart move how did he become president after doing something as fatuous as this? Well fortunately the Spanish were even more incompetent than he was and what the Spanish commander, instead of rubbing his hands at the prospect of er the damage they were about to wreak, he discovered that they had the wrong calibre shells for their guns and Roosevelt and the Rough Riders overran the Spanish guns a and Teddy Roosevelt became a war hero and on the strength of becoming a war hero, he become vice president of the United States, got the vice presidential nomination and in good American fashion the president was shot er by an assassin er and Teddy Roosevelt became president, so there you are, there's a there's a career plan for you to er to think about. Erm Roosevelt was er despite the er rather unusual route to the presidency, really rather a good president but he had a, he had a very particular view of the presidency which was one which he shared with Lincoln but he took up Lincoln's arguments and, and developed it further and I quote from er Roosevelt's autobiography, which is rather more revealing than most autobiographies, erm Roosevelt wasn't modest I should say in case you, if you wonder when I read you something. He says in the autobiography erm my view was that every president was a and this was a famous phrase every president was a steward of the people, a steward of the people, bound actively and affirmatively to do all he could for the people and not to content himself with the negative merit of keeping his talents undamaged in a napkin curious turn of phrase I decline he says to adopt the view that what is imperatively necessary for the nation cannot be done unless the president can find some specific authorization to do it in the constitution. I did and caused to be done many things not previously done by the president. I did not usurp power but I did greatly broaden the use of executive power, in other words this is the modesty part I acted for the public welfare, I acted for the common wellbeing of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was necessary unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative prohibition Roosevelt suggested that the president subject only to the people of the United States and he identified himself with Andrew Jackson and with Abraham Lincoln. To Roosevelt the view propounded by our friend James Buchanan was narrowly legalistic in which the president was the servant not of the people but of congress and this, to Roosevelt, was . So you get, if you like, a development here er of presidential authority and the perception of the presidency both from the point of view of incumbents and from the point of view of the American people and gradually in the twentieth century you get an increasing focus an increasing focus on the presidency as the engine of government, that it's the president who makes things happen, it's the president who fixes things, it's the president who responds to crises and as the crises become more frequent and the crises become more intense so the focus on the president also expands and the Buchanan view is now no longer tenable, the Buchanan view it's not possible for any president to play the dignified monarch. They like to do it a bit but they really can't sustain it because ultimately there's a, there's a call for action, a demand for action. In the twentieth century er the president who did most to, to develop the office further was, was Franklin Roosevelt, Theodore's cousin er and Franklin Roosevelt, who became president in, in the nineteen thirties and the time of the great depression, and remained president for, till nineteen forty five so He was president for thirteen years er and his political opponents were so upset by this that they actually amended the constitution afterwards to prevent any future president from serving more than two terms of as president, so eight years is the maximum that anyone can serve as president. Roosevelt served for thirteen years and led America through the depression, into the second world war and emerging at the other end as Oh well there was clothes and gardens and and just the same as it is now. But oh that's where the Was it the Clydesdale bank that's at the top of Castle Street? Mhm. That was and that was a grand shop. We used to all wear pinnies, white pinnies, on the top of our dresses and going to school and I used to go into old Mr n and he would say to me And what colour of the bow do you want on your pinny today? And I would say He'd wait for me to say, Blue to match my eyes. Just as a kid he would lift me up on the m up on the er counter, you know and me I was born in and then we shifted to the bottom, you know that white house, I think it's all offices now, in the the erm big gates of the cathedral. You know at the bottom of the market green. Well the house, you just went in a gate there and went up the stairs there. So it was just My mother used to see me across the road with my shilling to pay for my pinny. And one day I dro I dropped it down the the drain as I went into the shop. And I tears of course, you know, and er the poor old man he was a very small man, Mr , and er he lifted me up and told me never to mind, i could get another shilling. But I don't know whether I ever got . Or whether I got the pinny for nothing, I might have easy. Yes? Did you have to have a different pinny every day then? Oh very nearly. Oh yes, but they were just things that you tied at the back and and er had a frilled round here They were bonny. On the top of your dress. And what was the pinny for? Oh just dress. You were dressed in a clean one, you had a clean pinny on. You know, just a thing with sleeves and and er han hang loose on you. You've seen pi pictures of that surely. Was that to keep the dress clean? I don't know I think it was just to make us look pretty with a white pinny on the top of our clothes . And did all the bairns wear t All the girls wear these? Oh yes. Nearly every girl. Well when they were tiny anyway. Mhm. Well it must have been an awful job to keep all these white? Oh yes and then we Oh whenever we had anything like picnics or anything like that, we had lovely white dresses that were made of what they called nun's veiling. What could I say it was like? It was a sort of woollen soft material but very er thin. And the ladies all when they were dressed they would have a skirt made of this and a frilly blouse with a high neck and er a silver buckled belt round their waist. Did they wear very tight corset ? Oh mercy yes. Yes my aunt was Mrs David , and goodness me I can remember her having the laces pulled in. just slim waists waists. Big bottoms I always used to say . What sort of things did they have to keep their waists in? They looked terribly tough. Well just corsets like that, and they're fastened on the front with things that clicked in and then sometimes they would have a What they called a Oh what on earth did they call that? It was a thing made of whale bone that they shoved down side without fastening. And there were just as stiff as boards. Did they have to keep that on all day? Oh yes. Well did that not do any damage to their ribs then ? Well you would think so wouldn't you but it Nobody ever to say anything about it. Did did they have to wear lots of Do you remember your aunties or your your mother Did they have to lots of layers of clothes or they seem to be. Yes. And they they they very often, when they were dressed, they would have a little shawl that they would lay over their shoulders instead of a a long scarf thing you know? They'd have a little fancy shawl or My Grandma used to always have a fancy shawl that Just a small thing that came, you know, a bit down their back and And my Grandma used to wear erm a white much It was just thing like a baby's A cotton thing, tied with a just a string, you know just to erm just a tie under her chin and it would have a wee bit of lace s on the corner, or the or the end of the tie, that was through the day and it was all ruffled, and then when she was on holiday and came into town she had a a thing on her head made of velvet and it all had fancy little things in it. Very posh. Did she live in the country? She lived in Deerness. Mhm. Was it a big event to come into Kirkwall Oh yes. My goodness yes. Some some of them were never in t I well I didn't know my aunt when I met her with a hat on. My aunt. There was one time she was all dressed up to go to town and I didn't know her because she had a hat on. I never seen her with a hat on in my life before, but Grandma wore a a bonnet, when she came into town. and Grandma was the same, she had a she had another little fancy hat that she wore. Funny little things then. Did Could everybody afford to have their own horse and gig or or was there a bus that came in or? Oh never such a thing as a bus, was brakes in these days that went to the country. They didn't have a horse bus of any kind, did they? No Well Yes they had what they called brakes that came in. And erm they the w it was a place called diamonds in Deerness. Er Diamonds was the name of the farm or the place and then it came along to the lighthouse corner. New Lighthouse was the name of the house. that was one of mu un uncles that had that house and Well my cousins have it now. And then they set off from there into Kirkwall about What time? About nine o'clock in the morning. And we sat in two rows and two horses pulling at us. And did they have to stop and change the horses? No no. Just you see? No no they didn't do tat. But Granddad had a lovely little What could you call it? A little gig It wasn't a gig either, he did have a gig but he had this thing, a sort of long shaped er What would you call it ? I I've got mixed up with the names of the things. Before my time I think it's Oh by Jove it is. Er and they used to sit in that. Erm two little doors at the Well it's just kind of the shape of What could I say it's the shape of? Well there would be a seat they would be facing each other in their seats. There's a picture of Granddad in in erm that new Orkney book that came out. Erm What's the name of it? What the N David David Stanley had a whole lot of pictures and there's an awful lot of pictures in it belonging to my Granddad and Grandma. We're not in it but me cousins and uncles and aunts and everybody's in it. Is that the the one. The all the old photographs of Orkney I've seen that one. Yes. Yeah. Well if you see an old man sitting there with a a shining fronted cap on you'll know that's me Granddad, in a white beard. Is there any sort of shelter ? Well when No no. No shelter. What happened if it was a pouring day rain ? it must have poured on us but I can't ever remember it raining You know there was when we used to go to Deerness I had very long hair and we And Kirkwall wasn't just the cleanest of place at places at that time. And my hair was gingery, more or less the colour of the map you know, or a little darker than the colour of the map. And when I When it was opened out for me going to Deerness, well that was a great event. Grandma used to always say, Oh I know she's on the bus because I can see her here. And er when I went to school, Miss the old teacher, she used to take me out, er I used to go to the school ready to go to Deerness, we had to ask out a quarter of an hour early. And erm when Because we went the first day of our holidays, right away, to Deerness to my mother's people. And er I had to ask out this quarter of an hour early, well I got me hair all combed out all ready to go you see? But Miss used to take me out into here, to the teachers cloak room and and er er plait my hair up again and s say to me, I'll take it out before you go away Isa, because there was It wasn't a clean place in Kirkwall . Such a thing's never heard of nowad days I don't think. So You said that there wasn't an upstairs downstairs kind of thing at all then? Well I didn't feel it. I never I never had that feeling. We certainly were like being in the army more or less, and er there was the head servants and erm the under servants, you know? But it was er we all sort of had a respect for each other and each other 's jobs, but there was none of this erm upstairs downstairs and running frightened for people or anything like that. We all kept our place but we all It was As I said, just as if they gave you credit for what you could do. It's in er Well how can I describe it to you? But we never were made to feel inferior or er erm anything like that. I never I was never made to feel that way anyway. I just get so annoyed at this English women that wrote that book, Upstairs Downstairs, you certainly th th th We know that the butler and the cook are boss, you know. They're the They're the head ones and they're place in you're sort of in charge. But you don't rub up against that horrible feeling. What was society i in Orkney just before you left, you said you were a young girl and you left about nineteen nineteen. Yes. Was there er was there a big gap in society in Orkney, were there You know were the rich were rich and the poor were poor? Oh yes, dreadful. Far worse than anything I ever met in the south. And er there r there are no real er gentry in Orkney you see, and you'll always find that if anybody gets a a a Well as I said to one boy here, I said to him look here I said your old grandfather worked in that shop till his backside was hanging out his brigs. And I said that's the reason that you can get a car anytime you want it. I said I've lived lo long enough to know that. I said And I always say that it's the Orcad Insert one row and copy and then insert another row and copy. You mean insert Insert formulae? That's right. Over on the other side, erm you're given a range name. You got a formula. You see a range name, erm, average exchange let's say. So you same address divided by average exchange. If you copy that formula down to the cell below, what would you see? Erm. Then whatever cell was below average exchange. Erm, it would jump down one, unless you adding That cell address divided by average exchange. The cell below. You copy it down . It down erm, it would come down a different, the wrong figure. So let's, suppose you had C twenty six divided by average exchange. Copy it down you see. E three divided by average exchange. That's getting on to the right . Yes, not an absolute No. Okay, over to the other side. Erm,erm how do you check whether ho how do you check how much, how big your disk is? What do you type precisely? C H two B S blank Right. Okay. How do you find out what memory you've got? To develop into your spreadsheet? Sorry? Where's your systems ? Data Data status? No. Changed your mind on that. Right. Check disk. No, no that's on the disk. It's, you go into status Another unanimous What the unanimous decision of the team? Worksheet status. Worksheet status. Are you happy with that? Yeah. Happy with that? Yeah. Happy with that? Yeah, Yeah, I'll give you that. Don't put you off. Right, erm how does memory get used in One Two Three, Release Two? Rapidly. It, it may be true, not the answer we need. Is it column blocks? Column blocks. Okay. Bit more. One What's the key thing about memory, how it's used? It uses up all the gaps in between the gaps. The gaps in between. That's what I was after. Right. Okay, how does Release Three and want to check the Windows differ? It doesn't use the gap it doesn't use up the gaps between erm the distance working Big distances. What defines, what's a big distance? That's right, is it? When he fills up the gaps within the five hundred and twelve row blocks he gets. Okay. Er, why can't you use all of your expanded memory? Yeah. out the room. I think it's because it can't address it. I went out next. No, you were all in here at the time. on the phone Oh, were you? Oh, you might have been I but most of you were certainly here. Got as far as you could only use five hundred and forty odd or something was it Saying you could probably only use practically only five hundred K Why? Because your main memory won't take all the expanded memory anyway. Will it? It will only expand, take something Er, I'm not with you, sorry? I'll pass it across. Could you condense some Yes. When your conventional memory runs up, you can't put more into expanded memory. What,wh wh feeling slightly bigger, you get three and a half, but er what goes into conven what goes into conventional memory? What uses up the conventional memory? spreadsheet Well, I can't deny that. like erm,all the extras. The additional things. Er, it wasn't what I was after. certain things to go Yes. Okay. Yes Like formulae and things So what doesn't go into expanded memory, then? Data. It is the actual text the input bit That's supposed to go into the expanded memory. Oh. What did I say, doesn't go into expanded memory? Numbers. Well Labels. It's partly true, but Labels. No. No, I think you're on the wrong track. Is your conventional memory? What does, what what only goes into conventional memory not into expanded? Erm, I'd better tell you. It's the sixteen bytes block. That's the minimum amount of memory that gets used. That is used solely out of conventional. I'll give you half, anyway. Right, er,same again. Erm. If you find yourself running out of memory, and you're working on a spreadsheet for a while, what should you do? Save it and retrieve it. Save it and retrieve it, that's the one, yes. Right, why's that? The other side. . Why should, what does it do, if you save and retrieve? Or what I want to know is but the question is You take anything that you've in that you've erased on it and then put it back in. Yes, when you erase something, it doesn't free up the memory straight away. Okay. Erm, when you erm, erase a cell, with range erase. What do you get rid of? Everything. Just, just typing with any erm You get rid of the format. You get rid of when you do range erase. No, you don't, no you don't. Range erase, you just get rid of what's in the cell. You don't get rid of the format. memory in. Right. Yes, that's right. You don't get rid of the format. Okay, fine very generous there. Er, erm, right. How do you get rid of, what's the best, what did I say was the best way of getting rid of everything out of the cell? Copy it all in to Blank cell. Copy a blank cell. That's blank in what way is it blank? no formula No, no formula and what else is not Not protected. No protect. No labels. No. No protect, is that what you mean? Whatever. top there. There's no what at the top? No Us or No U that be unprotect. Right, and no format. Right, okay. I'll give you that. Erm. How do you get rid of deadwood? You chop What's that? I'll take a guess at you want and then it deadwood exact part of the spreadsheet, Can do. That's one way. How, exactly do you do the extract? Or what menu options do you choose? slash range. So the other question enter extract. File name extract it all in one go. file name Formulae or Oh, values or formula. Values Which of the two? Well, formulae will take the labels and everything. Values will just take the figures. There's no formulae I know that So which one you want then? Formula. Formula. Right. Okey-doke. Alright, I'll give you that. That's one way of doing it. Er, what's an another way. Getting rid of deadwood? Clearing columns and rows. If you've done a diagonal. You should be able to clear all columns the rows to the right of your Oh, right, erase Coming down, yeah all those different ranges Yeah. would you say? Right. Okey-dokey. Erm, I can't think of any questions there. Er, how can you have eight K more memory than most of you seem to have? rather than print the erm Yeah. Without getting the print wrong. How do you One Two Three, Right, that's it. Good. Right. Okey-doke. That's the end of the competition. Picked the right one on that one as well, didn't I? Most of them were wrong on this one Right. I missed some questions out Right. Linking files, copying data from one file to another in various ways. Erm so, there's various methods, we'll go into specific methods in a minute, but er, when you are passing data from one file to another, you ought to use passing and receiving areas. This is the same, in the same way that we had passing and receiving areas, of passing data from one part of a spreadsheet to another part of a spreadsheet. Erm, so you bring all the data down, passing over the simple formulae and then do one copy. So file combine is the method. You've had a look at that before. Combine at range, try and arrange all the files into another file. You only need to one file combine, that's one advantage, instead of three, so it's about three times quicker. But er, there's also an advantage of passing and receiving areas as there is before. Er, all to keep in clear order where information was going to and from. Erm, instead of you can combine directly a range from one file into another file. You can also er, another method, you could while you're working on this file, use extract to save that range of that file to a separate file,and then when you retrieve this file you can com you combine this file here. This small file to there. So you can either go that way or you go direct. Erm, the advantage of this way is it tends to confuse most of the time, but it's a lot quicker. It only takes half a second to save that relatively small range. That small file, and it only takes half a second to combine that relatively small file to there. But it might take half a minute to combine this range from this relatively large file. So in terms of overall computer speed, that method could be quicker, but I don't recommend you use it actually, because it's risky. It's risky in the sense that you change this file. You save it, but you forget to extract that range to a separate file. And then go to this file, and then you combine in this file here to there, and you don't realize it's an old copy. That's a risk, that's where you get the wrong answers. When you, when you expect that that that that takes the copy back in the old file. Oh, it does. When you do file extract, just er, saving part, it's not removing it from this. Its copying it though. Just copying it, yes. Like you do a file save. When you do a file save. Your file doesn't disappear. Right, now, the specific methods, file combine, is one method. Er, file combine has its problems, though. Anybody had any problems with file combine? Yeah. What's the problem you had? the that, sometimes you can get combine figures with, with file display, but it doesn't combine correctly, or edit properly, or edit formulae Formulae. Right that's the problem. Formulae. Er, let's look at this spreadsheet here. I've got an input number there. A number on the grid. In that cell I've got a formula, just multiply the number above by the number of the left. Then got a label and then got another formula in a cell. I want to copy those four numbers into another file. So you each give those four cells a range name, which I have already done. Range name, create data. It's not my normal name if you notice, but the name those four cells data, okey-doke. And er, I'll save the file, and er, I want to copy that data, let's say to here. Put the cell point in there. If I do a file combine and then copy and then just part of the file, so it's name you'll specify the range. What range? It's the range the range name data. So I'll type that in. Now what's the name of the file? Well, the file is called F C V. Press enter, and there's the hundred, that's fine, but this should have a thirty in it, it's got a zero in it. The reason being is that it's copied for formula across, see at the top F eight time E nine, and that formula has gone and recalculated straight away. It's multiplied a hundred above by a blank cell on the left and you get zero. So that's why, it's copied the formulas across. I didn't want the formulae. I was just wanted the numbers menu. There isn't an option unfortunately, erm, er, one potential solution er, which may well work, is to use file, combine add instead of copy, let's have a go with that one. Add main range data file F C V and ah, there we've got the right numbers, a hundred and a thirty. Look in the top left, there's no formulae. Not that we want it, just the number, that's fine. Er, what we haven't got though, is a label there. There was a label in that cell, er file combine add, doesn't copy labels. It doesn't copy formulae, it doesn't copy labels either. But if, if you don't need labels, then file combine add is an acceptable way of coping the data across. I just want to tell you, time I done that done that on a number of spreadsheets compared with the same label on one, on one Yeah, that had a label in the cell, if I had A B C in that cell. If I was to do a file combine add again. File, combine add take range. Take F C V. It doesn't know I've written the A B C, Right. so it, any, whenever I have a cell, put a label in Oh. it or a formula in it. What it also does, as you see, is it adds what you combine combining two of what's on the spreadsheet. So it's got two hundred there now. So before you do a file combine add, you need to erase first, and then do the file combine add. So that it doesn't add the numbers to what's on the screen. Now, if you do want labels, as well as the numbers. What you doing to do? Well, this is the solution. You set recalculation to manual, first. You put a slash, worksheet, global recalculation and manual and then you do your file combine copy again. File. Combine. Copy. Name range. Data, and F C V then file. Right, so there's all the right numbers, and the label. Still copy the formulas across, you notice. But the formulas haven't calculated yet. sorted out in your calculator, as soon as you combine them. What I need to do therefore, is get rid of the formulae, just leave the numbers there. How do you do that? Er, how do I get rid of these formulae, that one and that one, but leave the numbers there? Or some value. Something value, yes. Erm. Range value. Range value, yes, that's it. You do slash range value. It works just like copy does. With one difference. What's the difference? Exactly the same as copy, but there's one difference. The way copy works. copy Anything said at the back. Yes, it is. It doesn't copy the formulae. It doesn't copy the formulae. Yes, that's the difference between copy and range value. So, erm, highlight what you want to copy, which is that, and then ask where do you want to copy to. So where should I copy to? Same place. The same place, that's it. Normally when you copy, you copy somewhere different, er, which I could do, but er, I'm gonna copy it to the same place. So I just press enter. If you copy it to a different place, does it leave the blank formulas In the original place, yes. somewhere else. Use the second one just with the numbers, that's right, yes. But I've copied over to the same place, what it seems to be doing provided the cell pointed out, you're looking at the top left. You don't see the formulae any more, just the number if there's one there. So that's the solution. You set recalculation to manual, do the file from my own copy and then use range value to remove formulae So that's the file combining method. Getting data across We'll go on to another another way of getting data across from one file to another is with a special type of formula. Like this one at the top. If I type that formula in a cell on a spreadsheet. What's the two the name of the file, two greater than the cell address and it er, gets to the data from that cell and that other file. Have you ever done, used these formulae. Anybody used them? By linking formulae. You've used them Linking files together. For linking files together. Right, and there's various pros and cons to be aware of. So that's rather good. So let's demonstrate first of all how they work. I've got a file named sales one. Here it is, and erm, leave these er, on this row er twenty five, I've got a total sales figures, and it's that total sales figure there that I want to pass across into another file. Let me save this file. That's the cell C twenty five that bears the total. I've got a file called income two, and let me just erase what's here first of all. Right, so we'll type a formula into this cell, this is where I want the total sales figure to be. So type plus two less thans, the name of the file, which is sales one, two greater thans, and a cell address, C twenty five and then enter and that number one five four is, you got from that file sales one, in cell C twenty five, and I can copy that formula to the right, just like any other formula, I can copy it. Erm, there we go, and er, we copy right C twenty five E twenty five, that's it. Let me save this file. Letting me go back to the sales file. Have to change some of the numbers. Right, let's save the file. Let's retrieve the, the er, other file back again, and as soon as you retrieve it, updated it,data from the other file. So, as you retrieve it, it's updated the file. That sounds very good. You didn't have to press any buttons, it just did it. Shouldn't that be a range name instead of a cell address? Er, well, yes, we'll come to that. Wh why might you want to do that? of spreadsheets are Sorry? Well, a group of spreadsheets You put re you would want to put range names on the cell. Instead of C twenty five, you have a range name. Is that what you mean? Yeah, well I manually combine at the moment the range names. A number of range names from a number of You file combine? Yeah. Oh, I think what you're trying to say is can you combine a whole range and not just one cell. Right. Well, I'll come back to that. Let me go back to er the inco er the sales file. Let's say we're gonna research a number of products. The product er F write numbers. Here we go. Save it away. Let's retrieve the other one back again the numbers absolute type That's right, erm, I can save it with the row on the other files, but the total is now on row twenty six, but this is still referring to the same cells, C twenty five. Oh. The row twenty five is no now contains a dash blind. Erm, so that's not very good. Erm, at least I spotted it here, and I can rea realize what the problem is. Change that to a twenty six and then copy this er right. But, er, you might not have spotted it, and furthermore, you might have er, referred to another row that contains numbers. Here it was obvious that something was wrong, because you saw a dash. But you could have er, be er could now be referring to a different row that happens to have the same numbers in. Might not seen obviously wrong. So, therefore you get wrong answers. So, this is a big risk with these highlighted formulas, if you do it this way. Of course, we're always going to be inserting and deleting and moving things about, so, er, the risk of this happening will be very high. But there is a solution, and that's to use range names. So let's go back to the file again. Er, I could name that cell with a range name, that cell there, the first cell. range name create, erm, in fact, I've already done it. Th this cell, erm, C twenty six, I've named cell zero one. That cell there. Name cell zero one. Cell zero two. Name that one. E twenty six, I've named zero three, and so on. That's my normal naming convention, my normal naming convention is use the first two letters W L. W I've explained, and L stands for linking. So you have to create a range name for each cell that you're going to link. Let's go back to the other file er, I'm going to put a range name in, cell zero one on that one. Cell zero two on that one. Right, so I, I've put, got the range names on the first two, but not on the others. Let's save this file and then retrieve the er, other one back again. Let's insert yet another product. Type in the numbers save it, retrieve the other one back again. So at least the first two cells are still picking up the right two numbers, because we used the range names, we've inserted a row on the other file, but er, we're still about range names found where those cells are. Whereas here and in that range name it's still referring to row twenty six. So that's the solution. Use the range names when you file formulae. Sorry. I want to erm, go ahead and put files formulae information three files one point one down Yes, Can I do that? yes, you can have diff different opening formulae with a different part name in it. Yes, but no not into the one cell. You have to bring the two separate cells into fourth cell, total number. Yeah. Erm. You can't link a whole range to a whole range, you can only have to one cell. So this a thing you won't like about it, is that if you've got er, thirteen columns and ten rows, that means you have to create hundred and thirty range names, which you won't enjoy doing. Erm, but you really need to do it, cos the risk of things going wrong are very high, you don't Right, let's file I wanted to say a fe a few things about One Two Three Release Three, cos there are some differences on the Windows products. When you retrieve the linked file one two three, release three of four, it doesn't automatically update itself, and it does here. So what do you need to do in order to release three or four? One thing you can do, is do file admin link and that goes and gets the data from the file on the disk. It takes it then. But I don't use it, er, because it's incredibly slow. It can measure it and wait hours. If you've got a, if you're linked to a big file and you got a lot of linking formulae, you can wait hours for it to finish. So you want to avoid it at all costs in release three of four. So what should you do? Well, in release three of four you can have more than one file open at the same time. Let me show you. Here's the first file that I've got, this is the sales file, and, to bring the second file into memory in this, this One Two Three Release Three, you do file open. That leaves this file in memory, but brings another one into memory. Er, might as well move the next one in and that cell's got a file linking formulae which is updated cos of the files in the memory. Let's just create a window, so we can see both files on the screen at the same time. Right, so in the lower window, we've got the sales file, and the upper window we've got the income file. The linking formulae in that cell. If I change a number here, you'll notice,si since I change that number here it recalculates through to the other file. The two files are in memory. When you change one, the other automatically recalculates through. So if you need to pass data across from one file to another in release three or four, they don't convert the files and then they, data transfers across virtually easy Any questions on that. Right, er, we got tea or coffee or a soft drink Ten, fifteen minutes. How long do you need? Well, a little bit about managing your files. Is there a tape recorder in here somewhere? has got it By the wall here. Oh, right. That's why you're quiet over there, is it? So a bit about managing your files. Er, you shouldn't put too many files in one directory, cos then you can't find them, when you're looking for a file. You see a whole list of files you can't retrieve, you get a whole list of appearing. And, er, you probably retrieve half a dozen files before you find the one that you want. Has this happened to you from time to time? You can't remember what you called a certain file, and Yeah. it looks like it might be that one, got to try that one. Not the one. Er, is it this one? No. No, it's not that one. You can retrieve quite a few,wa waste a lot of time, anyway. Erm, what you want to do is to create lots of directories and put different sets of files in different directories. Are you familiar with directories? Yeah. DOS. Making directories. Erm, the analogy is the filing cabinets. Er, you wouldn't have a great big stack of paper in the corner of the room. Well, er, if you did, then if you were looking for something, you couldn't find where it was, you know, you'd have to delve in, and you take ages to find whatever you're looking for. But er, if you file everything away in filing cabinets, then er, you can go to the right filing cabinet, open the right drawer, maybe there's some folders in there. Pick out the right folder, if it's got a tab on it. Then maybe between various other pieces of paper, you find the one that you're after. And, find thing quickly. Erm. So. Erm, you want to put your own computer files in directories in the same way. You ever created a directory? How do you do it? Erm, you have created a sub with DOS. Created a sub-directory, right. In erm, DOS, do you do M D M D, that's right space, back-slash What does M D stand for? Main directory You, if you get the C prompt. You've seen the C prompt, have you? Mhm. And, you wanted to create a, a sub-directory off the root directories known as root directories you would type M D space suppose you wanted to create a directory named put,put your budgets in. Keep them in,press enter. So that creates a sub-directory, off your root directory, called put. You may have a list of directories as well, off the root directory, and then you've got a directory called One Two Three One Two Three programs in. Mhm. And you may have some other directories. Then if you've got one called DOS. Put the DOS programs in there All that, all I can do is pick a file out of my come under One Two Three, but if you do that in Lotus you have to do the one two three first. No, you can create a separate sub-directory. I've got one two three and a black-slash But if you put two three and I put in in the sub-directory. Yeah, that's what I mean, you have to do it on one two three. No. No, when you do make directories, you just put you wouldn't save it into Oh, I think it Saving it into one two three Yes, but once you, once you automatically. Yeah. How do you get into DOS? If you're in One Two Three of that suppose you wanted to make a directory. use it. How do you get into DOS? We have to go out I'd exit out Yeah. You could quit. Yeah. You could do, but then you have to restart One Two Three and re-retrieve your spreadsheet and all the rest of it. If you choose system from the top menu, that puts you into DOS, but it leaves One Two Three there. So you quickly get back so it's pointing at my one two three directory, so if I do M D yeah. if I do M D space put here, it will create a sub-directory, below the one haven't they? They, they are very good they are. Do you hear that . Well you always wanted a piano. Yeah. According your that is. And I wanted, I wanted Conways. I thought you were going to put that low so that if so that if this did pick it up er it didn't make any difference. Mm. You sit in there. Don't sit on there. I wish I could er well don't, don't you know, that's a record case there! Well we always clean, the carpet's clean! What when people walk in dirt? No! And you go out and you ca That's finished anyway. Have you got another tape ready. I can do, I think, stop it. How many more have you got left from the Christmas box tapes? Two, four two or four I should think. This one here, I think that's been play , that's been played on. I told you to keep the new ones separate. You'll get them all mixed up! See how it goes. They are. Oh. Good! Oh! What's that? Nothing. Baker Conway, he's is a we wanted one of his things. Yes. And you got him now for nothing. I think he went on a liner. Well he did! And then Well all of his and erm one of them lost th use of his fingers. It wasn't when they I think that was him. Probably was. I wish I'd have carried on with piano lessons. But then we used to se Your mum must have read that little finger. Then we used to sniff, you know, and Mrs come and knocked on the front door says er, our house is asleep do you mind not playing, you know. Cos er there were only four and a half inch divide in brick walls. Mm. Yeah! Mm. So I mean not double. These er, these mi might be the same, but you can't expect to have to stop sound going through a four and a half inch wall can you? We had a piano but nobody Mm. ever complained about us practising. Well, you got good neighbours then, that's all I can say. She came and knocked on the door and then we went back and I, I said what you stopped for? I says er, so I said, started playing ten minutes, she couldn't have got up the stairs and were back again! Mm! Asking us to stop. So that was it. That ended the first on my piano. I mean, you can't practise piano if people next door complain can you? Can you? Well I mean er Well most people did have pianos and er practised. Well, you know when I used to come to you walk across cos of the trams, Christmas day, all down Argyle Street every a a ev , they were bulging you know! Mm. But sometimes the door was open and they'd do it all out the front doors like this a and fresh, fresh people trying to get in. And th the pianos were going full blast!

Trouble is, if you remove moles you just leave an evolutionary niche for them and they're another lot move into the field, you can never get rid of them because if you remove your own private moles another Mm. lot come in, you see. Mm. Oh how lovely! But do you mean that they wouldn't try and Oh they're really lovely! visit if you had your own moles? Well no, but they won't over-densify, they wo won't make the population too dense, you see. I see. And th , you know,the they might spoil Might be things. mine come in Yes, I'm sure they will. and they go over the fields. Yeah. Yeah! And there are hundreds of the wretched Mm. . Mm. I consider four moles are too dense. Mm. Yes. One mole is too dense for me! Mm. Cos they always get under your favourite plant! Mm. Fay, can I pass you some more vegetables up? No, I'm doing fine thank you darling. But please encourage other people to have some. Well I'm sorry I've been trying to. I have here. Ha have some more veg. No,eat this one. And a little bit more. No it I'm fine thank you Noel. I hope you're never looking at me but I have to dinner. Why not! I put my life down to fish and Mollie , you know that my I dislocated my jaw in November mm. Mm? How? Just eating a sandwich! How could you? Cheese sandwich. I don't know! Mm. And it clicked and I, well occasionally before and very occasionally and I Might have I just the slightest sort of movement has readjusted it and this would not move at all! And erm I'm shovelling food now because it's so difficult! I still can't get it any wider . Really? Mm. Nope. Mm. Drop more wine Mollie? No thank you, I'm alright. . By the way those did I tell you they put me on some tablets to re to erm to erm No. relax the muscles, Really? Yes,. Well there must be something in it because I feel so relaxed these days I can't get oh really! Well that's nice! Don't flap about anything! Well er No quarrels. Erm, somebody tells me that Sarah is erm doing very well but has had a foul cold ever since she's been over there, is she very well now? Yes, she went with a yes she has. Mm. I phoned her on the fourth night to say goodnight to her that was all. spoken to her in the meantime Mhm. and she was actually, at nine o'clock Well she don't erm well in bed. Mm. lives at Foreham which is just the other side of . Mhm. She was very bad at start with the new people but then I'll take her up Mm. She can't make a commitment. But she can be very , she can be very secluded there. Mm. Mm. She can be just . I reckon she wants to Oh it's a lovely little lane I've I've always loved that lane. I know you think I'm Have you ? Have you? Yes. And lives on there. Well I've known Derek since I was six weeks old. I was taken there for the first time when I was six weeks old in a motor side car down from London to just within ten miles of Bury St Edmunds. Why I didn't die I don't know! We well, a motor side car! Yes, absolutely! I'm astonished erm because my grandmother wanted to see her first grandchild before she died. Oh yeah. And she died about two months later. At six weeks, You see I Connie. Really? and Connie, Connie's six weeks younger than I and grandma never saw her. Oh well she did but she had a grandson before that, she had a grandson who was born in eighteen ninety three and his name was on . I don't even Oh really? think that in those days anybody would have considered taking a child out like that, you know! They do it now! That's right. It drives me In a car me up the wall! Erm the things they will do for these new little things. I never used to feel I know. that mine were really here until they . Did it have a lasting effect on you Mollie? Well, you can be the judge of that! No,got it I think, yes! But then You don't like motorbikes and side cars do you Mollie? It's amazing really! No. Well I used to ride a motorbike a and my father had a Triumph motorbike because he bought I don't why he, why he bought it and he was terrified of it cos it was very fierce! And my brothers used to ride it, so I used to ride it and I rode it for miles! Did you? Then I rode it in a in an old Burberry and I don't how I started it, I think it was kick start. Mm, yes. Oh it must have been. And then we were at Frinton, masses of us, and we always used to go to Frinton in the summer because one of my uncles had a house there and we knew the people who erm dad used to play golf and mother used to knit on the beach, you know. Oh yes. Mm mm. And we used to th masses of cousins there and erm one one of my Jean, my cousin about ten months younger than I said, can I have a go Mollie? And I said, yes you see, gave her a try and so she went if you know Frinton you could go, in those days Yes I know it. you could go round, well it's the same now, but in those days you could go round, past the summer theatre and down Old Road where we were staying and on to a and do a circle you see? Mm. And we started her off and she went round and as she went past the second time she said I can't stop! Oh! oh! oh! Oh no! And then she went round again and we said well push so and so Oh my! How awful! And nobody had told her how to stop you know. I can remember not being able to get off my sister's much bigger push bike, just an ordinary push bike Oh yes! and I pedalled frantically round, didn't know how to get off again cos it was much too high. And I remember just sort of leaping onto some grass and just letting it go, you know, could of been . Oh I remember them emphatically Oh yes! now,. Yes, I know, I probably learn you see because I borrowed when I was about twelve and I remember bashing into a nanny with a pram. Oh, she was furious Oh dear! with me! I bet she was. I bet she was. cos of nowadays, well they didn't then because she was beastly to me now! Oh ! Now this is where the meal gets a little bit French because I have sauce to deal with. So you are left with erm conversation I'm going to top your glass up with a No thank you darling. No. I had an experience with a bike when I was very small a girl up the road was given a bike and I had quite quietly learnt how to ride a bike more or less. Mhm. And I, I said can I have a ride? And she said yes. And I went up and down the road and miles away then came back and I couldn't stop because this bike was very old fashioned and you had to stop it by pedalling back I know. pedalling backwards! Oh yes I know. I've heard of them! And I I I remember those. Well! pedalling backwards Mm. and I said there are no No. brakes! There are brakes! No. Oh dear! Anyhow I steered it straight up somebody's drive into their garden. Oh yes, up a hill or something. ! No. How awful! I've never ridden one but I've heard of it, with this back Yes, I've heard of it. Oh yes, that's right. Yeah. Be quite good, although you maybe do it by accident sometime and be rather jerky! That's what I thought earlier. That's very sudden you Oh! see. Mm. Back pedalling, mustn't you? Hey? Yo , you might stop sort of suddenly. Stop very suddenly. And then you'd Yes,yo well I I I yeah, no I have actually got No. th ridden one. No, I never have But certainly but I have of that. Well no not But I can remember riding this girl's Mm. bike can't stop! Can't stop! ! And so er er can Mm. remember riding up Mm. up this slope into a Yes. onto grass or something. How are your erm, I heard about erm, I've erm heard Sebastian lately but how is little Romley getting on, is he alright? Oh he's fine, yes! The Mm. they make too much fuss of him and they bring him back Yes. too often but Mm. Yes. Good! And John has got an order to build a new Orkingford Chapel. Oh at Which would John's! At John's. Oh how lovely! Oh have they, good! Yes. Mm. And that's the second one Oh that's lovely! since the war. Mm? They had Is it? Is it really? they had new one after the war. Why do they want another one? It's just isn't satisfactory. How extraordinary. No. John's gotta build a new one. Oh! He's not complaining? No. No. And at your old stamping ground. Gotta For what? to build one for Chelmsford Cathedral. Mhm. Really? I'm off Chelmsford Chelmsford? Cathedral! It's ghastly! I gather it is. And so is the bloody Bishop there! Yeah but he's Absolutely awful! very nice. And erm if you wanted to hear about Chelmsford Cathedral when Estelle who was a humorous and eighty something but still on the ball she'll tell you about the Who? Chelmsford Cathedral. Estelle . Who is that? sister. Oh sister! Oh yes And I've met her, I've met her! and erm ooh she's marvellous! Yes. She's be ,ei , eighty six and she lives alone and she's she's absolutely ge again, the Arch Deacon, it's the Arch Deacon there that's the trouble! He got a bulldozer to bull , to bulldoze up the erm aisles and bulldoze the sanctuary and he's thrown away, God knows what! I mean there are, there, there were erm all sorts of things there. And his, and he got rid of the beautiful eagle erm you know, reading desk and he got rid of the Bishops's erm, chair, the Bishop's what do they call it? Oh yes. Throne? The Bishop's throne! And he's put all wrought iron one there! Yeah. Well I Absolutely furious! Sh she won't I haven't been in go near it! Do you know what she does? On is the erm erm, nearly next door is the old erm Quaker Chapel Oh yes. the most beautiful building and nobody can pull it down, but Not the chapel Mollie? No, Not . Meeting House. Meeting House Meeting House yes. And opposite her is where the erm Quakers meet now because they can't afford to run the chapel the erm Meeting Meeting House. Meeting House as a big one and they are getting fewer. But she says I sometimes just walk across the road and go to the Meeting House at you know Well I've got a theory rather than the cathedral. Yeah. I've got a theory I have a feeling there's going to be a great revival of people with a Quakered mind way of thinking. Yes I I Yes. do agree. But the trouble is Noel, in the meantime erm the Quakers have fallen apart because the Quakers have filled themselves up with sort of barefooted raw carrot eaters with beads Well I know they have, yes I agree. with the and haven't, but haven't ever read That's right. the bible sort of Eastern religion type, meditation and thing and it's no good at all! The old fashioned Quakers who were sikhs and everything. Mm. Now, what I have learnt at college this week which is rather interesting I think. Well I think you'll be interested. Erm in the bible in the new part, the new testament, there's a er an epistle of James. Yes. Mm. Well I am told that that is the earliest thing at all. I'd say that. That is his erm actually a brother of Jesus in his family Yes. and so it's very much as he was thinking and it should be in the old testament really cos it was written you know, before Jesus Mm. That's right. before the, before the crucifixion. Erm, and it's been quickly Christianized with just two little lectures at the beginning of two chapters to Christianize so it was popped in for new testament and it's the nearest we can get to to teaching. And of course, it's totally Jewish Mm. but I'd say it's th it's th Je , the Jewish teaching as Christ would have preached it Mm. you see and it's for all the family. And there's, towards the end of the first chapter there's a bit all about erm erm er temptation and deliver us from evil kind of thing which is obviously rather from the, from the Lord's Prayer and yet it's, rather explained rather nicely and it, it's a lovely, lovely book! It's only five Do you know, I haven't ever read it. I will do of course. I've heard about that. It's lovely! It really is lovely! And you really feel that here is a I shan't be able to walk home! Really? It seems to be Mm. everything sort of, in a nutshell, you don't need any of the rest Oh well! of the new Mm. testament, that's just quite enough, it's just a just th the Jewish thing filled out slightly and and and a little bit less rules and, you know,i it's very, very lovely! Well apparently Chelms I've never read it , but I shall. We'll have a go, yes. Well that's what Chelmsford's got you see, Chelmsford was was full of Quaker! I mean, I can, I can erm quote the Quaker the families who still live there. Yes. Oh, all the important people were Quaker families when I lived there you see? And the erm the . The , I was gonna say them. Oh the were appalling! Ah yeah, the , the and I knew them. Oh yes! Yes. and erm What about the ? They're still there apparently The were Oh yes, they're still there! and the were the Norfolk more weren't they? Mm mm? Were the Norfolk more, were they? I think they were. Yes, I I mean I can't remember they and the and . By the time I can't remember now but they're at least five. I was thinking of them the other night, well they er, five at least erm they were th they were Quakers. But er ,,and something else, I can't remember them. I di , I always think of the , I met one or two of those. They're A when I go through Oh Mrs , off the train and still standing there with her name on her side. Mm. Yeah, that's right. Mm. Yeah. Oh they're lovely people! But er They ran everything. I'd been per wo ah I I feel that all this doctrine res religions are spoilt That's what I said! by doctrine. Exactly! Oh no! Nobody believes That's wrong! any of it now! I mean I think No I know. I know. Yeah, it's terribly sad! It's terribly sad! I think it's . Even the Bishop of Durham, I've just recently bought one of his books and I rather wish I hadn't, I'm not liking it much erm he's still much too orthodox really. Is he? You know he's still hanging on to Oh he is ? and trying to Mm. show Well I mean you can't you Mm. you can't get fish from prize thinking fish No. can you? No. But I know they blamed him for that. And he says you can because he says it's important for it to be a living thing that's got to change with the time. Mm. In all that way he's quite correct Mm. I think. It's just that he hasn't, to me, changed enough, he's still stuck up with all these various things. That really Well I know let's face it, if he, if he was really convinced of the falsity of most it he Mm. couldn't be a conscience to obtain his seat could he? Well he reckons you can say it in a different way. You can say Mm. it entirely symbolically and spiritually and and Mm. things don't Mm. have to have happened in fact. And that the stories were told to make a point and Mm. the trouble is, people have lost the point and kept the story! Erm, you know, it's saying that Well, the earliest man who used to think like this was Albert . Yes, oh yes course it Yeah. was! He wrote that marvellous book! Oh Well a lovely book! I've got about six of his books in there! Well I had all of his books. famous No, er, you mean erm I know quite a few . The er Christ, the Historic Jesus. Yes. With that famous last That is his best book chapter which is so lovely when Yeah. he sort of says well you still can spiritually meet Jesus even though you know, it's a rather lovely the last chapter! I say, he moves him the more you search for him historically Yeah. but there is a there's something hanging about still. But in a funny way, perhaps there is. I don't know. I'm very very, very, very, tied up with it, I I I invariably turn relatively happy with it all. I don't think one has to worry too much. Been brought up so much, bought up a Christian Yes, you just find it difficult to to admit that one's rather you know But certainly that epistle of James, to me, was just marvellous! Just everything! I, I can't Mm. ever remember reading James, If I had, I've forgotten about it. Mm. But I shall read him tonight. Well certainly, you'll enjoy it. Oh Did you go to 's er ? Yes. Er I chose the reading. Oh did you? Oh Yes. how lovely! Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yep. It Erm was very nicely done! Louis was very upset cos she forgot to erm have anyone to take the names erm Well so I wrote down as many as I could think of Mm. and erm and I asked Margaret , they had a better view where she was Mm. and she told a lot of other people and so I think we got a pretty comprehensive list actually. Oh, we couldn't er we No. we couldn't go anyhow. No. It was very packed in there but I couldn't see a lot of anything. But I was glad we couldn't because they asked me to read the lesson. No it it's miserable! Oh yeah. It spoils everything doesn't it? I'm glad to say Mm. and stuck to it. I think there were some people there who didn't really know, but they maybe went because they'd got to a funeral. Well it wasn't erm Oh it wasn't quite full enough. I think that's awful don't you? I I do, I do Mollie! But, we're doing the right thing for I the wrong reason. No this was probably, a relatively That's original idea. that's the, that's the wrong thing to do! Straightforward from there. Just having a cremation cos you're talked into doing something . I was, it's not a very And it's not very popular now. after. I must say, David worshipped rather well. but steered round it, saying how he admired them You said it. you're obviously going to make his daily up and down the village and and er I said one or two things You know, things you could say That's quite Erm true. and he did decide that I would like a cup of tea I wanted to say he had a great dedication. and she said that if you couldn't go, or telling him. And he was the only man in the British Legion who'd ever bought That's right darling. a drink. I I can manage see me any time you want. No, I did come . He didn't like. David He didn't. me and I usually always tell him off. and I've met people there who I know I knew. Yes, that's true. And I That's true. Absolutely! Oh sorry! But I thought it wasn't No, no, no, that's right. No, when people are dead you must See you bury them. Now Mollie that's, I haven't given you a large helping but it's a ginger pudding. I've been dying to make a good ginger pudding for years! I like ginger pudding. So wait and see if it's any good, I don't know. There now Mollie, there's some cream. Erm, sorry, some custard. Sauce! No I'll I Sauce. Oh sauce. Erm, is a, is is sauce essential? I should think on this. It it Okay. moistens it. It's an egg custard so it's, you know it's worthy Oh well of your attention. I have, if you Oh! don't mind but I don't like Heavens! Come on have some ! I don't like normal cream on everything. And it's only small helpings because you can come for more, okay? Normally I'm staged up providing your steering is smooth,positive and accurate,then we accept it. It's no real problem. So we realize we're not gonna be here to change the habits that have built up over a lifetime. You can't change habits like that b in two or three hours. But if there was an aspect of your steering like erm Right now listen folks. sh sh sh sh sh. Can I remind you please if you're answering a question can you please put your hand up so I can select . Some of you know Now way back a couple of weeks ago when we were doing the group seven the one that's spelt F C L B R I A T. Hands up who can remember what any of those stand for without looking on er You forgot the first rule put your hand up. Right fluorine is the actual element fluoride is the stuff that's in? Toothpaste. Toothpaste very good. You never put your hand up. Right C L Please sir is chloride Chloride is the is when it's joined up with something chlorine is the element. And what do we get chlorine in? Swimming baths. Swimming baths to? To take away all the nasty To kill the germs. Well it doesn't exactly kill them kill the it's got it's own smell which sort of tends to mask the smell but it's also basically to kill the germs. B R? Bromine. Bromine very good. And I? Iodine. Very good excellent. S so what I want you to show you this morning is how we can actually make the chlorine. So the people at the front yeah if if you come up a little bit closer. Now sh sh sh sh. Please Now I've got erm a bottle which is actually contains some chlorine here but it's not called chlorine liquid. I'll scratch this. Hydro Chloric. Chloric. chloric acid and it also says C O N C. Conc what is conc short for? It's short for a word yes. It starts with C O N C. Anybody? Conc is short for? Nose No conc er it's the beginning part of a word. If you use the word conc you're just meaning your nose . Conical. Ah now we're getting a bit more scientific. Conical if it was conical it would be C O N I conical. But it's conc. Now can you think of a wo c think of a word that describes the state of this liquid. And I'm going to hold the top while I show you. It's rather oily and it's quite a a dense liquid. Is it dangerous? It is dangerous yes. I'm gonna get some goggles on in a minute. What do you call liquid ah I'll give you a clue. What do you call a liquid that's very very strong? Concentrated liquid. Thank you concentrated. Now I Goggles on time folks. Now in this particular case I'm using a tap funnel Tap funnel just as it's it's Erm the concentrated acid you don't just sort of pour it in and run away and leave it to it. Let it in a little bit at a time. Just slow Slowly let the acid in. Then turn it off. Right now so the tap is to control the speed at which the acid goes in and if there is any gas that's in there it can't escape out of that pipe again it's got to go down the other pipe. So it's a safe it's a safety feature and it helps control the experiment. So we control the speed at which the acid goes in. And once it's in there it prevents the gas from escaping. Now at the moment the black chemical that's in there is not doing a great deal. The black powder's just sort of gone to a a sludgy paste . The powder's just gone it's dissolved a little bit but it's not really doing much on its own. So in order to speed it up a little bit we might need need to heat it up. Who said that? Me. Well done. Now who's going to go next door to get the gas switched on? What? Right Listen again sh sh sh sh sh. Done it. Sh Now in order to help this black powder to split up the acid. We're going to have to heat it up a little bit. Now again I'm treating it carefully I'm not just sticking the bunsen underneath and blasting away at it. I've got the Graham wanted to well unfortunately Graham this one's a bit dangerous so I'm having to do it so if anything goes wrong it's me that gets it and not you. Well because I've got all the dirty chemicals Sh. Please. Erm How will we know how will we know if there's any gas escaping? What. What's this paper? P H paper. P H paper. So I'm going to moisten it. Because of the gas that's drifting around in here What? The gas can you can you set fire to it? No it's not a flammable gas. But it is poisonous so if I start smelling it I'm going have to switch the cupboard on to suck the fumes away. Lorraine. Now this P H test I've only had it a few seconds and already look what it's done to the paper. Where I've wet it what's it done to it? Turned it yellow. It's turned it yellow and where it was dry it's now going what colour? Red. Red. Red means it's An acid. an acid. And because this takes what do you call something what do you call something that takes the colour away? Bleach. those are old pieces of paper. Come on somebody what do you call a chemical A what? Not a neutralizer. Andrew? We call a chemical that takes that takes Now you'll see it. What colour's the gas? Green. Right it's a green gas and it's also what it does it to this paper turns it acid to start with and then takes the colour away it is a bleach. Bleach gas. Now because it was frothing up I've turned the bunsen off to control the reaction it's slowing down again now. And you can see the colour. What colour's bromine on that list? Black. Black. What colour's iodine on that list? Black. Blue. Not it's not blue. Purple And they're all poisonous and they will bleach this the be this is probably the best bleacher. This is highest the highest up up the list that we can do. We can do reactions from F too dangerous. Now sh sh sh sh sh sh. Now this one I'm going to show you this one this time. Karina? Mm? Why do we use the tap funnel again? Cos we've got a tap funnel. so if there's any gas Yeah right it can't get out it has to go down the pipe. Sir? Stop shuffling. Sh. Can anybody oh I bet you'll never guess this one. Why have I got a conical flask instead of a round flask? Here's the answer. The round flask is broken. Erm I've go some purple crystals believe it or not. now this one's a bit more powerful this purple chemical. Shouldn't need heating up. If I put this white if I put the white paper behind the flask, can you see the gas that's in there? Yes a yellowy gas. Yellowy gas right and Sir? Yes? Is that flammable? It's not flammable it's poisonous it's acid and it bleaches. It could yes in the in the First World War er they used It would But how long would it take? It depends how much you got into whether you had asthma or not. You might you might have after you've s had some of this. Now can I explain this part over here look at this. Sh sh. Er right I've got this contraption upside down leading into a a trough of water. Can anybody guess why? There's something else that this gas does in water. If you'd got enough gas it would make bubbles. But we've only got a small supply remember. It may do . What do what do things normally do in water. Sometimes they move yeah. Anything else if you just put some Right they sink or float. What else do they do after they've either sunk or floated? Rust. They might rust yeah. Or turn to a well what do you call it when they turn to a liquid. What's the word? They what? They liquidize. Liquidize. They liquidize but you can liquidize things by heating them up that would liquidize them but in this particular case you just mix them with some water what's the process called? To turn it into It's called what? If you stir some sugar into water. Dissolves. It dissolves okay. If this gas if this gas dissolves too quickly it'll suck the water back up the tube and into this flask. It could be dangerous because if you're sucking water into acid you could have problems. So Lorraine I've got this upside down funnel and that prevents the water from being sucked up. How do I know I've got some chlorine in the water. Well look what's happening to these test papers. They're not acid any longer what's happened to them? Mark what's happened to that that test the P H paper there? It's all gone white. It's gone white what's the pr what's the pr what do we call it it's been? Bleached. Bleached. So I've got some bleaching yeah smell you can smell that bleach. I've got some bleaching chemical. Wave it past your nose you don't sn Don't don't just I'll just wave it past your nose. You don't want to much cos remember it is er poisonous. Anybody else want no? You want a smell? Right. So sh sh sh sh sh let's just sum up. What was the liquid we started with? What was the liquid we started with? Erm oh that conc Concentrated hydrochloric acid. It's got chlorine in it. We used a black chemical to start with but in order to that to help that we needed some heat. And this one works on its own this purple chemical is more powerful and works on its own. Adam can you go and turn the gas off? Right now I don't know Mr. 's trying to book some. What? Erm science trips. Where to? Somewhere in The Science Museum in London? No no no erm somewhere in Yorkshire. Somewhere where? Somewhere in Yorkshire. Er yes a gas gas gas fired power station . Right can you go back to your places. Right now Sir have s have you seen Pride and Prejudice and the telly? Can you look after those folks. Well well did anything happen when I put the acid in? Did any any of you three see what anything that happened in the first one. so we had to put some a bit of heat in. Nothing happened acid on its own. Now we got . Let's Right excuse me. too small. Erm does anybody know what this M N O two business is? Have a look on your your periodic table and see if you can work out what M N O two. You should know what O O stands for. M N O two anybody? Nitric oxide. Something oxide yeah. Part way there come on M N have a look on your page one of this module. Work look up what M N stands for. Anybody worked it out come on M N O two. Magnesium. Very close but not quite right. Not magnesium. Have a look look very close it's not mag it's No oh that's capital N this is a little N M N. That's it right. M N Oxidizes Go on read it what is it? Magnesium. No have you looked closer. Manganese. Manganese manganese oxide. Please. There you go. Manganese oxide erm the back row decided. Manganese oxide. Erm Excuse me sir thanks sir. universal liquid. Or a piece of universal paper or . What does K M N O four stand for? What does K stand for anybody work that one out on your periodic table. K for anybody remember cos we've done this group. What's this paper paper called? P H. Yeah that's P H. Yes it is. No not chrome. Anybody what's K? Potassium. Well done. Yes I know because it's come from an old an old word an old . Er K potassium yes. Erm then we've got a manganese K M N O four. It's got two metals . How which one's got most which one's got most oxygen in it the K M N O four or the or the M N O two? M N O two. Why? That's a guess. Well look at the numbers. M N O two K M N O four. Oh I thought K M N O four. Yeah why? Cos it's got number four. It's got four oxygen atoms and that's only got two oxygen atoms. Well done Michael. So K M N O four's got more oxygen. Erm what does this word property mean in number four? Property. Now you're gonna tell me a property is something that you can Yes something that's good about it very good. So what's what what are what's chlorine got that say no other gas has? It's a germ killer yeah anything else? Er. How would know it if I brought a jar full into the room? Smell it. Smell it. Right erm what else. How would we know a jar was full compared with an empty jar. Just to look at if the lid was on. You can see it. Why? You can smell it. No we've the lids on this time. Sir it was oily and you can see it. No that was some drops of acid that you could see We're trying to work out what the properties of this gas if you're not listening you won't be able to do number four. It's smelly it's yes it's poisonous yes that's a property good. Another one? Mm that's a use not a property. What colour It's yellowy green yes How we doing folks? Good. Sir I've finished. Right goo you know that erm acid thing you were doing this one be finishing that off. I dunno I can't remember. You marked it. and have you done a key Yes. Well a key should have a little bit at the bottom to say what what's it stands for. Oh you've done that red ones, yellow ones, where's your yellow ones Your key doesn't match your chart. You've put green ones and they're the metals . Your green ones are the alkali earth metals. You've got this all all wrong. Tell you what I'll get you another one. How are we doing ladies okay? Number five oh Can anybody tell er on number five why we got the upside down funnel. No. Now come on this is a check of who was listening Why have I why have we got that upside down funnel? Sh sh sh sh. Sh sh er no. What does the gas do to the water? Mark Mark Mark. It does but it might also do the gas might do something else as well. Turn the water green. How could it turn the water green what would it have to do in the water? Bubble. Come on we're going back to this shove it in water business again. Oh it dissolves. Dissolves stop it from sucking the liquid back again. dissolves to the stop the liquid from being sucked back into . The gas dissolves. the gas starts to come off when I just put the acid in. Yeah so you've got to heat it up . paper some P H erm Darren Darren sit down please. that funnel right now how did we control the speed at which the acid went in. With a tap. And then once all the acid was in if you left the tape open what would happen to the gas? It would just escape so we sh close the top and the gas has got to . Down the tube and into Yeah down the other tube and into the what's the thingumajiggy? What do you call it that tall cylinder thing? Thingumajiggy? You'll never guess it's for collecting gases so we call it a Gas . Gas jar. Not far off. Oh. Now come on. Speed it u yeah cos the black powder wasn't powerful enough. Can anybody tell me why the black powder's not powerful enough. Look at the shorthand for it M N O two it's not got so much? Oxygen. Very good it's not got so much oxygen. So you've got to give it some heat to help the oxygen to work. Now if anybody's finished and is wondering what to do check through and make sure everything is up to date. And then I've got some work here for those who thing everything's up to date. So don't start this work until everything else is up to date. It's on the end of this . And if anybody's been away and has got or has got missing sheets I've got spare sheets down here. Question sheets Don't forget your acid posters by the way. Or you getting another one. It's Right I would. The only problem is I haven't got many colours. You'd you'd do better to use your own colours if you've got . How are you doing okay Dean? Oh right well you need Oh not again. Right who can tell yes go on Michael. To let the acid in. To let not out to let what in slowly. The acid in slowly right. It lets the acid in slowly and once the acids in what does it stop next? Carbon dioxide So whatever's in there can't get out up there it's got to go through another pipe it's got to go through the other pipe. Two two reasons. To stop the gas from escaping and to let the acid in bit by bit. Sir? Yeah. Er you could put P H or universal or any antacid indicator. Sir Properties who can tell me a property of this gas. Look at it in through the in the fume cupboard I can see one from here. Green. It's green right good. It it's a bit misty alright fair enough that's a property. Anything else? If it can fall down out of that pipe into the jar it must be? Very good be heavy. If it erm sucks the water up if you're not careful it must. How can it suck the water up by? It hasn't actually done cos I put that funnel on the end to stop it from doing it. Yeah it would cause a vacuum as it dissolves. So it dissolves obviously. Have you got the smell one have you put the smell smell one down. Smells of? Swimming baths or bleach or You can put some universal indicator or erm P H paper or To stop it from sucking because it dissolves too well It's like you in there drinking drinking er coke out of a straw if you you suck enough It'll all end up in your mouth. If you just put a pipe straight in the end of the liquid it would suck the liquid up. Right Darren if you've finished the qu To s stop from sucking up Now who's finished? Number three you could on the filter paper I've out some of those P H test papers. You could put universal, P H, litmus anything. Oh yeah probably we don't stop just cos you're not . Are there any I've got the index out here if you want one. I'll thank 'em all very much then. Oh fine you want to thank them now. Can I thank you all very much for being cooperative. Come in. Good morning. Hello Doctor. Now stranger, what can we do for you this morning? a long time. A number of years. Aye, it's a long number of years. You've got spots . Mhm . I was told it was chicken pox, but I haven't Mhm. been to a doctor. Aye. I've had this for over a fortnight. Did it just come on all of a sudden? I think what happened it started on my legs, here. Right? Oh deary me . Now for a while, before I went to, I went to . That's turned into . Right. It's okay. we'll get that cleared for you. I thought it was Yeah. like that. No. Four or five days and it should all be starting to I hope it's not turning . A germ, there's a germ that floats about in the air and if it gets onto the skin when it's broken. It Was it? Was it originally . Well it looks as though it could well have been originally chicken pox? like chicken pox. Yeah. But that's all it takes, it's just the skin to get broken, and underneath the skin and it just spreads and it's And you haven't seen my arms. Same. Alright. Okay. My arms are really bad. Let's get that sorted for you. it was chicken pox and I'm saying to myself it's very infectious. What about , is that infectious? Yes. That's contagious as well. And the funny thing was I've Mm. only been off my work for about er seven days. I was at my work for a couple of days, Mhm. when this started. Yeah. So I must have passed it on . Aye. Impetigo isn't nearly as easy to pass on as chicken pox. In fact it's, it's really You have to be living in the same house as somebody who's I was ask asking myself . Aye. You, you've got to be using that same towels, you know, that sort of thing. Aha. You know, actually,mo all more or less direct contact Aha. before you can pick it up. Mhm. So there's no terrible worry in that way, that you've passed on to anybody. And that, I wouldn't worry about that. get that thing? Ah, you could get it anywhere, I mean even, see the likes of that, that wee cut in the back of my hand? Aha. Well it could start off in that. Just just . See I always wondered because er it seemed awfully slow in spreading it, it was there that's right. and a couple of days with nothing happening I'm saying, well, at least it's started clearing up, but then And then it moved somewhere else. it moved somewhere else and I'm saying I'm looking at it That's right. the only place I've not got it is my abdomen and my chest. Right down the front. It had nowhere to go. Aye. And it started on my back quite a bit, three of four days ago, well it's not just as bad but my arms are real bad. Right. Let's see if we can get you turned into a human being. Oh dear, and I'm saying to myself it was chicken pox Aye, but I don't think I've heard of that impetigo Doctor to be honest. Yeah. it's years and . It used to be quite a common thing. Yes. Correct. Aye, I remember. Ah, but it's y you still see it, I mean we still see it about once or twice every week. Mhm. But I mean it used to be every day Aye. we used to see it. So, it all cleared up okay? It won't Yes. Och aye. leave a lot of marks? No? Well, I suppose it . hopefully not. No. No. No. Now not nowadays, not with the, not with the stuff we get nowadays. Now. Now. Now. And what I've noticed is I've seen my bed linen. It's been weeping at night when I'm sleeping.

But that should do the trick Mary And I and it'll settle it'll settle this as well. And will I come back again or will I? Three weeks. Three weeks? Do you work? You know back here to see how Aye. you're doing. Because it's alright doing my round the ankle and all? Yeah. Well we need to Sore. get skip ropes for you. I need to I need exercise. Right Mary. Right. Thank you. Okay. Cheerio now. Cheerio. Feeling blue? What do you do? One hundred women have an idea or two. Talking about depression is not something we do much, which is odd really because everybody gets depressed and vast numbers of us need help from time to time. Though because perhaps we feel guilty or embarrassed about the whole area of mental health we're not tackling the problems when they come up nearly as well we might. So we're going to try and start to change all that now. Let me ask the one hundred women here, have you ever been depressed? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And perhaps the only surprising thing about that result is that, is that seven people have said no! Ninety three have said yes. Let me ask you whether you would regard yourself a depressive person? Would you say are depressive rather than simply get depressed? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And there, only sixteen say they're depressive er people, eighty four no but the great majority here have been depressed from time to time. About what? I mean th a great variety of things are depressing but can you identify what makes you depressed? Lack of money. Sorry? Lack of money. Lack of money. And that's something, that must be a very Aha. common one? Aha. And then that your, your household is well, the sort of er, someone's lost their job, you know, you start what are we're gonna do? You know, how are we gonna manage? Mm. Etcetera. Who else? Ya? After a baby. Baby blues. Baby blues. Did you have baby blues? Yes. After my last one. Just after one? After the last one. What's it like? Absolutely terrible! Horrendous! What did you I , well I just didn't realize it was anything like that, I had I've had four children and the last one there was thirteen years difference between them and it was really, really terrible! He was about six months old and I didn't know what was wrong with me. How long did it last? About three months before I finally, I was husband made me go to the doctor or go to the doctors for me and that's when I realized it was depression I didn't know anything about it then. Really? Had you not been warned? Had you not No. read anything? No. Yes? Sometimes you don't need anything to make Mhm. you depressed. Mhm. Sometimes you've got a depressive illness. You know, a manic depressive or a schizophrenic or whatever. Yeah. Beside you. Living with somebody depressive has made me depressed on frequent occasions and th th the feelings of helplessness that you have in dealing with the person's depression. Yeah? Erm, one of the things that depresses me, is probably the main thing that depresses me is not being valued for what I am or what I do and I think many women suffer from depression because their strengths and their creativity are not recognised and valued. Mm. Anna? Being a single parent. Is that depressing? Yeah cos there's, on your own all the time and you feel you've got no time for yourself and that can be fairly bad at times. Yeah. Er, it's not just single parents, I think er, married couples as well cos I think Yep. society expects everybody to cope well and they don't. So I think that can become quite depressive as well. Up there. I think from what everyone's saying being a woman in Scotland today is that in itself er, a cause for depression. I think trying to exist in society at the moment is extremely difficult. And there's wi wide er, spread unemployment and there's the stress of being as that lady said, a single parent, erm, for women who work and have families they have their old conflict between what they're doing, doing at home and what they're doing at their work and who should have a priority. So I think erm, just a combination of trying to get through the week can be a sort of depression for many women. How do you cope with it, the ninety three of you who get depressed from time to time, whether it's severely or or or or not so severely? I think it's a matter of giving yourself time of accepting that maybe you're feeling low or I fe , when I'm feeling low I say right, I can't cope with things I've got to give myself some time where nothing's gonna bother me, if I can manage it, an hour, half an hour, just doing something for myself that I really like and that helps me once I accept myself as being depressed then it helps alleviate the stress involved with it. Is that something you think would work for everyone. I think it's worth a try. Doing something you like, if you can give yourself half an hour, or an hour, you know just say this is for me, and for me only. Mm mm. I think with erm, I I was brought up in a household where it was com , completely legitimate to admit to being depressed and that you would just have to cope, I think cope perhaps my most Mm. least favourite word in the entire language! Women coping all over the Mm. place with Mm. all sorts of terrible stresses and the only sort of legitimate reason for collapsing is to allow somebody else to cope beautifully with your collapse. I think with er, it's very interesting that people are actually admitting that they feel depressed and they have strategies for dealing with it. I'm sure it's re relatively recent. It probably is. It'll be useful Mm. to hear more of the strategies. Yes? I think it's important to get a listening ear and know that there are other people around who will give you support. You have to search that out. I'm not su , absolutely convinced, in terms of saying Mm. having an hour away from it is enough, I think there are a number of women who need to look and get support from somewhere. Is that hard to do would you say? Erm I think well I think it is, at times. I think in terms of people knowing, in terms of women knowing where they actually can get that support from. And also actually getting them there, themselves there in the first place is very difficult. Where's the yes? I think it helps if you can identify whether the the erm depression is just caused by erm the circumstances round about you which can be alleviated by changing them or if it's caused by eating habits or erm or erm hormones or chemical imbalances in, I've suffered, I think, from all them as well! Say like erm th stresses we're all under will cause depression, but after my had my children I suffered from reactive hyperglycaemia, low blood sugar, and we , that was glucose intolerance and I think an awful lot of women erm, suffer th from this and it's not erm found out and knowing the glucose intolerance I can understand how a lot of children erm, suffer from er problems with eating habits because I think this is being discovered more and more Mm mm. and I think society should be erm, trying to get to the root cause of like, chemical imbalances and eating problems rather than just putting people on tranquillizers. Well I wonder how many people here, I mean ninety three people say they ha , they th they occasionally do get depressed, I wonder if you ever have taken er, mood controlling drugs such as tranquillizers? Have you? Button one for yes, button two for no. It's erm it's regarded as er as an increasing problem er amongst women. Thirty nine have. Now we're talking about how you cope, the thirty nine who have do they work? Don't they work? Would you recommend it or wouldn't you? And obviously everybody has a different experience of this. Yes? Er, I actually had two stillborn babies, one one year after each other and they put me on Valium and it didn't do me any good at all! And my little boy was he was only about three at the time and I used to be used to angry at him and my neighbour used to come in and take him. And I was married to a soldier so I didn't have any family round about me at the time so it was it was pretty hard. And coming off valium was a lot harder because you don't realize that when you're on it you can't get back off it again. Did you, did you get help coming off it? Erm Well you were obviously, well you prescribed it in the first place Well that was supposed to be help. it was, it was actually there was a programme on television and my husband took me to the doctor and he said he felt I'd been on it too long, I'd been on it about six months and when I come off it, I come off it pretty quick and I ended up erm I didn't know what was wrong with me and it ended up I've now got epilepsy, and they didn't know if it was caused through erm I took a stroke about three four month after that and then I got the epilepsy as well, so they don't know if that me coming off it Mm mm. straight away, I just stopped it. Down there. Erm, I was erm, put on just for in ninety seventy three and your question that you're asked was and from nineteen seventy three till three years ago erm I know took my causes, I trust, put my trust in the doctors and erm over all those years I didn't realize that it was actually the tablets that was causing me the mental illness. And saying that, in the last three years I since discovered, and it was quite difficult to, which I did find, that there was alternative erm therapists, which was lots of groups that were going on and once I got into it erm the , it opened up a new, you know I ne I've never saw the light at the tunnel that is shining brightly now! Has anybody had the opposite experience with er with the kind of the drugs we're talking about, whereby they have been helpful and th , and they, and they would recommend them? Yeah? Er, I think anti-depressants can be helpful for a certain length of time but not for over a prolonged period of time. Erm and I think there's a big difference between them and tranquillizers and people tend to get the two mixed up. I think tranquillizers can be useful as well for a very short time limited period. Erm, but I certainly found anti-depressants helpful. Mm. Yes? Yes. I just wanted to say that speaking as a psychiatrist Mhm. valium is not an accepted treatment for depression and that we have excellent anti-depressant drugs, particularly ones that have come just in recent years that are very effective for depression, and I think bringing a great deal of benefit to depressed people. Well Ray say,i i I mean it's important that we yo you find out whether you are depressive, whether you have er ag , oh, something clinically wrong with you, whether you're just feeling a bit down. But perhaps we don't really know enough and we don't know where to go for information, I mean I don't know er I, I I'm not an expert but there are experts here, how would you assess the services available to people who feel they do need help, or for people who perhaps don't know they need help? Yes? Yes I think the situation in Scotland is very poor! I'm, I'm an alternative medicine practitioner and I tend to get a lot of people who are depressed coming to see me, people who have been through the normal routes Mhm. gone to their GP's, and often have been given some sort of medicine for their depression but haven't had the counselling side of things dealt with and they've just been given re-prescriptions, not necessarily seen every time for a re-prescription. Behind you. I think there are a number of counselling services available, but I also think it's very difficult sometimes for women to get there Mhm. and it's it's something about the shame around depression that we don't actually come forward for counselling and there's certainly not enough free counselling services in Scotland. There. I'm also an alternative therapist and I do find that this is one of the major problems, that ninety percent of my patients who come to me suffer from stress and depression, and really what has happened in a lot of cases is that they have been put on valium and drugs, they find the side effects are horrific! And actually really in a last resort in many cases they come to you. Mm. Mm. I went through a period of depression erm I'd been attending the doctor I'd been told that I was suffering from various illnesses, but nothing helped. I was given anti- depressants, that didn't help and it wasn't until four years later when they actually admitted me to hospital and then an ulcer and the depression disappeared once it had been diagnosed. But all the time I'd been attending the doctor I'd been told, first of all it was gall stones Mm. then it was something else Mm. then it was something else and I honestly thought the doctor thought I was cracked! There's nothing the matter with me! And I was taken into hospital and it was an ulcer and the depression disappeared after that. Mm. There. I think speaking as another psychiatrist er the medical profession do have to look very carefully and perhaps how a lot of the damage has been done er with how women perceive whether they can ask for help or not because a lot of the women here have raised been giving tranquillizers and my colleague across there has pointed out that tranquillizers are not an appropriate way of treating depression. Mhm. And diagnosis is very, very important that, if you have a medical, clinical state of depression try and pull yourself out of it, by your, your own efforts and doing alternative things is not necessarily going to be effective. And diagnosis is very important, as a psychiatrist again, training our medical students, we are trying to do a lot of education along that line because perhaps some of the older GP's, along the way, have not recognised the importance of this. Well I, I went to a psychiatrist once looking for a self-help group cos I didn't want tablets or anything I just wanted somebody I could talk to. Mhm. But what I found when I went was I had to go through the psychiatrist to find this group cos it wasn't available. My doctor didn't know anything about it. So having gone there I got counselling which I found was very useful to me. More useful than all the medications and so forth like them. So once you found it Aha. it was helpful? Yes? Up there. Yes. Now, when I took post-natal depression I asked my health visitor, you know, where do you go? And she sent me to a mother and toddler group, I mean, she didn't tell me about any self-help groups, it's mother and toddler, she just said take you and the baby and go to mother and toddler and that'll be it. And that's all the help I got from my G P. Beside you. I found that erm, we run par , a self-help group as well for ladies with post-natal depression Mhm. and I found, for me personally and a lot of other mothers that it started in pregnancy. Now, I don't know if anybody's had the experience but they're only interested in your unborn child, they're not interested in how you feel at that time. I mean, you think you give birth and you're forgotten, I mean your health visitor visits your baby, and then you've got the baby blues, and we we are trying to do something to get them to help and warn people about when they are pregnant it can happen because it does start then, not after you've had the baby, it builds up and them wham, it hits you! Yes? I think mental illness isn't taken seriously enough. I think that er, there's a problem, first of all you've identified that women experience er, depression and I think that's not taken very seriously by policy makers and people in power,na namely men. I think women get depressed but men suffer from stress which is somehow more respectable it's more macho, it's associated with work and Aha. you know, there are all sorts of means of dealing with stress Mhm. which are not always open to women. But it's more pu , you know, it's almost de rigueur,mo amongst certain types of executive to be suffering from stress. And I suspect it's the same kind of actual physical complaint that women who complained of being depressed have. Yes? Women have a lot different stress than men. Men Mm. go out nine to five to work, they are stressed nine till five, women, especially women with children have it twenty Mhm. four hours a day, they don't have a nine to five job, they're on call twenty four hours a day and that's a lot more stressful. Mhm. I think that men tend to rely more on a crutch such as alcohol I don't if it relieves Mm mm. the problem more but it tends to be men that cope in that way and women aren't seen to cope as well, maybe they just don't use things like alcohol Mhm. as much as the men. Well I'm vo involved in Crossline which is a a Christian run telephone helpline, erm, we off , also offer free counselling and they find that er, there's more men will actually pick up the telephone, cos they're not seen erm, whereas more women will actually come in for face to face counselling. I think it's a stigma that a lot of men feel they can't show that they're depressed or they've got a problem so they'll pick up a ph , a phone. Yes? Well as the speaker before last mentioned, men are in fact diagnosed twice as often as women are suffering from alcoholism. I think men tend to act out their depression more than women. Yes? I'd just like to raise a point that erm most men are psychiat , er mo most of the psychiatrists are men and that a lot of the diagnosis I feel, come from a very sort of patriarchal view erm, you know a lot of have sort of brought up the alternative sort of er medicine and er self-help groups, and to me, having been through psychiatry which is a, a huge machine that is very difficult to get out that er to me, that's the only future and there's millions of pounds going into psychiatry and we're reviewing it now with community care plans which, I I don't think anybody is actually clear about but er, you know, the the millions that are put into psychiatry, I'd like to see more sort of counselling er, become available or, more money given to sort of er mental health associations. Mhm. Following, from what was said there we know that there's, that there's a limited pot for mental health because that's the way it's going to be, we've been told that so there's a real big job for women Mhm. to look at er, a P R job about changing the way those resources are used so that they're used in the way that's been talked away, er, talked about tonight which is way that clearly many wo , many women want to see them being used. And women have to got to get, get out there and ensure that the people who do plan the way that these services are are operated and managed an an all the things evaluated, that women have a real say in that. Which women? The women who are the professionals in the field or being No. The women who will use the services, women who have used the services in the past, and women who will use them in the future, and that's all of us. Now, say more about that practically, because I mean if you're depressed, you may feel too depressed to go to a a professional, you may have great difficulty getting there for whatever reason because you're ashamed as someone mentioned, you're embarrassed, you don't want to admit you can't cope, which is a syndrome once you get there how do you pluck up the courage to say well actually what your offering me isn't good enough, I've heard on on television there is something better and I want it? Gosh! There'll be other people here who I'm sure who have done it. But, it's up to organisations like the ones we work for to respond to that and to not be doing the planning on behalf of other people. Yes? I think we're still talking here about depression and how to go and Mm. find a cure erm perhaps we should try and think about why we get depressed in the first place, I know there's lot of people who co , here have had problems. I think it's important to find space for ourselves which sometimes we just don't do. You know, find things to do to occupy ourselves in other ways. You mean cope? Mm. Well, no not cope but to to enable us to cope we have find space for ourselves, do something, purely for ourselves rather than always be thinking about our children, thinking about the home thinking about the family, we're as important and I think that's what people must realize to begin with. Yes? I suffer more from a feeling of guilt, perhaps than men do. I think it's part of a vicious circle, that sometimes it's guilt which leads to depression and then women feel guilty about being depressed and that's why they take what is on offer to them. I think there's a great cult of perfection amongst women, that they're trying to be all Aha. things to all people all the time. Research has shown recently that erm a life event, such as you described can precipitate depression in someone who's self esteem is low and I think this is where we women are more vulnerable. Although we've advanced a great deal in the last fifty years, we still have a way to go and our self esteem is lower than men. I want to turn this right round because a couple of people have mentioned guilt and er I I suspect that one of the reasons that women are a bit worried about talking about depression or or campaigning for changes in policy, or more funding, or or whatever, is that for a long time women have been thought of as the weaker sex, more emotional, more nervous, by a, a a male establishment, I'm talking about past centuries, isn't there a case for saying there's actually we have a right to be depressed, I mean, obviously it's normal, ninety three of you get depressed from time to time, the majority of you don't think you clinically depressive if it is, if it's normal to be depressed shouldn't the services to cope with depression, if we need outside help, be there and there's no shame in it? I mean, you've got the right to go to the dentist, the right to go to the doctor! Yes? I think what would be helpful for all of us is to think of our er mental health rather than mental illness Mhm. and er, you know it's part of a spectrum, and if we're all as aware of er mental health as we are with physical health now, and if that was, was carried out in public education campaigns and in schools, I think you're right, we would have this right to mental illness as part of a overall mental health. Ray? Erm, it is part of the e education curriculum and design, the development of inter-personal, pschyo-motor and cognition skills apparently so if the experts e actually gave me galloping schizophrenia because on one hand I thought hallelujah and in the other hand will we make as mak , bigger mess of this as they did in multi=sensory teaching methods in a coordinative approach to learning? What are the experts view on this? How are they going to manage to implement this without making the situation any worse! You'll blind us with science if we go into that right now! Yes? Erm, I think one of the important bits is th , the issue of why is is part of it, why people get depressed? And I think it's, a great deal of it is to do with failed expectations. Whose? And people get depressed, like when they're dealing with bereavement, that's an event in a person's life and causes short term dis , short term, very intense distress, but that's different from the way we're constructed through the media and all sorts of ways to be super mothers, super wives, super kiddie and a super this that and the next thing which none of use can meet all these demands at one go! But because, the media hold out these expectations as the norm and people can't meet them all, they then feel failures Aha. and that is also why, going back to a point earlier on, why I think erm counselling and alternative medicine, and so on, is marginalized it would be such a rock to the social order to actually acknowledge that people are in distress because it's the social order that's causing that distress. It's the media again! But it's tru And the patriarchal society. But I just wanted to bring up some of the underlying reasons for depression, and one of the large things that society is having to address just now is child sexual abuse Mhm. which er er in my profession as well I come up against all the time and I I think that we're not really acknowledging that that is very often a cause, for men and women Mhm. er of future mental health problems. Beside you. Yes. I I wonder really, the only rational appro , response to the world at the moment isn't to be depressed, I mean, everyone looks around famines in Africa, and war and jus and depredation Mm Mhm. all around us Mhm. as well as more domestic problems within Scotland of unemployment and so on, I mean, really depression should be regarded as a normal response Mm. and what women are experiencing half the time is perfectly rational. Yes. I don't actually believe that that depression is normal, I believe that we can overcome depression, and I think there is some creative things that we can do out of a depression people can become stronger, they can tap into their resources inside with support and help, so I can believe it's a positive experience. Mhm. I think that it's important to recognize that to have a depressed mood is not to have a depressed illness Mhm. we all can get depressed if we're talking about a mood state, that's not an illness. Depression, as an illness is not normal any more than having
